ROKON [OC]: Eldrad, the traitor, destroyer of the barriers, sentenced
to obliteration. Eldrad. <br>
(A figure in an all-enveloping duvet suit goes to a small dome in the
blizzards and operates a control panel. Later, the figure is seen
sitting.) <br>
ROKON [OC]: Command to Dome Six. Command to Dome Six. <br>
(A second figure enters.) <br>
ROKON [OC]: Central Command to Outer Dome Six, report. Module status
report immediately, Technic Obarl. <br>
(The second figure shakes the first's shoulder. He falls to the floor. <br>
ROKON [OC]: Technic Obarl! Technic Obarl! <br>
ZAZZKA: Commander Zazzka here. Technic Obarl no longer operational. Orb
temperature continues to fall. <br>
ROKON [OC]: Report module status, immediate. <br>
ZAZZKA: Obliteration module on course and normal function. Now nineteen
spans into mission. <br>
ROKON [OC]: Computed time to detonation. <br>
ZAZZKA: Obliteration module will reach designated detonation point
beyond all solar systems in six spans, approximate. <br>
ROKON [OC]: Commander Zazzka, what is the barrier condition? <br>
ZAZZKA: Deteriorating. <br>
ROKON [OC]: The north has already fallen. When the south barrier
collapses, temperature loss will intensify. <br>
ZAZZKA: Then surface operations will no longer be possible. <br>
ROKON [OC]: Confirmed. These are new orders. The module is to be
triggered now, before control is lost completely. <br>
ZAZZKA: But King Rokon, sire. Total obliteration of the traitor Eldrad
was ordered. <br>
ROKON [OC]: Yes, yes. <br>
ZAZZKA: Computations indicate that at nineteen spans, there is still a
one in three million chance of particle survival. <br>
ROKON [OC]: We have no choice, Zazzka. Carry out new orders. <br>
ZAZZKA: Affirmative. <br>
(Zazzka hits the button on the frost-covered console, and the spaceship
explodes.) <br>
ZAZZKA: Obliteration module destroyed. Awaiting further orders. <br>
ROKON [OC]: Evacuate observation dome. Immediate. <br>
(Zazzka drags the frozen Obarl out, then the dome goes dark.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quarry]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In another part of space, on Earth, in Cromhall
Quarry, Wotton under Edge, Gloucestershire, the quarrymen are getting
ready to detonate a part of the quarry face. The siren wails as wires
are attached to each other and the dynamite, and the detonator cable is
played out. Then the Tardis materialises and the Doctor steps out. The
final wires are stripped and fastened to the detonator pack. Sarah
leaves the Tardis, wearing an Andy Pandy pair of dungarees.) <br>
SARAH: Oh. Listen, I don't want to make any snap decisions, but this
isn't South Croydon. <br>
DOCTOR: What? I can't hear you for the siren. <br>
SARAH: This isn't South Croydon! <br>
DOCTOR: All right, there's no need to shout. Hold this. <br>
(He gives her his coat.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now watch. <br>
(The Doctor bowls a stone at a large rock, knocking it over. They walk
on.) <br>
SARAH: Good for you. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it nice in South Croydon? <br>
SARAH: What? It's a paradise compared to this dump. I bet we're not
even on Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, maybe the season hasn't started yet. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you have a season in South Croydon? <br>
SARAH: Come on, where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: We're in a quarry. <br>
SARAH: Yes, I know we're in a quarry, but where? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, how do I know? I don't know all the quarries that <br>
(The Doctor stops. There is a figure waving at them from the ridge.) <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe he knows. <br>
ABBOTT: Get out of it! Go on, get out of it! Quick! Get out of the way!
No, Mike! Mike, no! <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe he knows South Croydon. Does he look as if he comes from
South <br>
SARAH: What? Siren! Run, Doctor! <br>
(They start running just as the detonator is plunged, and the quarry
wall explodes. Abbott runs down from the ridge. The Doctor pulls
himself up from behind a very large piece of rock.) <br>
ABBOTT: How the blazes did you get in here? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ABBOTT: Didn't you see the signs, the flags? Well, you must have heard
the hooter. Are you all right? <br>
(The Doctor looks at the pile of fractured rock behind him. The Tardis
is serenely untouched in the middle of the quarry.) <br>
DOCTOR: My friend's under that. <br>
(The other quarrymen come running.) <br>
ABBOTT: Oi, you lot! Get down here! And get an ambulance! <br>
(The Doctor spots his coat and goes over.) <br>
ABBOTT: Look, I don't want to sound heartless, but, well, I'm not
taking responsibility. You had no right in here. <br>
(As the ambulance heads for the quarry, Sarah wakes in a space
underneath a very large slab of rock. We can hear voices in the
background. In the foreground of the shot is a right hand, with a ring
on the fifth finger and the fourth one missing.) <br>
SARAH: Ow. I can't move. Doctor! Doctor, please, help. Doc. <br>
(Sarah reaches through the gap and grasps the hand, then screams.) <br>
QUARRYMAN: I think she's over here. <br>
DOCTOR: Steady, steady. <br>
(The Doctor peers in through a gap.) <br>
DOCTOR: She's here. Now, gently, gently. <br>
(The men lift the large slab away as the ambulance arrives.) <br>
ABBOTT: Mind how you go. Could be something else down there. <br>
QUARRYMAN: Keep it coming. Here we are, that does it. <br>
(The Doctor pulls an unconscious Sarah out of the hole and lays her on
another slab.) <br>
ABBOTT: Is she all right? <br>
DOCTOR: She's still breathing. <br>
ABBOTT: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I said, she's still breathing. <br>
(Abbott and the Doctor lay Sarah on the stretcher. Abbott sees the hand
in her hand.) <br>
ABBOTT: What on Earth? She won't let it go. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Get her off to the hospital, and quick.
Come on. <br>
(The ambulance man carry Sarah away on the stretcher.) <br>
ABBOTT: You ought to get yourself seen to, mate. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. I'll talk to you later. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In a cubicle, an Indian doctor checks the
Doctor's arm. When he gets near the wrist - ) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! <br>
INTERN: Did that hurt? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. <br>
INTERN: Wonderful thing, pain. Without pain, no race could survive. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm well aware of that. <br>
INTERN: Autonomic defence mechanism. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Tell me, how's Miss Smith? Sarah Jane Smith. We came in
together. <br>
INTERN: She is still unconscious, but there's no need to worry. We have
found no serious physical injury. <br>
DOCTOR: Paralysis? <br>
INTERN: Not as far as I know. You are a doctor yourself? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, sort of, yes. <br>
INTERN: How do you do? <br>
(And shakes the Doctor's injured hand.) <br>
INTERN: Tell me, where did you qualify, if I may ask? <br>
DOCTOR: A place called Gallifrey. <br>
INTERN: Gallifrey? No, I've not heard of it. Perhaps it's in Ireland. <br>
DOCTOR: Probably. Look, could I see Miss Smith, please? <br>
INTERN: I'd like you to take a look at Miss Smith. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hospital - private room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sarah is lying in bed, very still.) <br>
INTERN: Thank you, nurse. <br>
(He looks at her eyes.) <br>
INTERN: She is still in shock. She's not under sedation. We gave her
just a simple anti-tetanus. <br>
DOCTOR: Anti-tetanus? <br>
INTERN: Yes. If you care to examine your friend's left hand and
forearm, you will find there's considerable muscular contraction. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. Solid as a rock. <br>
INTERN: Just in the hand and forearm. Perhaps it's a psychological
reaction to stress, and the object to which she was holding on to. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you see it? <br>
INTERN: No. It was sent direct to Doctor Carter in the path lab. Our
concern here is with the living. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Where is the path lab? <br>
INTERN: Just follow the signs saying pathology. <br>
DOCTOR: Will you let me know when she comes round, please? <br>
INTERN: All right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hospital - Path lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CARTER: Histology, that's what you need. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you think of these plate, Doctor? <br>
(X-rays of the mystery hand.) <br>
CARTER: Oh, not much. There's no tissue differentiation. No blood, no
muscle. No indication of any living organism whatsoever. You see, you
usually get some idea of structure from a fossil, but with this there's
nothing. Ah, now look at this. <br>
(Doctor Carter has a slide under a microscope projecting onto a small
screen instead of looking through the eyepiece.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's beautiful. <br>
CARTER: Yes, but it has nothing to do with clinical pathology. <br>
DOCTOR: Does that crystalline lattice remind you of anything? <br>
CARTER: It's geodetic, that's about all. As I say, what you need is a
histologist or a geologist. <br>
DOCTOR: It's silicon based. <br>
CARTER: I'm sorry? <br>
DOCTOR: So how many living forms do you know with a silicon based
molecular infrastructure? <br>
CARTER: None. If it was, it would be made of stone. Oh, I think this is
some kind of elaborate hoax. Always dreaming up something, you know,
students. <br>
DOCTOR: Have we got access to an electron microscope, Doctor? <br>
CARTER: Why, what do you think it is? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know yet, but it's no hoax, Doctor Carter. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hospital - private room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The nameless Doctor takes Sarah's pulse, then
puts her clenched left fist down and leaves. Sarah wakes and opens her
clenched hand to reveal the ring. The stone glows blue briefly, then
she throws back the bedclothes and gets up.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hospital - path lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CARTER: Great Scott. You must have pulled a few
strings to get hold of this. Virology usually hangs on to it like grim
death. What did you tell them? <br>
(The Doctor is wiring up the electron microscope.) <br>
DOCTOR: I said we were investigating certain extraterrestrial
possibilities. <br>
CARTER: Such as? <br>
DOCTOR: Such as viral infection on this planet. <br>
CARTER: You're not serious, are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I admit it's a fairly remote possibility. Viruses can
survive, though not for a hundred and fifty million years as far as we
know. Now this thing was found embedded in a stratum of blackstone
dolomite. <br>
CARTER: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Jurassic limestone. <br>
CARTER: You mean it's been there for a hundred and fifty million years?
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
CARTER: How did it get there? Man didn't exist in Jurassic times. <br>
DOCTOR: That's true. Would you prepare me another slide, please? <br>
CARTER: Oh, sure. <br>
DOCTOR: I think the answer might lie in the quarry. <br>
CARTER: Well, good luck. <br>
(The Doctor leaves. On his way out he passes Sarah's room and turns the
notice to - Patient Not To Be Disturbed, unaware that she is up and
dressed and waiting for the corridor to be empty so she can leave the
room to go to Pathology herself. Carter puts the sample he has drilled
from the Hand into the EM and switches on. Sarah enters behind his
back, picks up the Hand and puts it into a box.) <br>
CARTER: What the devil do you think you're. Miss Smith! Are you feeling
better? <br>
SARAH: Eldrad. Eldrad must live. <br>
(Sarah is wearing the ring with the stone turned in towards her palm.
She holds up her hand and the blue glow envelopes Carter. He falls to
the floor.) <br>
WOMAN [OC]: It is his will that all shall obey. None must interfere. <br>
(Sarah picks up the box containing the Hand and leaves. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quarry]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ABBOTT: Yea, well, this is the stratum it came
from, here. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you find anything else in the rubble? <br>
ABBOTT: If there was anything else, it must've been here a hundred and
fifty million years. We often get ammonite shells and things, but <br>
DOCTOR: Any plastic? <br>
ABBOTT: Plastic? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, plastic. <br>
ABBOTT: You're joking. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Spaceships can be made of plastic, ceramic, metal. <br>
ABBOTT: A spaceship all that time ago? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Lifeforms don't all exist at the same time, you know. <br>
ABBOTT: So you reckon this fellow copped it in a crash, like? <br>
DOCTOR: Unless, of course, it just came fluttering down by itself. But
why? And from where? <br>
ABBOTT: Yeah. Well, I'll let you get on with it then, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. And where was it going? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hospital - path lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Carter picks himself up off the floor, sees the
Hand is missing and goes to the telephone.) <br>
CARTER: Reception? Doctor Carter here. Now listen. The dark haired
young woman wearing some pink-striped overalls. Yes, pink-striped
overalls. Yes, just like Andy Pandy. Well, she's on her way out. She's
stolen something from my lab. Well, hold her, will you, and call the
police. What do you mean, she left an hour ago? Why, it's only just a
few. Good grief. <br>
(The Doctor has returned to the hospital. He knocks quietly at Sarah's
door then looks in to see the bed stripped. He checks the wardrobe and
leaves.) <br>
CARTER: Right. Thank you. <br>
(Carter puts down the phone as the Doctor enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Carter, you haven't seen Miss Smith, have you? <br>
CARTER: Yes, I have! <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Where? <br>
CARTER: Tell me, does she normally go around knocking people out? <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? What do you mean? <br>
CARTER: Well, she was standing over there and when I spoke to her she
turned round, said something like somebody must live, then there was a
flash and I, I don't remember anything else. But she's stolen the hand.
<br>
DOCTOR: What? You mean she hit you? <br>
CARTER: Well, I suppose she must have done. I've been on to reception.
They're looking for her. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. <br>
CARTER: Did you find anything at the quarry? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
CARTER: Did you find anything at the quarry? <br>
(The Doctor sits by Carter's microscope.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, negative evidence. No fragments, which means whatever
it was didn't crash. But we can see from the fracture lines on this
sample there was an explosion. <br>
CARTER: If there was an explosion it was millions of years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and probably millions of miles away. Intriguing, isn't it?
<br>
CARTER: Yes, but it still doesn't explain why your Miss Smith should
want it, does it. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps it wanted Miss Smith. <br>
CARTER: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, she's the only human being to have had any contact with
it for any length of time. Probably the only living organism to have
had any contact with it since the event. <br>
CARTER: It was petrified. Totally inert. Dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Inert, yes, dead, maybe not. <br>
CARTER: I thought there was a strange type of subatomic structure to
the crystal formation. A bit like a double helix, you know. DNA
molecule. <br>
(Carter goes to the EM.) <br>
CARTER: Great Scott! <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
CARTER: It's changed. <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? <br>
CARTER: What's happened to the electron charge? <br>
DOCTOR: You mean it didn't look like that before? <br>
CARTER: No. <br>
DOCTOR: You know what I think? <br>
CARTER: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I think your sample's been quietly absorbing radiation from the
machine. <br>
CARTER: Absorbing radiation? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Regenerating itself. Let's hope it hasn't absorbed enough
to be dangerous. Put it somewhere safe, Carter, away from any further
radiation. <br>
CARTER: Right, will do. <br>
DOCTOR: Carter! <br>
CARTER: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Where's the nearest nuclear reactor? </font></p>

the drive carrying the box containing the Hand. The sign says Nunton
Complex Research and Development No Unauthorised Entry. Sarah zaps the
armed guard with the ring. Meanwhile, Carter is driving the Doctor
there in his own car, in the pouring rain. Sarah walks through the
generator hall to section R1, Radiation Zone and up a metal staircase
to R2. The Doctor and Carter arrive at the main gate just as the guard
wakes up and the Doctor opens the barrier. Then more armed guards
arrive.) <br>
GUARD: Stop or we fire. <br>
(Sarah arrives at section R3, and is seen by a technician.) <br>
TECH: Hey, miss. <br>
(Of course, he gets zapped. Now she is in R4 and goes down a ladder to
Contamination Zone class C. As she starts to open the door to the
radioactive rods area - Radioactive Source Exposed Do Not Enter - the
alarm starts blaring.) <br>
MAN [OC]: Emergency, emergency. All personnel proceed immediately to
your safe areas. Proceed immediately to your safe areas. This is not an

tissue, albeit one based on silicon and therefore with crystalline
qualities to the brown skin. The fingers start to move.) </font></p>

inside a nuclear pile, is hardly likely to be deterred by a few
primitive missiles. <br>
WATSON: But they're the most powerful missiles we have. <br>

your help. <br>

DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
ELDRAD: As a Time Lord, you are pledged to uphold the Laws of Time and
to prevent alien aggression. <br>
DOCTOR: Only when such aggression is deemed to threaten the indigenous
population. I think that's how it goes. <br>
ELDRAD: Then you must help me in my struggle. <br>
SARAH: Why must he help you? You're destructive. <br>
ELDRAD: No, no, let me explain. Kastria was a cold, inhospitable
planet, ravaged by the solar winds. I built the spatial barriers to
keep out those winds. I devised a crystalline silicone form for our
physical needs. I built machines to replenish the earth and the
atmosphere. I brought Kastria to life! And then, two alien planets made
war on each other, and Kastria became their battleground. They
destroyed my barriers. The winds came again to dehydrate the planet.
The alien invaders made puppets of the Kastrian leaders. I was
discredited and sentenced to obliteration. <br>
SARAH: But if you did all those things for your people, why did they
turn against you? <br>
ELDRAD: My people didn't. I beg you to help me to save Kastria once
more. Why do you hesitate? It is your duty. Help me. Take me back
through time. <br>
DOCTOR: That would contravene the First Law of Time, a distortion of
history. I can't do that. <br>
ELDRAD: You cannot refuse. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not refusing, Eldrad. I'll take you back, but it must be in
the present time. <br>
ELDRAD: Silence! <br>
(Watson is outside.) <br>
ELDRAD: I seem to detect another presence in this building. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think there's anyone else here. <br>
SARAH: No, there's no one here. They've all been evacuated. We're the

this paranoid obsession with treachery. You must cooperate. <br>
ELDRAD: Again you leave me no alternative, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be so abject. All we want is your cooperation. If
you've missed those coordinates, symbolic resonance will occur in the

SARAH: Oh, it's horrid. It's so horrible. It was supposed to remake
her. It's destroyed her. <br>
(The slab lifts again, revealing the powdered outline of Eldrad.) <br>
SARAH: We killed her. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Sarah. We've been used. They were determined to get Eldrad
one way or another. <br>
SARAH: Oh, I'm so confused. Oh, what do we do now? <br>
DOCTOR: We leave. <br>
(Another door starts to open so they hide behind the table. A real
Kastrian emerges, looking very crystalline and non-human.) <br>
ELDRAD: (male voice) At last! Doctor? Sarah? It is I, Eldrad. <br>
DOCTOR: Eldrad? <br>
ELDRAD: Of course, you don't recognise me. <br>
DOCTOR: How do we know you're Eldrad? <br>
ELDRAD: Oh come, Doctor, you sound like Professor Watson. As a Time
Lord you should be well acquainted with the processes of regeneration.
I've attained my true form at last. <br>
SARAH: Why is she a he? <br>
ELDRAD: I had to assume a form that would be will be acceptable to the
primitives of your planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. And so you modelled yourself on the first primitive you
came in contact. He modelled himself on you. <br>
SARAH: Oh, thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah thought you'd been obliterated. <br>
ELDRAD: They are fools. I gave them this. I designed it, programmed it
to recognise my cell pattern, and they thought they could use it to
destroy me. Bwahhahaha. It is incapable of destroying me, no matter
what you or they or anyone else might do. I controlled it. And now I
shall control all Kastria, my creation! <br>
DOCTOR: What about your enemies? <br>
ELDRAD: I shall brush them aside, weak and miserable creatures. What
can they do in their decrepitude against the might of Eldrad! <br>
ROKON [OC]: Eldrad. <br>
ELDRAD: Rokon! <br>
(A golden Kastrian is on a large wall screen.) <br>
ROKON [on screen]: Traitor. You think you have victory within your
grasp, but I, Rokon, tell you you have won nothing but defeat. <br>
(The screen goes blank.) <br>
ELDRAD: So, Rokon, you still live. <br>
DOCTOR: Who is Rokon? <br>
ELDRAD: The so-called King of Kastria. It was he who ordered my
obliteration. Me, Eldrad, architect of the barriers! They thought they
could destroy me, so I destroyed the barriers. <br>
DOCTOR: You destroyed the barriers? <br>
ELDRAD: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: So all that business of alien invaders was a lie? <br>
ELDRAD: A necessary lie. A means to an end. <br>
DOCTOR: Why should Rokon want to destroy you in the first place? <br>
ELDRAD: Because he knew I would take his place. I was young and strong,
he was weak and old. He wasn't fit to rule Kastria. And he had no
appetite for conquest. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. But you do. <br>
ELDRAD: Yes. I wanted Kastrians to be masters of the galaxy. And now,
with me at their head, nothing shall stop us! Every planet within range
of our starships shall fall to the power of Eldrad. And now, Doctor, I
have an audience with my king. King? Bwahahaha! <br>
(Eldrad leaves.) <br>
SARAH: We've been taken for a ride. <br>
(The Doctor takes Eldrad's ring from the control console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Dome control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ELDRAD: Rokon. Rokon? You scorn me? <br>
(The robed figure does not move.) <br>
ELDRAD: Your successor? <br>
(Eldrad pulls the robe off. Rokon topples to the floor and crumbles.) <br>
ELDRAD: What is this? You traitor, you've cheated me of my revenge! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the dome control room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SARAH: But we saw him. He spoke. <br>
DOCTOR: A recording from the past. The King obviously knew there was a
chance that Eldrad would return. <br>
ELDRAD [OC]: He robs me of my destiny. <br>
SARAH: The boobytraps? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Dome control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ELDRAD: Nevertheless, I am still King. Nothing can
stop me. My ambition is invincible. <br>
DOCTOR: Where are your subjects, Majesty? <br>
ELDRAD: Subjects? Stored in the race bank. There's a whole new race of
Kastrians, Doctor. A hundred million crystal particles waiting to be
placed in the regenerator. And they shall have me as their ruler! They
will rebuild the barriers. They will restore the cities. They will
replenish the exhausted lands. We will build a new Kastria, and
together we shall go forth and conquer the universe! <br>
SARAH: Let's <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
(Eldrad enters the Race Bank.) <br>
ELDRAD: Nothing! What stupidity is this? Nothing! <br>
ROKON [on screen]: Eldrad! After the premature detonation of the module
we knew there was a remote possibility that one day you would return. <br>
ELDRAD: Yes, I'm here. <br>
ROKON [on screen]: But let me tell you. After you destroyed the
barriers, after we knew for certain that life on the surface was
finished, and the alternative was a miserable subterranean existence,
the Kastrian race chose final oblivion. And, because they feared you
might return to wage eternal war throughout the galaxy, they elected
also to destroy the race banks. <br>
ELDRAD: Traitor! I gave them life! <br>
ROKON [on screen]: So now you are King, as was your wish. I salute you
from the dead. Hail, Eldrad, King of nothing. <br>
ELDRAD: Is this my reward? I created this world. It is mine! Mine by
right! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Rokon seems to have solved the problem for us. A drastic
solution. <br>
SARAH: I wouldn't want to live down here, and I wouldn't want him as a
leader. <br>
ELDRAD: Yes, I shall be King. The Earth people. Very backward and
primitive, but they have the necessary aggression. I shall rule them! I
shall be their god! And you will take me back! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. That's not in the contract. A one-way ticket only. My
obligation to you is over. You're in your own world now. <br>
ELDRAD: You have my ring. Give it to me. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. <br>
ELDRAD: It is my key to eternity. Give me the ring! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, since you've put it so nicely. <br>
SARAH: Don't. <br>
DOCTOR: Here. Catch. <br>
(The Doctor throws the ring across the room, into the Race Bank.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Sarah. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Down there. Get down there. <br>
SARAH: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Hold this. <br>
(The end of his scarf.) <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
ELDRAD: There is no escape. <br>
SARAH: What do I do? <br>
DOCTOR: When I say pull, you pull. <br>
(They set up a trip wire.) <br>
ELDRAD: You will take me back! <br>
DOCTOR: Pull! <br>
(Eldrad is tripped up, and falls into the abyss.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the gravity of the law finally caught up with him. <br>
SARAH: Yeah, that's all very well, but that was a bit rash, giving him
his ring back. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(The Doctor takes the ring from his pocket.) <br>
SARAH: Oh. Well, what did you give him back, then? <br>
DOCTOR: My magician's stick. <br>

DOCTOR: No, we're well out of that. Goodbye, Kastria. <br>

SARAH: Do you think that Eldrad, well, do you think that he really is
dead? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I doubt it. Very difficult to kill. <br>
SARAH: Well, I quite liked her, but I couldn't stand him. <br>
(The Tardis tilts.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy, old girl, easy. These temperatures must have
affected the thermo-couplings. <br>
SARAH: Yes, I know how she feels. I think Kastria must be the coldest
planet in the galaxy. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish. I've been to much colder places. <br>
SARAH: Oh, big deal. It's all right for you. I'm human. We're not so
thick-skinned. <br>

DOCTOR: Where's that astro-rectifier? What did you say? <br>
SARAH: Thick-skinned. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good, good. <br>
SARAH: Here. <br>
DOCTOR: Multi-quantiscope. <br>
SARAH: You know, I might as well be talking to the moon. You don't even
listen to me. <br>
DOCTOR: Mergin nut. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, forget the mergin nut. I'll have the ganymede driver. <br>
SARAH: There. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
SARAH: Oh, I must be mad. I'm sick of being cold and wet, and
hypnotised left right and centre. I'm sick of being shot at, savaged by
bug-eyed monsters, never knowing if I'm coming or going or been. <br>
DOCTOR: Zeus plug. <br>
SARAH: Oh, I want a bath. I want my hair washed. I just want to feel
human again. <br>
DOCTOR: Forget the zeus plug. I'll have the sonic screwdriver. <br>
SARAH: Oh, and boy am I sick of that sonic screwdriver! I'm going to
pack my goodies and I'm going home. I said, I'm going to pack my
goodies and I am going home! Right! Excuse me! <br>
(Sarah storms out of the console room.) <br>
DOCTOR: What was that you? I don't know why she goes on like this.
There's really nothing the matter at all. <br>
(The Doctor gets a mental wave.) <br>
DOCTOR: The call. The call from Gallifrey. Gallifrey. After all this
time, Gallifrey. I can't take Sarah to Gallifrey. Must get her back
home. Must reset the coordinates. South Croydon. <br>
(Sarah enters carrying a bag and a pile of stuff including a plant in a
pot, a stuffed toy owl and a tennis racquet.) <br>
SARAH: Ahem! <br>
DOCTOR: You're a good girl, Sarah. <br>
SARAH: Oh, look, it's too late apologising now. Everything's packed.
I've got to go. <br>
DOCTOR: What? How did you know? <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I've had the call from Gallifrey. <br>
SARAH: So? <br>
DOCTOR: So I can't take you with me. You've got to go. <br>
SARAH: Oh, come on. I can't miss Gallifrey. Look, I was only joking. I
didn't mean it. Hey. Hey, you're not going to regenerate again, are
you? <br>
DOCTOR: Not this time. I don't know what's going to happen. <br>
SARAH: You're playing one of your jokes on me, just trying to make me
stay. <br>
DOCTOR: No. I've received the call, and as a Time Lord I must obey. <br>
SARAH: Alone? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(The Tardis materialises.) <br>
SARAH: And I'll give your love to Harry and the Brigadier. Oh, and I
can tell Professor Watson that you're all right. <br>
DOCTOR: We've landed, Sarah. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: We've landed. <br>
SARAH: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: South Croydon. Hillview Road, to be exact. <br>
SARAH: That's my home. Well, I'll be off then. Here. <br>
(She gives him his coat back.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thanks. <br>
SARAH: Don't forget me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Sarah. Don't you forget me. <br>
