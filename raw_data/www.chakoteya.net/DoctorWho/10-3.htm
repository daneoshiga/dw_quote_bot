star systems. One of its crew reports back to base.) <br>
HARDY: This is Earth cargo ship C982 on course and on schedule. We
shall be entering hyperspace in fifty seconds. <br>
STEWART: Do you know what I'd like? <br>
HARDY: What? <br>
STEWART: A job on one of those luxury space liners. First Officer on
the Mars Venus cruise, that'd suit me. <br>
HARDY: You can keep it. Spit and polish, cocktail parties and all those
passengers? <br>
STEWART: Gold braid uniform, beautiful stewardesses? Yeah, I'd take
that any time. <br>
HARDY: You'll more likely wind up pushing a battle cruiser. <br>
STEWART: There's not going to be an interplanetary war. <br>
HARDY: Didn't you see the videocast last night? The President of
Earth's government deplores the Draconian attack on two of Earth's
cargo vessels. <br>
STEWART: Look, they steal a few of our cargoes, we steal a few of
theirs. It'll all blow over. Right, we're ready for the jump. <br>
(Stewart straps himself in.) <br>
HARDY: Preparing to enter hyperspace at twenty two oh nine seventy two,
two thousand, five hundred and forty EST. Right. <br>
STEWART: Right. <br>
(The spaceship hurtles forward. A little while later...) <br>
HARDY: Hey look, a ship. <br>
STEWART: That thing's not a ship! <br>
(No, it's a materialising Tardis on the main monitor.) <br>
HARDY: It's going to hit us! <br>
STEWART: Pulling out of hyperspace now at twenty two thirteen seven two
seven two four zero! <br>
STEWART: Phew! That was a close thing. <br>
(The engine noise stops and the Tardis disappears from the monitor.) <br>
HARDY: It vanished. It just vanished. <br>
STEWART: You'd better report it. <br>
HARDY: Mysterious object sighted during hyperspace transition. Object
resembled large box with flashing light on top. Object disappeared
before collision. Present whereabouts unknown.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis has materialised in an open area with
a short flight of steps out to a passageway. Jo comes storming out.) <br>
JO: Well, I'm never going in that thing again. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Jo, be reasonable. <br>
JO: Only you could manage to have a traffic accident in space. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we didn't hit it, did we? <br>
JO: Didn't we? Where's this then? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, by a rather brilliant last minute course correction, I've
managed to materialise the Tardis inside the spaceship. But to avoid
hitting it, I've had to make a random jump back into normal space. <br>
JO: Terrific, but what do we do now? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if I'm going to get us back to Earth, I'd better find out
where we are. I'll just go and check the instruments. <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis. Jo reads the labels on the large
hoppers around the hold.) <br>
JO: Hmm, they're carrying bulk flour. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: What? <br>
JO: They're carrying a cargo of bulk flour. <br>
(She walks over to a porthole and sees another spaceship nearby. There
is a sudden blinding flash accompanied by a piercing noise. A different
spaceship is now there.) <br>
JO: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Well, I think I know where we are. <br>
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis, writing in his notebook.) <br>
DOCTOR: And I've got a pretty good idea about when. <br>
JO: Come and take a look at this. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at what? <br>
JO: That. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's just a space ship, Jo. You know, I reckon we must be
somewhere in the twenty sixth century. Well, interstellar travel's
pretty routine by now. <br>
JO: A moment ago, it seemed to change shape. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm? <br>
JO: It was when I heard that noise. Didn't you hear it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I did hear something, but very faintly. Come on, Jo.
Let's go and find the crew. I want to find the exact date for my
calculations. <br>
JO: Doctor, it's coming straight at us! <br>
DOCTOR: What?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HARDY: You won't believe this. <br>
STEWART: Now what? <br>
HARDY: Maybe it's a wreck. <br>
STEWART: Try and make contact. They may need help. <br>
HARDY: This is earth cargo ship C982 in close proximity to you. Do you
read me? Do you read me? <br>
STEWART: Try again. <br>
HARDY: Do you read me? Are you in need of assistance? <br>
(Only static.) <br>
HARDY: It's a weird looking crate. <br>
(The noise comes again, and the flash, and the spaceship changes
shape.) <br>
HARDY: Draconians! <br>
STEWART: This close to Earth? <br>
HARDY: They're going to attack us! <br>
STEWART: Get the blasters. <br>
HARDY: You can't take on a battle cruiser. <br>
STEWART: Get the blasters! Emergency, emergency, red alert. This is
Earth cargo ship C982 on coordinate eight nine seven two stroke six
four eight three. We are under attack by a Draconian battle cruiser,
galaxy class, equipped with neutronic missiles. Emergency, emergency! <br>

locker.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Well, that's interesting. They must be
going to do a link up. <br>
JO: What for? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the two ships are joined together by a sort of tunnel,
you see, with two airlocks. Well, then they equalise the pressure
allowing the crew to move from one ship to the other without using
spacesuits. Well, otherwise they'd have to get all kitted up and do a
space walk. <br>
JO: Fascinating, but let's get back to the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, Jo, don't worry. We'll be on our way soon. Now let's go
and take look at the ship's calendar. <br>

the locker. The Doctor walks round the corner.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, how do you do? I'm sorry about this intrusion. <br>
HARDY: Who are you? <br>
(The weird noise comes, and to Hardy's eyes the Doctor changes into a
scaly humanoid with a high conical head.) <br>
DOCTOR: I said, how do you do? <br>
HARDY: Dragons! Drop that gun. <br>
DOCTOR: Gun? I haven't got a gun. This is simply my hand. <br>
(Jo enters.) <br>
JO: Doctor. No! <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, what's the matter with you? <br>
JO: It's a Drashig! <br>
(Because that is what the noise makes her see.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense, it's simply a man with a gun. Now pull yourself
together.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEWART: This is Earth cargo ship C982. Situation
red alert. Draconian battle cruiser is now about to grapple. They are
going to lock on now. Repeat, Draconian battle cruiser about to lock on
now. All anti-boarding procedures carried out. Awaiting instructions.
Out. <br>
(The two ships dock. A Draconian with a forked beard appears on the
monitor.) <br>
PILOT [on monitor]: This is the commander of the Draconian battle
cruiser. We are locked onto your vessel and are about to board. If you
offer any resistance, you will be destroyed. Open the hatch of your
airlock. <br>
(The Doctor and Jo are brought in by Hardy.) <br>
HARDY: Move! <br>
HARDY: I found these two Dragons in the hold. <br>
STEWART: But that's impossible. They're only just locking on. <br>
JO: Doctor, what's happening? What's going on? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not sure, Jo. Something rather intriguing. <br>
PILOT [on monitor]: If you resist, we can destroy you with our
neutronic weapons. <br>
STEWART: If you destroy our ship, you won't get the cargo. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, so that's what it's all about. <br>
PILOT [on monitor]: Open the hatch to your airlock or we shall enter
your ship by force. <br>
STEWART: We refuse. <br>
HARDY: They can blow us to pieces! <br>
STEWART: I've sent a message to Earth asking for help. <br>
HARDY: Tell them about the prisoners. <br>
STEWART: We have captured two of your soldiers. They will not survive
if you enter our ship. Lock them in the hold. <br>
HARDY: Move! Get moving! <br>
STEWART: Emergency, emergency. Red alert. This is cargo ship C982 on
coordinate eight nine seven two stroke six four eight three. Draconian
battle cruiser has now locked on. They are about to force entry.

Earth. We are shown a pair of skyscrapers with a low long building in
front which has one dome and one upturned dish on it. The whole complex
is set in a lush green landscape. It is the Congresso Nacional do
Brasil, in Brasilia. A Draconian in a green robe stands aloof while a
woman in an orange dress talks to him.) <br>
PRESIDENT: But all these charges are false, your Highness. We are not
attacking Draconian ships. We never have. <br>
PRINCE: Our soldiers have seen the Earthmen attack us. Our cargoes have
been stolen. We are Draconians. We do not lie. <br>
PRESIDENT: The honour of your race is well known, your Highness. That
is why I cannot understand your actions. <br>
PRINCE: Actions? <br>
PRESIDENT: You attack our ships, you steal their cargoes, you ignore
our protests and just meet them with these counter charges. <br>
PRINCE: Our charges are true but yours are false. We do not attack your
ships. <br>
PRESIDENT: This is a transcript of a distress call from one of our
ships. From Earth's cargo ship number C982 on coordinate eight nine
seven two, six four eight three. We are under attack by a Draconian
battle cruiser, galaxy class, equipped with neutronic missiles. <br>
PRINCE: The treaty between our two empires established a frontier in
space. We have never violated that frontier. You have invaded our part
of the galaxy many times. <br>
(A shadowy figure in the corner turns round.) <br>
WILLIAMS: In pursuit of your ships when they have raided ours! We've
been very patient. perhaps too patient. <br>
PRESIDENT: General Williams! I take it a rescue attempt has been
mounted? <br>
WILLIAMS: We've established an automatic procedure because of the
frequency of these attacks. <br>
PRESIDENT: Then I suggest you go and supervise the matter. <br>
WILLIAMS: There's no need. <br>
PRESIDENT: Please do as I say. <br>
WILLIAMS: As you wish, Madam President. <br>
(Williams leaves.) <br>
PRINCE: Your General is insolent. We know the hatred he has always felt
for our people. Long ago he caused war. Now he wishes to do so again. <br>
PRESIDENT: He's a soldier, your Highness, and he's angry. The people of
Earth are angry. <br>
PRINCE: So are the nobles of my father's court! <br>
PRESIDENT: I must ask you to take my personal appeal to your father,
the Emperor. He must put a stop to these attacks. If Draconia has some
grievances against Earth, then this is not the way to deal with them. <br>
PRINCE: Many of our noblemen felt it was a mistake to make a treaty
with the Earthmen. Perhaps they were right. You attack our ships and
when we protest, you trick us with lies and evasions. I give you a
final warning. The path you are treading leads only to war. And in that
war, Draconia will destroy you!

DOCTOR: Look <br>
HARDY: In there. <br>
(Hardy bolts the Doctor and Jo into a small metal-lined room.) <br>
JO: Doctor, what's happening on this ship? Are they both mad or am I?
First I see a Drashig and <br>
(The Doctor takes out his sonic screwdriver.) <br>
JO: No, you can put that away. Bolts. And why do they keep calling us
Dragons? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's the way they see us, I suppose. <br>
JO: Yes, but why Dragons? <br>
DOCTOR: It's got to be some non-human life form. Something that they're
frightened of. Dragons. Dragons. Yes, of course, Draconians. <br>
JO: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if this is the period that I think it is, there are two
great empires spreading their way through the galaxy of the Milky Way. <br>
JO: Empires? You mean like Solos? <br>
DOCTOR: Those were the declining years of Earth's planetary empire.
This is just the beginning. Now Earth and Draconia are both been
expanding, you see. Colonising one planet after another, and they're
sitting on a powder keg. <br>
JO: Yes, but why do they mistake us for these Dragons? <br>
DOCTOR: No, Draconians. No, Dragons is rather an unflattering nickname.
Well, you remember that sound you heard? <br>
JO: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And the man that you saw with the gun? <br>
JO: Oh, no. No, no, what I saw was a Drashig! <br>
DOCTOR: No, you didn't, Jo. That sound made you see what you fear most.
<br>
JO: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it shouldn't be too difficult. Ultrasonics geared to
stimulate the fear centres of the brain, something like that. <br>
JO: How long does it last? How long before they see that we're just
people? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, difficult to say. It seems to act like a sort of
post-hypnotic command. It'll fade eventually, of course. <br>
JO: Why should anybody go to all this trouble to make people see
things? <br>
DOCTOR: Why indeed. <br>
JO: Well, we've got to get out of here somehow. <br>
(Jo looks through a grill section of the door.) <br>
JO: Doctor! I can see the Tardis! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's one consolation, isn't it?

(Interference comes back over the speaker.) <br>
HARDY: Ah, they're jamming us. <br>
STEWART: Well, maybe the first message got through. They'll send help. <br>
HARDY: Will they? They're probably still passing memos to each other. <br>
STEWART: They'll send help. <br>
HARDY: I know what they'll do. They'll send an urgent protest to the
Draconian Embassy. By that time, we'll be finished. The government
should have blown the buggers out of space years ago. <br>
STEWART: And have another war? <br>
HARDY: What do you think this is? <br>
STEWART: Look, the door of our space lock is ninety nine percent
durilium. They're not going to get through that in a hurry. <br>
PILOT [on monitor]: Earth men, this is your last warning. Surrender
your cargo and you will be unharmed. Resist and you will be destroyed. <br>
STEWART: Right. Looks like battle stations. We'd better get down to the
airlock. <br>
HARDY: You're not going to fight them? <br>
STEWART: If I have to. Do you have a better idea? <br>
HARDY: It's only a load of flour! <br>
STEWART: It's my cargo. And if the Draconians want it, it's going to
cost them more than just a few threats.

today that the recently reclaimed Arctic areas are now ready for
habitation. As a special inducement for those willing to live in New
Glasgow and New Montreal, the first two totally enclosed cities to be
opened, the family allowance will be increased to two children per
couple. News is just coming through of another Draconian attack on an
Earth cargo ship in space. This is the third attack on an Earth cargo
ship this month. In a statement issued by the Draconian Embassy on
Earth, the Draconian government denies all knowledge of this or any
other attacks. <br>
(Williams enters.) <br>
NEWSMAN [on screen]: As yet there has been no official comment, but
Congressman Brook, Leader of the Opposition has said, the people of
Earth will no longer tolerate these unprovoked attacks. It is time for
the World Government to take a stand and issue a final ultimatum to the
Draconian Emperor. <br>
(The President turns off the screen.) <br>
PRESIDENT: I thought I ordered a complete security blackout. <br>
WILLIAMS: The news services have their own monitors. They probably
picked up the distress messages. <br>
PRESIDENT: And? <br>
WILLIAMS: The rescue ships should rendezvous in seventeen and a half
minutes from now. It'll be too late, of course. All they'll find will
be dead men and a gutted ship.

WILLIAMS: I want more than that. This is a military situation. We
should attack now. <br>
PRESIDENT: No! I will not be responsible for starting a war! <br>
WILLIAMS: There is one thing worse than war, Madam President, and that
is defeat. You must think of your own position. <br>
PRESIDENT: What about my position?&nbsp;<br>
WILLIAMS: If you're not seen to act decisively against the Draconians,
you can, and will, be replaced. <br>
PRESIDENT: By you, perhaps? <br>
WILLIAMS: We used to be friends once. I know what's happened has
changed all that, but do you really think I'd betray you? <br>
PRESIDENT: No. No, I've never doubted you. I'm sorry. <br>
WILLIAMS: There are certain senior officers who feel that a military
dictatorship is needed. Your political opponents are clamouring for
war. You must act now or they will bring you down. <br>
PRESIDENT: I shall break off diplomatic relations. The Draconian
Ambassador and his staff will be expelled from this planet. I shall
inform the Emperor that his actions will no longer be tolerated. But
unless you give me conclusive evidence about their intentions, I shall
not strike the first blow. <br>
WILLIAMS: The proof you need is in the minds of those two traitors. We
shall have to use the mind probe. <br>
PRESIDENT: Not on the girl. Perhaps I can make her see reason. <br>

Who are you fighting tonight? What happened to you, anyway? <br>
JO: Oh, they kept going on at me to confess. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, awkward, isn't it? Well, they've made up their minds, you
see. They'll only believe us if we tell them what they want to hear.
It's a pity really that the Ogrons didn't succeed in kidnapping us.
Perhaps we should have been more helpful. <br>
JO: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if they had succeeded, presumably they'd have taken us to
where the Tardis is. I'm sorry, Jo. I'm afraid another kidnapping

CROSS: Maybe another prisoner did it? You know, one who had it in for
them? <br>
GOVERNOR: You are both guilty of attempting to escape. You'll both be
placed in solitary confinement for the next year. <br>
MASTER: Er, just a moment, Governor. Do what you will with the old man
but that one comes with me. <br>
GOVERNOR: Out of the question, I'm afraid. He's committed an internal
offence and is subject to prison discipline. Take them away. <br>

CROSS: Sorry about this, sir. I'll see it doesn't happen again. <br>
GOVERNOR: Yes, it had better not. All right, you can go. <br>
CROSS: Sir. <br>
(Cross leaves.) <br>
MASTER: You know, I do wish that you'd reconsider, Governor. Obtaining
custody of that prisoner is very important to me. And I do have a
warrant. <br>
GOVERNOR: It's out of the question, I'm afraid. You see, he's under
punishment. When he's completed his solitary confinement, I'll
reconsider. <br>
MASTER: I see. You know, I have a theory about this incident. <br>
GOVERNOR: It's no concern of yours. <br>
MASTER: I think that those two prisoners were telling the truth. I
think that your trusty, Cross, was helping them. <br>
GOVERNOR: Why should he do that? <br>
MASTER: On your instructions. <br>
GOVERNOR: That is an outrageous suggest <br>
MASTER: Oh come, Governor. You rid yourself of a politically dangerous
prisoner, and foster the legend that escape is impossible in one go. I
must congratulate you. <br>
GOVERNOR: You're being very impermanent. <br>
MASTER: Suppose I were to support the Doctor's demand for an official
enquiry? Some very awkward questions could be asked. <br>
GOVERNOR: I have nothing to fear. <br>
MASTER: Haven't you? Oh, come, Governor. Hand the Doctor over to me and
I promise you he'll be no further trouble to you. <br>
GOVERNOR: Well, I've no wish to be uncooperative. What would you do
with him? <br>

wouldn't believe the list of crimes he's committed.

GOVERNOR: I'm releasing you into the custody of this Commissioner. He
will fly you back to Sirius 4 to stand trial. <br>
DOCTOR: And may I ask what I'm supposed to have done there? <br>
MASTER: Defrauding the Sirius 4 Dominion Bank, evasion of planetary
income tax. Assault and battery committed upon the person of a Sirius 4
police official. Taking a spaceship without authority and piloting the
said spaceship without payment of tax and insurance. Landing the said
spaceship on an unauthorised area of Sirius 3. Need I go on? <br>
DOCTOR: I seem to be quite the master criminal, don't I? You don't mean
to say that you really believe all this nonsense, do you, Governor?
Whatever credentials that he's shown you are forged. <br>

MASTER: Miss Grant, please. I employ them. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well whatever it is you're up to, you needn't expect any
help from me. <br>
MASTER: I don't need any help. Your simple presence will be quite
enough. Oh, by the way, I need hardly warn you there is no point in
trying to escape. This is an interplanetary police spaceship, specially
built for carrying prisoners, as you can see. <br>
DOCTOR: Stolen, of course? <br>
MASTER: Of course. Oh, and another thing. There's a closed circuit
television camera trained on you from up there, so you will be under
continuous observation. I think that's all. Well now, if you'll excuse
me, I have some rather complicated astro-navigational calculations to
work out. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, may I ask where we're going? <br>
MASTER: Certainly. To the home of our friends, the Ogrons. A barren and
uninteresting planet on the remote fringes of the galaxy. <br>
JO: Why are you taking us there? <br>
MASTER: That, Miss Grant, you will discover when you arrive. <br>

DOCTOR: Right, now listen to me. We haven't got much time before he
gets back to the flight deck. Now, the first thing we've got to do is
to escape. Now they took my sonic screwdriver from me in the prison,
but they didn't get a hold of this. <br>
(The Doctor takes a piece of wire from his boot.) <br>
DOCTOR: A steel file. <br>
JO: Right, let's go. <br>
DOCTOR: No, not yet. Let's wait until he gets back to the flight deck,
then he'll set the controls. Now, this is an automatic spaceship. Once
we're underway, the computers take over, right? <br>
JO: Okay, so what's the plan? <br>

attacking them. <br>

of the Earthmen to lull us into false security. <br>

land in the palace spaceport. They say they're on a special mission
from the President of Earth. <br>

DOCTOR: A wise decision, your Majesty. For only by Earth and Draconia
working together can we hope to arrive at the truth. <br>
MASTER: I too welcome your wisdom, your Majesty. Nobody could be more
devoted to the cause of peace than I. As a commissioner of Earth's
Interplanetary Police, I have devoted my life to the cause of law and
order. And law and order can only exist in a time of peace. <br>

adequately deal with criminals such as this man and this unfortunate
girl. <br>
JO: Doctor, listen! That sound! <br>
PRINCE: Silence, female! <br>
JO: Quiet! It's the same noise that I heard on the cargo ship. Doctor,
it's the Ogrons! <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty, I beg of you to be cautious. Something is
seriously wrong here. This ship that has just landed. I beg you, place
it under guard immediately. <br>

DOCTOR: Your Majesty, look down here and tell me. What do you see? <br>
(The noise is still audible.) <br>
EMPEROR: I see one of your Earth soldiers who attacked my palace and
killed my people. <br>
DOCTOR: Jo? Jo, can you still hear that sound? <br>

coordinates two three four nine, six seven eight four. <br>
WILLIAMS: You realise where that will take us? A completely uninhabited
sector of the galaxy. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, not completely uninhabited, General Williams. That's
where the Ogron's planet is. <br>
WILLIAMS: No doubt your information is better than mine. May I ask
where you obtained it? <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly. From the Master. He fed the coordinates into his
ship's computer when I was his prisoner. And after you'd captured the
ship, sir, I extracted the information from the ship's memory banks. <br>

malfunctioning. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know exactly what's wrong? <br>
PILOT: There's damage to exterior electrical circuit. <br>
WILLIAMS: Can't you repair it? <br>
PILOT: It'll mean going outside, sir. <br>
WILLIAMS: Put the ship on automatic and get out there. <br>
PILOT: No good, sir. I've got to control it manually. <br>

spaceship, this time with the flying harness wires clearly visible, so
we can say he is on a lifeline. He unlocks a panel cover and gets to
