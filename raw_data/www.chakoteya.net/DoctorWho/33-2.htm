<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor rushes to the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Bye, then. Lovely meeting you. Sorry about the mess. <br>
(He is restrained by an elegant woman in a sheer gown and tall blue
headdress, who pushes him up against the Tardis door and strokes his
hair.) <br>
NEFERTITI: You think I'll just let you leave without me, after what
we've just been through?<br>
(She looks remarkably like her limestone bust.) <br>
DOCTOR: You've got the Egyptian people to rule, Queen Nefertiti.
They'll need reassuring after that weapon-bearing giant alien locust
attack we just stopped rather brilliantly. <br>
(Something parps, making her jump and him escape from her embrace. It
is his mobile phone text alert.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear, sorry. I've got it set to Temporal News For You.
That's interesting. <br>
NEFERTITI: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Not interesting. Not at all. Ooo, never been there.
Exciting! I'm off! <br>
(They go inside the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Coming! <br>
(The Tardis zooms upwards.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> INDIRA: Craft size approximately ten million
square kilometres. <br>
DOCTOR: A ship the size of Canada coming at Earth very fast. Any signs
of life? <br>
INDIRA: We sent up a drone craft. It took these readings. <br>
(Nefertiti is there, too. The incoming spaceship is a central mass with
lots of big pods extending out of it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Crikey, Charlie, look at that. Ooo, I know someone who'd love
to have a look at that. And the Ponds. Mustn't forget the Ponds, Neffy.
Haven't seen them in ages. I'm riffing. People usually stop me when I'm
riffing or carry on without me. That's also an option. <br>
NEFERTITI: Can you communicate with this craft? <br>
DOCTOR: She's with me. Good question, Neffy. <br>
INDIRA: No. No response on any channel, in any recognised language. If
it comes within ten thousand kilometres of Earth, we send up missiles. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Indira, I liked you before you said missiles. How long till
the ship gets that close? <br>
INDIRA: Six hours nineteen minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Better get a shift on, then. Leave it with us. Come on,
Neffy. We're going to need help. </font></p>

DOCTOR: More stew? <br>
RIDDELL: Where've you been, man? Seven months. You said you were
popping out for some liquorice. I had two very disappointed dancers on
my hands. Not that I couldn't manage. <br>
DOCTOR: Riddell, listen. I've found, well, something. <br>
RIDDELL: No, no, no, no, no. I shan't fall for that again. What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: I've no idea. Do you want to find out? </font></p>

Rory and Amy, seeing to a ceiling light fitting.) <br>
BRIAN: I think it's the fitting. <br>
RORY: Dad, it's not the fitting. It just needs a new bulb. <br>
BRIAN: You're wobbling the ladder. <br>
RORY: I'm not. I don't want another loft incident. <br>
AMY: How's my side, Brian? <br>
BRIAN: Perfect, as ever, Amy. <br>
AMY: Thank you, Brian. <br>
BRIAN: I don't know what he said to you to make you marry him, but he's
a lucky man. <br>
(The sound of an arriving Tardis, and papers blowing.) <br>
RORY: (sotto) Not here, not now. <br>
BRIAN: You leave the back door open? <br>
RORY: What is he doing? <br>
AMY: I'm going to kill him. <br>
(The Tardis materialises around them.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Hello! You weren't busy, were you? Well,
even if you were, it wasn't as interesting as this probably is. Didn't
want you to miss it. Now, just a quick hop. <br>
(The Tardis zooms to the impossibly large spaceship. Brian is still
standing on the stepladder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Everybody grab a torch. <br>
(Brian drops the light bulb.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Open area]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Dark and dusty, with cobwebs. No obvious
indication of usage, the whole place is just big open-plan.) <br>
DOCTOR: Spiders. Don't normally get spiders in space. <br>
(Brian is last out of the Tardis.) <br>
BRIAN: What the? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't move! Do you really think I'm that stupid I wouldn't
notice? How did you get aboard, eh? Transmat? Who sent you? <br>
RORY: Doctor. That's my dad. <br>
DOCTOR: Well frankly, that's outrageous. <br>
RORY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You think you can just bring your dad along without asking? I'm
not a taxi service, you know. <br>
RORY: You materialised around us. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, that's fine, then. My mistake. Hello, Brian. How are
you? Nice to meet you. Welcome, welcome. This is the gang. I've got a
gang. Yes. Come on then, everyone. <br>
AMY: Tell him something, quick. <br>
RORY: Yes, thank you! <br>
BRIAN: I'm not entirely sure what's going on. <br>
RORY: You know when Amy and I first got married and we went travelling <br>
BRIAN: To Thailand. <br>
RORY: More the entirety of space and time. In that police box. <br>
(Something shakes the spaceship.) <br>
AMY: All right, where are we? What is that noise and hello, ten months?
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I sense it's orbiting. More like pre-crashing. On a
spaceship, don't know, and hello, Pond. Ten months. Time flies. Never
really understood that phrase. This is Neffy, this is Riddell. They're
with me. <br>
RIDDELL: Charmed. <br>
AMY: With you? They're with you? Are they the new us? Is that why we
haven't seen you? <br>
DOCTOR: No. They're just people. They're not Ponds. I thought we might
need a new gang. Not really had a gang before. It's new. <br>
(At the far end of this hold is a big bulkhead door. Red lights come on
either side of it.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's coming down. <br>
RIDDELL: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: No idea. <br>
(It is a cargo lift, and it arrives with a thump. The doors open to
reveal two large armoured creatures backlight by a very bright light.) <br>
BRIAN: Not possible. <br>
DOCTOR: Run! <br>
(The gang run away, except the Doctor.) <br>
AMY: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! <br>
(Amy grabs the Doctor and pulls him away from the ankylosaurs.) <br>
NEFERTITI: In here! <br>
(They hide in a sort of alcove. The annoyed armoured beasts stop
nearby. Riddell gets out a knife.) <br>
RIDDELL: I could take one of them. Short blow up into the throat. <br>
DOCTOR: Or not. We've just found dinosaurs in space. We need to
preserve them. <br>
RIDDELL: Who's going to preserve us? <br>
AMY: Shush. <br>
(The ankylosaurs move on.) <br>
RORY: Okay, so, how and whose ship? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A display has the gang on it, with the warning
Intruders Detected.) <br>
DOCTOR: [on screen]: Well, there's so much to discover. Think how wise
we'll be by the end of all this. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Open area]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIAN: Sorry, sorry. Are you saying dinosaurs are
flying a spaceship? <br>
DOCTOR: Brian, please, that would be ridiculous. They're probably just
passengers. Did I mention missiles? <br>
BRIAN: Missiles? <br>
DOCTOR: Didn't want to worry you. Anyway, six hours is a lifetime. Not
literally a lifetime. That's what we're trying to avoid. And we're all
really clever. Ooo, let's see what we can find out. Come on. <br>
(The Doctor removes a cobweb from a blank monitor. Amy examines gouges
in the walls.) <br>
AMY: How many dinosaurs do you think are on here? <br>
(The Doctor sonics the monitor into life.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, whoever you are. Looking for engines. Thank you,
computer. Look at that. Different sections have engines, but these look
like the primary clusters. Where are we now, computer? We need to get
down to these engines. <br>
(The Doctor, Brian and Rory are teleported away.) <br>
NEFERTITI: What happened? <br>
AMY: Oh, great. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Cleverly disguised as a beach in cold weather
with a fair old wind blowing. Who wrote this, Douglas Adams?) <br>
DOCTOR: Find out. What? <br>
BRIAN: We're outside. We're on a beach. <br>
DOCTOR: Teleport. Oh, I hate teleports. Must have activated on my
voice. <br>
BRIAN: Ah, yes, well, thank you, Arthur C Clarke. Teleport, obviously.
I mean, we're on a spaceship with dinosaurs. Why wouldn't there be a
teleport? In fact, why don't we just teleport now? <br>
DOCTOR: Is he all right? <br>
RORY: No, he hates travelling. Makes him really anxious. He only goes
to the paper shop and golf. <br>
DOCTOR: What did you bring him for? <br>
RORY: I didn't! Why can't you just phone ahead like any normal person? <br>
BRIAN: Somebody tell me where we are, now. <br>
(The Doctor tastes the air.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's not Earth. Doesn't taste right. Too metallic. <br>
BRIAN: Is that a kestrel? <br>
DOCTOR: I do hope so. <br>
RORY: The beach is humming. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it? Oh yes. Right, well, don't just stand there, you two.
Dig. I'm going to look at rocks. Love a rock. <br>
RORY: Dig with what? <br>
BRIAN: Ah, well. <br>
(Brian produces a trowel and starts digging in the sand.) <br>
RORY: Did you just have that on you? <br>
BRIAN: Of course. What sort of man doesn't carry a trowel? Put it on
your Christmas list. <br>
RORY: Dad, I'm thirty one. I don't have a Christmas list any more. <br>
DOCTOR: I do! <br>
(Brian reaches metal.) <br>
BRIAN: There's a floor under this beach. </font></p>

tech from where the Doctor and his gang are.) <br>

After all this time. Bring them to me. <br>

RIDDELL: There's clearly more than just two of these creatures. <br>
(He takes a pull from his hip flask.) <br>
AMY: Hey, put that away. I need you sober. <br>
RIDDELL: It's medicinal. And I don't take orders from females. <br>
NEFERTITI: Then learn. Any man who speaks to me that way, I execute. <br>
RIDDELL: You're very welcome to try. <br>
AMY: Sorry, what was your name again? <br>
NEFERTITI: Lady of the Two Lands, wife of the great King Amenhotep,
Queen Nefertiti of Egypt. <br>
RIDDELL: I'll be damned. <br>
AMY: Oh, my god. Queen Nefertiti? I learned all about you at school.
You're awesome. Big fan. High five. Yeah, bit behind on that. You're
really famous. <br>
RIDDELL: Shush. Listen. <br>
(Something is breathing heavily nearby. Very nearby. They are standing
next to a six foot long carnivore lying on its side. There are eggs
nearby.) <br>
AMY: Okay. At a guess, T Rex, not yet full size. We're in the middle of
a dinosaur nest. <br>
RIDDELL: I propose a retreat. <br>
(An ominious shadow on the wall.) <br>
RIDDELL: Perhaps forwards. <br>
AMY: Agreed. Just don't wake the baby. <br>
(Riddell has to step over it.) <br>
AMY: Oh, my god. Who are you, anyway? <br>
RIDDELL: John Riddell, big game hunter on the African plains. I'm sure
you've heard of me, too. <br>
AMY: No. <br>
RIDDELL: You clearly have some alarming gaps in your education. <br>
AMY: Or men who hunt defenceless creatures just don't impact on
history. Face it, she's way cooler than you. <br>
NEFERTITI: And you, Amy. Are you also a Queen? <br>
AMY: Yes. Yes, I am. </font></p>

point in the nearby cliff face.) <br>
DOCTOR: See? Metal floors, screens in rocks. It was just a matter of a
short range teleport. We're still on the ship. <br>
BRIAN: No, we're outside on a beach. <br>
RORY: It's part of the ship, Dad. <br>
BRIAN: Don't be ridiculous. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it is quite ridiculous. Also brilliant. That's why the
system teleported us here. I wanted the engines. This is the engine
room! Hydrogenerators! Ha! <br>
BRIAN: I have literally no idea what he's saying. <br>
RORY: A spaceship powered by waves. <br>
DOCTOR: Fabulously impossible. Oh, think of the things we could learn
from this ship if we manage to stop it being blown to pieces. <br>
RORY: Plus not dying. <br>
DOCTOR: Bad news, can't shut the wave system down in time. Takes, takes
way too long. <br>
RORY: If these are the engines, there must be a control room. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. That's what we need to find. Now, what do we do about
the things that aren't kestrals? <br>
BRIAN: Oh my lord. Are those pterodactyls? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. On any other occasion, I'd be thrilled. Exposed on a
beach, less thrilled. We should be going. <br>
BRIAN: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, definitely away from them. <br>
RORY: That's the plan? <br>
DOCTOR: That's the plan. Amendments welcome. Move away from the
pterodactyls. <br>
RORY: I think they might be noticing. <br>
DOCTOR: Amendment one, run! <br>
RORY: Why don't we just teleport or something? <br>
DOCTOR: No! Local teleport burnt out on arrival. There's something in
the cliffs over there. <br>
RORY: Come on! <br>
BRIAN: I'm trying! <br>
(The pterodactyls start snapping at the men as they reach a cave
entrance in the cliffs.) </font></p>

RORY: Yeah, I'm fine. Right, what do we do now? There's no way back out
there. <br>
DOCTOR: Through the cave. Come on. <br>
(Noises ahead.) <br>
DOCTOR: That suggestion was a work in progress. <br>
BRIAN: We're trapped. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, thanks for spelling it out. <br>
RORY: Doctor, whatever's down there is coming this way. <br>
DOCTOR: Spelling it out is hereditary. Wonderful. <br>

RIDDELL: Whoever was running this vessel left in a hurry. <br>
NEFERTITI: Maybe a plague came and took them. <br>
RIDDELL: No, there'd be corpses and bones. <br>
NEFERTITI: Unless the animals ate them. <br>
AMY: Whoa, Chuckle Brothers. Lighten up, would you? <br>
(Amy tries a computer keyboard. The lights come on.) <br>
NEFERTITI: How'd you know how to do that? <br>
AMY: Well, I've spent enough time with the Doctor to know whenever you
enter somewhere new, press buttons. <br>
NEFERTITI: What else have you learned from him? <br>
AMY: Don't stop at button pressing. <br>

BLEYTAL [OC]: One hundred and seventeen years. <br>
AMY: Data records. <br>
RIDDELL: The ship's owners? <br>
AMY: Could be. Come on. Help us out. <br>
BLEYTAL [OC]: Mainly cryogenic. <br>

them, then it leaves.) <br>

AMY: How about a picture, huh? Come on, for me. <br>
BLEYTAL [OC]: Far beyond our <br>
NEFERTITI: Look. Oh, it's beautiful. <br>
BLEYTAL [on screen]: I can't tell how far we have come. Far enough to
avoid the destructive impact forecast for our planet. Far enough for me
to feel a profound sense of loss. <br>

Reptilia. <br>

AMY: But where have they gone? <br>

AMY: Why are the dinosaurs still on board, and why is the ship coming
back to Earth? It doesn't make sense. What's changed between then and
now? Wait. Computer, show me the ship at launch with all life signals.
Now show me the ship today with all life signals. Thousands less. But
why? Show me both images, then and now, side by side. <br>

rescued me but it was nearly too late. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah yes, the robots. They're unusual. <br>
SOLOMON: I got them cheap from a concession on Alyria Seven. The robots
did as best they could with my legs, but you can help me so much more. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. A doctor doctor. I see. Let's have a look. <br>
SOLOMON: They chewed through part of the bone in my legs. <br>

SOLOMON: And I don't like questions, Doctor. You boarded without my
permission. Now, fix me, or the next bolt will be fatal. <br>

just came out. <br>

talk about you. Your cosy little craft embedded in a vast old ship. <br>
SOLOMON: You're very observant. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm a Sagittarius, probably. <br>
SOLOMON: I'm transporting it to the Roxborne Peninsula. <br>
DOCTOR: A commerce colony. You're a trader. <br>
SOLOMON: I search out opportunities for profit across nine galaxies. <br>

identifying value. The database of everything across space and time
allocated a market value. Argos for the universe. You were trying to
find out how much I'm worth. <br>

SOLOMON: The pain in my legs is gone. I can move them. Thank you,

DOCTOR: What did you do to the Silurians? <br>
SOLOMON: We ejected them. The robots woke them from cryosleep a handful
at a time and jettisoned them from the airlocks. We must have left a
trail of dust and bone. <br>
DOCTOR: Because you wanted the dinosaurs. <br>
SOLOMON: Their ship crossed my path. I sent out a distress signal, they
let me board, and when I saw the cargo things became more complex. <br>
DOCTOR: Piracy and then genocide. <br>
SOLOMON: Very emotive words, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm a very emotive man. <br>
SOLOMON: The lizards wouldn't negotiate. I made them a generous offer. <br>
DOCTOR: The creatures on board this ship are not objects to be sold or
traded. <br>
SOLOMON: I feel like you're judging me. <br>
DOCTOR: You said Roxborne Peninsula, so why are you heading to Earth?
You're on the wrong course. Oh, you don't know how. Brilliant. You
couldn't change the pre-programmed course without instructions. The
ship defaulted, returned home. Oh dear. The Silurians outwitted you
even after you'd massacred them, so now you're a prisoner on the ship
you hijacked. <br>
SOLOMON: Not now you're here. You going to help me go wherever I want
to go, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Little bit of news, Solomon. You're being targeted by missiles.
Get off this ship while you still can. <br>

won't profit from me, Doctor. <br>
