hats are checking the condition of Sir Joseph Bazalgette's magnificent Victorian construction.) <br>
DAVID: Yeah, let's take a look down here. Look at the state of it. <br>
BILL: This is a hoary old one. Talk about neglect. <br>
DAVID: Yeah, there can't have been anyone down here for years. There
are more bulges than an antenatal clinic. <br>
BILL: What's that? <br>
(The torchlight picks up a new brick wall.) <br>
BILL: Hang on a minute. We are under Fleet Street? <br>
DAVID: Well, you've got the map. <br>
BILL: According to this, there was work done here seven years ago.
Three half walls with vaulted buttresses. <br>
DAVID: We must be in the wrong tunnel. <br>
BILL: No, we're not. <br>
DAVID: Hang on, I'll check it out. <br>
(David leaves.) <br>
BILL: No, we are in the right tunnel. David? David! David? You all
right? David! <br>

hanging out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here we go again. <br>
(He fiddles inside, then goes to another open roundel. There is a beep
and he returns to the first.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. Soon put you to rights. <br>
(The application of his sonic lance causes an electric arc.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that shouldn't have happened. <br>
(Peri comes running.) <br>
PERI: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Something I should have done a long time ago. </font></p>

boards.) <br>
DOCTOR: Repair the chameleon circuit. <br>
PERI: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis, when working properly, is capable of many amazing
things, not unlike myself. One of its functions is that it can change
shape to blend perfectly with its surrounding environment. <br>
(He goes to an open roundel in this room.) <br>
PERI: I see. <br>
DOCTOR: Not yet, you don't. I wonder why I didn't do it before. <br>
PERI: Look, Doctor, do you really think you're up to this? I mean,
you've only recently regenerated and yet you've undertaken so much
work. <br>
(The Doctor takes a bite from her apple and continues.) <br>
PERI: Well, what I really mean to say is, you still seem a little
unstable. <br>
DOCTOR: Unstable? Unstable? Unstable! This is me, Peri. At this very
moment I am as stable as you will ever see me. <br>
PERI: Oh dear. <br>
DOCTOR: You must forget how I used to be. I'm a Time Lord. A man of
science, temperament and passion. <br>
PERI: And a very loud voice. </font></p>

is the real me, Peri. But don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. I promise.

room, where he puts a component inside the console.) <br>
PERI: I still think you're doing too much. You need to rest. <br>
DOCTOR: Rest? Nonsense. Rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead. I
feel like a hungry man eager for the feast. Now, we've both spent too
long in the Tardis. We need a change. Where would you like to go? <br>
PERI: Well <br>
DOCTOR: For you, somewhere restful, I think. I'm sure after the
bleakness of Jaconda you could do with a sight of green hills, rolling
countryside. <br>
PERI: Yes, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I know the very place. <br>
(He enters coordinates and the Tardis tilts and goes wibbly, distorting
their voices. They hang on to the console.) <br>
PERI: Doctor, what's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: Just hold on. <br>
PERI: I'm being (something) <br>

and a man we saw a few stories ago walking away from the mayhem in Shad
Thames dressed as a police inspector looks up at the building.) <br>
LYTTON: Here we are, gentlemen. Inside that building is ten million
pounds in diamonds. <br>
(The two men in the back seat peer out of the window up at UIP House.) <br>
PAYNE: Tasty. <br>
GRIFFITHS: Very tasty. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0323093/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Brian
Glover</a>, sadly type-cast as a low-intelligence villain.) <br>
LYTTON: How long will you need? <br>
RUSSELL: About half an hour. <br>
LYTTON: I'll send these two back with the car. <br>
RUSSELL: There's no need. I'll get a cab. <br>
LYTTON: I said, Russell, I'll send the car for you. <br>
RUSSELL: Right. <br>
LYTTON: Don't look so hurt. We're not going back to the flat. We're
doing the job today. <br>
GRIFFITHS: That's all of a sudden, isn't it? <br>
LYTTON: You had something else planned? <br>
GRIFFITHS: No, it's just that I was expecting a bit more notice. <br>
LYTTON: We go today, without fail. <br>
RUSSELL: What if I can't get the explosives? <br>
LYTTON: You assured me there's be no slip-ups. <br>
RUSSELL: Yeah. But seven kilos of plastic at such short notice? <br>
LYTTON: I hope you're not telling me that there'll be problems,
Russell, because if you are, I shall be very angry. <br>
RUSSELL: Don't worry, I'll get the stuff. <br>
LYTTON: Good. <br>
(Russell gets out of the car and walks away while Payne sniggers in the
back.) <br>
PAYNE: I don't think he likes us very much, Mister Lytton. <br>
LYTTON: If he lets me down, he'll have reason not to. You, Payne, will
kill him. <br>
(Lytton drives them away.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Russell is reporting in to someone.) <br>
RUSSELL: Job's today. Well, I don't know. He's playing everything so
close. There's seven kilos of plastic. Look, don't argue, just have the
stuff ready. I'm on my way in. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis has stabilised, and is still in
flight.) <br>
DOCTOR: I must have crossed a wire. <br>
PERI: Well, I hope you never do anything more serious. I think my heart
is where my liver should be. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? At least the Tardis isn't damaged. <br>
PERI: Big deal. <br>
DOCTOR: Be grateful. If its shell had been punctured, you'd find it
very difficult to breath in a vacuum. <br>
PERI: I'm grateful. I'm grateful. Just tell me where we are, if you
can. <br>
DOCTOR: O child of little faith. <br>
PERI: Do you blame me? <br>
(The Doctor turns on the scanner. A bright white blob with a tail is
flying through the blackness of space.) <br>
PERI: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Comet nine oblique one two oblique four four. To you, Halley's
comet. <br>
PERI: It's very pretty, but it still doesn't tell me where we are. <br>
DOCTOR: In your sun's solar system, in the year that you would
calculate as 1985. I was, in fact, taking you to Earth. <br>
PERI: Bit of an anticlimax after that journey. <br>
DOCTOR: Ungrateful wretch. <br>
PERI: Well, what do you expect, applause? <br>
DOCTOR: A little gratitude wouldn't irretrievably damage my ego. <br>
PERI: Come off it, Doctor. No one is more surprised than you that we
came through it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Lytton, Griffiths and Payne take bags from the
boot of the car and go into the building at the back of the yard.) <br>
GRIFFITHS: What's this then? I thought we were doing a diamond job. <br>
LYTTON: For once, Griffiths, you're right. <br>
GRIFFITHS: Then what are we doing here? <br>
LYTTON: It may come as a great disappointment to you, but I don't
intend to enter the bank guns blazing and my face covered in a nylon
stocking. <br>
PAYNE: He's allergic to nylon. <br>
GRIFFITHS: No, I'm not. <br>
LYTTON: We go in via the sewers. <br>
(They all peer into the hole in the ground.) <br>
PAYNE: Crafty. <br>
GRIFFITHS: Down there? <br>
LYTTON: The way is prepared. All we have to do is remove a few bricks
and we're in the sewer itself. <br>
GRIFFITHS: That's good, but how do we get at the diamonds? <br>
LYTTON: Why do you think Russell has gone for explosives? <br>
GRIFFITHS: You must be joking. Set that lot off, you'll have the old
bill down on us. <br>
LYTTON: The vibrations will set off every alarm in the area. The police
won't know where to start. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: There, that should do it. <br>
PERI: No more death-defying rides? <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely not. <br>
(An open roundel blows out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, hopefully not. <br>
PERI: Don't you think we should land? <br>
DOCTOR: Not at all. I have perfect rapport with this machine. <br>
PERI: I only hope the Tardis knows it. Look, Doctor, out there are
thousands, millions of tons of ice. One ill-considered move could cause
us to collide with it. I'm scared, Doctor. You don't seem to understand
that. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course I do. But you have nothing to fear, I promise you. <br>
PERI: I hope not. It's rather ironic. On Earth, Halley's comet is
always associated with impending disaster. <br>
DOCTOR: That's nonsense. <br>
PERI: Not when you're this close, it isn't. </font></p>

steel cabinet and switches on some machinery that doesn't look as if it
belongs there. It beeps a few times then he turns it off again. Outside

PAYNE: Lose the motor. Come on. <br>

the other side of the road stop and watch.) </font></p>

of the console which is beeping.) <br>
PERI: Does that noise have anything to do with you? <br>
DOCTOR: No. It's a distress signal. <br>
PERI: How do you know? <br>
DOCTOR: Doh. Listen. That is an intergalactic distress call. <br>
PERI: Where's it coming from? <br>
DOCTOR: Can't be far, the signal is very strong. <br>
PERI: What's all that other noise? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not certain. Strange. It's coming from Earth. In 1985? <br>
PERI: That's not possible. <br>
DOCTOR: Possible it is. Desirable it isn't. I think when we arrive, we
should investigate. </font></p>

RUSSELL: Excessive. <br>
LYTTON: Insurance. <br>
RUSSELL: Start shooting that thing off, the police'll be calling out
the SAS. <br>
GRIFFITHS: He's right. That thing, it's obscene. <br>
LYTTON: Armed robbery is armed robbery. <br>
RUSSELL: How many of those things are we taking? <br>
LYTTON: Just the one. <br>
RUSSELL: It's one too many. <br>
LYTTON: What about you, Payne? <br>
PAYNE: Oh, I'm with you, Mister Lytton. <br>
GRIFFITHS: I'm with you, Mister Lytton. You're with anything that gets
you money. <br>
LYTTON: Certainly there's dissent, and you, Russell, are at the centre
of it. <br>
RUSSELL: I don't like guns, and I don't like all this secrecy. We're
supposed to be on a job, but we don't know what we're doing. <br>
LYTTON: You are new to this group and have yet to gain my confidence,
that's why I tell you nothing. These two are muscleheads and wouldn't
understand what I said anyway. <br>
GRIFFITHS: You've got a rough tongue, Mister Lytton. <br>
LYTTON: Which you will learn to live with, Griffiths, otherwise you're
out. And as your earnings have never been better, that would be rather
foolish, wouldn't it? Let's go. Come on, Payne, there's work to be
done. <br>
PAYNE: Right. <br>
(Payne gets down into the narrow access tunnel.) <br>
PAYNE: Oh. Hey, how thick is the sewer wall? <br>
LYTTON: Oh, nothing you can't handle. <br>
(Payne takes the heavy lump hammer.) <br>
PAYNE: I used to use one of these when I worked for the council. <br>

according to the sign by the gate, the Tardis materialises in familiar
territory. The Doctor peers out holding a signal detector.) <br>
DOCTOR: This looks familiar. <br>
PERI: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Scrap yard. <br>
PERI: I didn't mean that. I meant, whereabouts on Earth are we? <br>
DOCTOR: London. <br>
PERI: It didn't change. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
PERI: I thought you said it was going to blend into its surroundings. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, she's probably thinking about it. Come on, let's find out
where those signals are coming from. <br>
(The Tardis changes into a highly ornamented dresser.) <br>
PERI: Oh, neat, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Neat? <br>
PERI: Very neat. I mean, there's nothing at all incongruous about that.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, she hasn't done it for a long time. She's out of
practice. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: I suddenly feel conspicuous. <br>
PERI: I'm not surprised in that coat. <br>
DOCTOR: It's more a question of having organised a surprise party and
forgotten who it's for. <br>
PERI: Look, Doctor, since you regenerated, it's as though your memory's
been put through the meat grinder. I mean, it's all there, but in a
pile of unrelated bits and pieces. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a horrible simile. <br>
PERI: It's true, though. In the past couple of days you've called me
Tegan, Zoe, Susan. On one occasion you even referred to me as Jamie. <br>
DOCTOR: Merely slips of the tongue. <br>
PERI: I rather think they're slips of the mind. And while we're about
it, who is this Terrible Zodin? <br>
DOCTOR: I called you Zodin, did I? Oh, they don't make villains like
her any more. A woman of rare guile and devilish cunning. <br>
PERI: Thanks a lot. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps you're right. My mind may be playing tricks on me. You
know, I haven't thought about Zodin for years. <br>
PERI: Now where? <br>
(The Doctor leads her out of the alley at the back of the houses into
the road proper. He starts to go towards the junction then turns and
heads the other way. As they pass the alleyway we see the two policemen
standing there, watching. The Doctor goes to a building on a corner.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's it. It's unoccupied. <br>
PERI: Are you sure this is the right place? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I'm a fool. Of course I am. That's precisely what I
would have done. <br>
PERI: What? <br>
(He runs back up the alley again. There are no policemen in sight.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>

RUSSELL: Remember that scuffling sound we heard earlier? I heard it
again. <br>
LYTTON: Payne, if we are being followed, deal with them. <br>

PERI: Peri. Yeah, well, supposing there really are aliens here on
Earth. I mean, does it really matter? I mean, they don't all have ten
heads and want to take over the world. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. The poor thing may be trapped here, terrified. If it
is, I can do something about it. <br>
(The Tardis is still the highly ornate and nicely painted with floral
motifs dresser or whatever. The policemen watch from the gate.) <br>
PERI: That's if you can find the entrance. How do we get in? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not sure. <br>
PERI: Well, there still is a way in? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course there is. Somewhere. <br>

who are the ones Lytton was controlling back in Resurrection, watch
impassively as the Tardis dematerialises.) </font></p>

DOCTOR: The source of the distress signal. <br>
PERI: I thought you said it was in the house? <br>
DOCTOR: It is, but the source of the signal is transmitting from some
elsewhere. <br>
PERI: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: I also detected several weaker signals going into the house.
Our alien is being ultra-cautious. He's bouncing the signal off several
relay points around London. It could take days to find out where it's
coming from. <br>
PERI: Giving him plenty of time to move on. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. You are brilliant, Peri. Absolutely brilliant! If the
signal is being relayed to prevent detection, then the house has to be
watched. <br>
PERI: Otherwise, how would the alien know someone had discovered his
main transmitter? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Let's find our alien before he has time to vanish. <br>
(The two policemen go to the junk yard.) <br>
DOCTOR: Almost there. Just got to lock on to his coordinates. <br>
PERI: I hope this alien appreciates what we're doing. <br>

waiting for us to arrive. <br>

ground.) <br>

PERI: He's got a gun. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not blind, Peri. You look uncomfortable in that hole. Let
me help you out. <br>
(The policeman waves his gun at the Doctor, who kicks it away then
pushes him down the hole. The Doctor follows and blows are exchanged
out of sight. The second policeman comes up behind Peri. She backs away
to a pile of bricks, gathers up some dust and throws it in his eyes. He
drops the gun and she picks it up.) <br>
PERI: Even I couldn't miss from this range. <br>
(The policeman relaxes as his colleagues helmet comes out of the hole.
Peri turns her gun on it, but the Doctor is wearing it.) <br>
PERI: Never do such a stupid thing again. I could have killed you. <br>
DOCTOR: I believe you. <br>
PERI: Don't patronise me. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't dare. You did very well. I'm impressed. <br>
(The Doctor frisks the policeman and gets his handcuffs.) <br>
PERI: What happened to the other one? <br>
DOCTOR: He's er, having a little lie-down. <br>
(The Doctor handcuffs the policeman to a set of industrial scales.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. Key. <br>
(The policeman hands over a set of keys.) <br>
PERI: I'm assuming these aren't the real police. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you are correct in that assumption. Thank you. <br>
PERI: But why did they try to kill us? <br>
DOCTOR: The bottom of that pit has been dug out. I think it leads to
the sewers. Come on. <br>

ground. Peri unscrews the silencer and puts the gun in her shorts

to that. <br>

arrived. <br>
RUSSELL: Can I see the map? <br>

GRIFFITHS: That's not very kind, Mister Lytton. <br>
RUSSELL: Hang on a minute, this is getting stupid. That wall isn't
supposed to be there. <br>

RUSSELL: Oh, great. Terrific. I thought you'd recced all this. <br>
LYTTON: We're in the right place. <br>
RUSSELL: But how do we know that's right? Nothing else is. <br>
LYTTON: Unless you want to throw away ten million pounds in diamonds, I
suggest one of you starts knocking the wall down. <br>
(Meanwhile, elsewhere in the dark.) <br>
PERI: I only hope this is the right direction. <br>
DOCTOR: You saw the signs and scuff marks on the bricks. <br>
PERI: They could have been made at any time. <br>
DOCTOR: No, they're recent. I have an instinct for these things. <br>
PERI: To think this is my first visit to London. <br>
DOCTOR: It is an interesting city. <br>
PERI: I'm sure it's fascinating. It'd be nice to see the sights like a
regular tourist. <br>

Lytton offers the sonic lance.) <br>
LYTTON: Is this any use? I wouldn't try sticking it into the Cyber
Controller. He might snap your hand off. <br>
PERI: What are you trying to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Upset the navigational control. If I can distort the
coordinates by just a fraction of a degree <br>
PERI: We'd miss Telos. <br>
DOCTOR: Not quite. <br>
GRIFFITHS: What is Telos? Is no one going to tell me? <br>
LYTTON: I would have thought, Griffiths, even you would have managed to
work that out by now. Telos is the Cybermen's home planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Uh huh. Adopted planet. You'd have liked Telos, Peri, in the
old days when the Cryons were in residence. They were the indigenous
population till the Cybermen wiped them out. <br>
LYTTON: They had nowhere else to go. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, man. The universe is littered with
unpopulated planets. <br>
LYTTON: But few with the facilities that Telos offered. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's hardly an excuse. <br>
PERI: What does he mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Refrigeration. <br>
PERI: That's a strange reason to commit genocide. <br>
DOCTOR: Not when you build refrigerated cities the way the Cryons did.
They had a genius for it. Mind you, they had to. They couldn't live in
temperatures above zero. <br>
GRIFFITHS: But why did the Cybermen need the cold? <br>
DOCTOR: Hibernation. They were running out of power. They needed to
rest. And whatever you may say, Lytton, they could have built their own
hibernation plant and refrigeration chambers anywhere. <br>
PERI: Well, why not on their own planet? I assume they had one. What's
the matter? <br>
GRIFFITHS: What is the matter? <br>
LYTTON: Yes, Doctor. What's the matter? </font></p>

LYTTON: But tell them how it was destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: You're enjoying this. <br>
LYTTON: It's not often I have the opportunity to watch a Time Lord
squirm. <br>
DOCTOR: It blew up. <br>
LYTTON: Whilst it was attacking Earth. <br>
GRIFFITHS: What? <br>
LYTTON: Tell them when. <br>
DOCTOR: Take no notice of him. He's just trying to unnerve you. Your
planet survived the attack. <br>
PERI: When did it happen? <br>
DOCTOR: 1986. <br>
GRIFFITHS: Next year? That's almost now. <br>
DOCTOR: You could put it that way. <br>
PERI: Well, you must do something. Inform Earth, tell them it's coming.
I mean, what's happening to us now must have something to do with that.
<br>
DOCTOR: How can I do anything? I'm a prisoner. <br>
LYTTON: Even if he were free, he couldn't. He would transgress the laws
of time. <br>
PERI: You interfere continually. <br>
DOCTOR: Not to that extent. Even I have to be careful. <br>
LYTTON: The Time Lords would have him destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: And that would please you. Look, don't worry. Earth survived
with minimal damage. It's an historical fact. <br>
LYTTON: Yes, it's now become part of the web of time in the same way
that the Cryons were destroyed. <br>
PERI: I'm not interested in the Cryons. <br>
LYTTON: Hmm. There's compassion for you. <br>
PERI: I didn't mean it like that. I'm confused. <br>
GRIFFITHS: So am I. I mean, how can a planet travel around off its
orbit? <br>
DOCTOR: Mondas had a propulsion unit. A tribute to Cyber engineering.
Though why they should want to push a planet through space, I've no
idea. <br>

off.) <br>

then goes back one. A green slime Cyberman burst out and grabs her. She
screams, and two slender beings come out of the other door and attack
it with their weapons. They take Peri with them into the cubicle as the

GRIFFITHS: Does she know who you are? <br>
THREST: Of course. Lytton has come to help us. <br>
GRIFFITHS: You certainly know how to put yourself about. <br>
LYTTON: I was stranded on Earth. I sent out a distress call, the Cryons
picked it up. <br>
THREST: And we told him the Cybermen had invaded our planet. <br>
LYTTON: And I tricked the Cybermen into bringing us here to Telos. <br>
THREST: For we need Lytton's help to defeat them. We also need you. <br>
GRIFFITHS: Me? <br>
THREST: It was why you were brought here. <br>

GRIFFITHS: You never did intend to do that diamond job. <br>
LYTTON: Would you have come if I'd told you the truth? <br>
GRIFFITHS: You bet I wouldn't. <br>
LYTTON: That, Griffiths, is why I didn't tell you. <br>
GRIFFITHS: That, Mister Lytton, is why two men are dead. <br>
LYTTON: It wasn't of my making. <br>
GRIFFITHS: It certainly wasn't of theirs. <br>
THREST: We realise this must be confusing for you, but there is a way
for you to get home. And of course, being a professional like Lytton,
we realise your time is valuable. <br>
GRIFFITHS: Are you winding me up? <br>
(Threst looks to Lytton for a translation.) <br>
LYTTON: Attempting to annoy. <br>
THREST: I hope not. We intend to pay you. <br>
GRIFFITHS: What can you pay me? <br>
LYTTON: The equivalent of two million pounds in uncut diamonds. <br>
(Threst gives Griffiths a small cloth bag.) <br>
THREST: We were surprised you wanted so little. <br>
LYTTON: Diamonds are common on Telos. <br>

FLAST: Ah, escape. They all talk about that for the first few minutes,
then they become depressed. It's the locked door and the armed guard

DOCTOR: When they learn about this, they'll kill you. <br>
FLAST: They'll simply complete a job they started some time ago. That
is what I've been waiting for, Time Lord. <br>
(The Doctor looks at his sonic lance.) <br>
FLAST: There is enough explosive in here to annihilate Cyber Control. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's not much power left in this lance, and that stuff
is very cold. It may not generate enough heat. <br>
(The Doctor gives Flast the sonic lance.) <br>
FLAST: The Cybermen will not leave Telos. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tunnels]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROST: You must wait here, child. There will be a
guard on the Tardis. <br>
PERI: It won't work. I can't operate the controls. If I try to move the
Tardis, anything could happen. <br>
VARNE: We said we'd help you. <br>
PERI: I don't think you realise how temperamental that machine is. I
mean, even the Doctor has problems piloting it. <br>
(Varne's belt communicator beeps.) <br>
VARNE: Varne. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CONTROLLER: You have wasted both our time and
energy. I know that you plan to steal or destroy my time vessel. You
will tell me how it is to be done. <br>
(Lytton stays silent, so two Cybermen take hold of his hands and
squeeze. Blood pours down them and he falls to the floor, screaming.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Rost takes a careful look around the corner to
where the Tardis is parked, then returns.) <br>
ROST: There is a guard. There may be others inside. <br>
PERI: Well, don't look at me. I'm not going in after them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cyber Control]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CONTROLLER: You are foolish, Lytton. You could
have saved yourself from pain. I told you you would tell us everything.
Now you will become as we are. <br>
CYBERMAN: The time vessel is approaching Telos, Controller. <br>
CONTROLLER: Excellent. Order it to land and have the Doctor brought to
me. <br>
CYBERMAN: Controller. (beep) The Cyberman guarding the Doctor does not
respond. <br>
CONTROLLER: Show him to me. <br>
(The monitor shows the open storeroom door.) <br>
CONTROLLER: The Doctor has escaped. He must be found. <br>
(Flast switches on the sonic lance, places it in a box of vastial and
closes the lid. She watches the steam drift out of it. <br>
Meanwhile, Bates, Stratton and Griffiths hear the time vessel lands on
the roof of Cyber Control above them.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cyber tombs]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor discovers the guard on the Tardis and
retreats into a gun held by a Cryon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. <br>
VARNE: Unless you help us, you won't be for very much longer. <br>
(Peri, Rost and another Cryon come out of a tomb.) <br>
PERI: Doctor, you escaped. You've got to help me. They want to destroy
the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's not very friendly. <br>
ROST: It would be more accurate to say that we do not wish the Cybermen
to control it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there at least we agree. How many Cybermen are inside the
Tardis? <br>
VARNE: We have no way of telling. <br>
DOCTOR: Then we must find out. <br>
(He tries to shoulder his way into a tomb, and fails.) <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mind? <br>
(Varne uses her gun to blast the door.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cyber tomb]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A green, dead, Cyberman lies on the floor. The
Doctor goes to its head.) <br>
PERI: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Cybermen have an inbuilt distress signal. <br>
PERI: But this thing's dead. <br>
(The Doctor opens its faceplate.) <br>
DOCTOR: The signal is mechanical, not organic. There may be enough
power left in this battery to transmit. <br>
PERI: And achieve what? <br>
DOCTOR: A reaction from those inside the Tardis. The Cybermen have one
weakness. They'll react to the distress of their own kind. When I was a
prisoner in Cyber Control, I met a friend of yours. <br>
VARNE: Flast? But we thought she was dead. <br>
DOCTOR: If she isn't now, she soon will be. She's at the moment the
living detonator of a bomb that could go off at any second and kill us
all. <br>
(The Cyberman's distress signal works.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Storeroom]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LEADER: Search the room. The Doctor may have
interfered with the vastial. <br>
CYBERMAN: Leader. <br>
(They've found Flast.) <br>
LEADER: How long has the Doctor been gone? <br>
FLAST: I don't know. I don't have an instrument for measuring time. <br>
(Two Cybermen grab her shoulders.) <br>
LEADER: You will answer my questions. <br>
FLAST: I will not. <br>
LEADER: Very well, take her outside. <br>
(They push Flast into the corridor, where steam starts to come off her
as she writhes until she dies.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the launch pad]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BATES: According to the map, the launching pad is
on the other side of this door. <br>
STRATTON: We made it! <br>
GRIFFITHS: Let's get aboard the ship before we open the champagne. <br>
BATES: Give me that thing. Ready? <br>
(Bates takes the Cyber gun from Griffiths, then is suddenly pulled
against the door, where he screams and dies. Then the door opens, and a
Cyberman shoots Stratton and Griffiths in the back as they try to run
away.) </font></p>

alcove.) <br>
CYBERMAN: The intruders have been destroyed. <br>
CONTROLLER: Excellent. You will all accompany me. <br>
(In the storeroom, Cybermen are packing up some items into a trolley,
while the vastial is quietly heating up by the far wall.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor sees another Cyberman come out of the
Tardis. He goes back to the Cryons and Peri.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you ready? <br>
ROST: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: There are two of them. This way. <br>
(They hide behind pillars. As the Cybermen approach the area of the
distress signal, Rost shoots one of them with her Cyber gun. Varne
steps out to get the other, but is killed herself, so Threst (I think)
kills the Cyberman.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. <br>
ROST: Please remove your Tardis from Telos before you have to be
rescued again. <br>
DOCTOR: What about you, Rost? <br>
ROST: We shall survive. <br>
PERI: But Doctor, what about Lytton? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
PERI: He's been captured by the Cybermen. <br>
DOCTOR: That should make him happy. <br>
PERI: You don't understand. He's working for the Cryons. <br>
DOCTOR: For you? <br>
ROST: Yes, for us. <br>
PERI: Well, you can't just let him die. <br>
DOCTOR: Where's he likely to be now? <br>
ROST: In the laboratory. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll see what I can do. Good luck. <br>
ROST: And to you, Doctor. </font></p>

CYBERMAN: Controller, the technicians at the Doctor's Tardis do not
respond to our call. <br>
CONTROLLER: That is not possible. <br>
CYBERMAN: Instruments also indicate time disturbance. <br>
CONTROLLER: The Tardis has been moved. </font></p>

the room. There are no complete Cybermen present. The Doctor comes out
and goes over to him.) <br>
LYTTON: I know you. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. And I'm just beginning to find out about you. <br>
LYTTON: Did you put the sonic lance to good use? <br>
DOCTOR: I did. Why didn't you say something? <br>
LYTTON: Now you must kill me. <br>
DOCTOR: I can help you. Hang on. <br>
LYTTON: The drug is affecting my brain. Irreversible damage. <br>
(The Doctor takes a sharp instrument from a computer console.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I'll tell you if its irreversible or not. Now
just hang on. <br>
LYTTON: I did my best. I kept my word. <br>
(The Doctor starts trying to disconnect Lytton from the alcove
systems.) <br>
DOCTOR: I know. <br>
LYTTON: Please, Doctor. Kill me. <br>
(The Cyber Controller enters, weapon ready.) <br>
CONTROLLER: Move away from him, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor puts the knife in Lytton's hand.) <br>
CONTROLLER: Emotion is a weakness. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so. <br>
CONTROLLER: It brought you back for your friend and it will cost you
your life. <br>
(The Controller comes closer. Lytton stabs it in the arm, severing a
fluid tube. Green spurts everywhere as Lytton stabs again and again.
The Doctor scrambles for the Controller's gun and shoots a Cyberman who
enters the room. It spins round into the one behind it and the Doctor
shoots it, too. Then the Controller starts flailing around, knocking
the Doctor across the room. He grabs another gun and shoots it. The
Controller's chest plate explodes satisfactorily. Peri has watched all
this on the scanner. She comes out and joins the Doctor by the fallen
Lytton.) <br>
DOCTOR: I must help him. <br>
PERI: It's too late, Doctor. He's dead. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't just leave him. <br>
PERI: You must. There's nothing you can do. <br>
DOCTOR: Why didn't he say something? <br>
PERI: You never gave him a chance. <br>
(The Doctor hustles Peri into the Tardis and it dematerialises. The
Cybermen discover the smouldering box of explosive just before it goes
off, and the whole of Cyber Control goes KaBOOM!) </font></p>

DOCTOR: I meant on a personal level. I don't think I've ever misjudged
anybody quite as badly as I did Lytton. </font> </p>
