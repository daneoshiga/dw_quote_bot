investigators are completing their set up in the entrance hall by the
staircase.) <br>
EMMA: How are we looking? <br>
PALMER: Oh, about ready, I think. <br>
EMMA: Any thoughts on the interference? <br>
PALMER: Er, a stray FM broadcast, possibly. I've fitted some ferrite
suppressors and some RF chokes, just in case. Are you sure you want to
go through with this? I mean, the last time, it was very <br>
EMMA: But she's so lonely. <br>
PALMER: Excellent, then. Excellent. (into microphone) Caliburn House,
night four, November 25th, 1974. 11.04 pm. <br>
EMMA: I'm talking to the spirit that inhabits this house. Are you
there? Can you hear me? I'm speaking to the lost soul that abides in
this place. <br>
(There is a reaction on the paper graph.) <br>
EMMA: Come to me. Speak to me. Let me show you the way home. <br>
(Something painful comes through the Major's headphones.) <br>
EMMA: Let me show you the way home! <br>
(Palmer grabs his Nikon camera and starts taking photographs of the
white image approaching them. Emma gasps then staggers for a chair.) <br>
PALMER: Emma? <br>
EMMA: She's so <br>
PALMER: So what? <br>
EMMA: Dead. <br>
(There is a knock on the door. Palmer opens it carefully. No one
there.) <br>
DOCTOR: Boo! Hello, I'm looking for a ghost. <br>
PALMER: And you are? <br>
CLARA: Ghostbusters. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. <br>
(He holds up his psychic paper.) <br>
PALMER: Doctor what? <br>
DOCTOR: If you like. And this is Clara. <br>
(He runs over to the tables of equipment.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, but you are very different. You are Major Alec Palmer.
Member of the Baker Street Irregulars, the Ministry of Ungentlemanly
Warfare. Specialised in espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance behind
enemy lines. You're a talented watercolourist, professor of psychology
and ghost hunter. Total pleasure. Massive. <br>
EMMA: Actually, you're wrong. Professor Palmer spent most of the war as
a POW. <br>
DOCTOR: Actually, that's a like told by a very brave man involved in
very secret operations. The type of man who keeps a Victoria Cross in a
box in the attic, eh? But you know that, because you're Emma Grayling,
the Professor's companion. <br>
EMMA: Assistant. <br>
DOCTOR: It's 1974. You're the assistant and non-objective equipment.
Meaning psychic. <br>
CLARA: Getting that. Bless you, though. <br>
PALMER: Relax, Emma. He's Military Intelligence. So, what is all this
in aid of? <br>
DOCTOR: Health and safety. Yeah, the Ministry got wind of what's going
on down here. Sent me to check that everything's in order. <br>
PALMER: They don't have the right. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, guv'nor, I'll be out of your hair in five minutes.
Oh! Oh, look. Oh, lovely. The ACR 99821. Oh, bliss. Nice action on the
toggle switches. You know, I do love a toggle switch. Actually, I like
the word toggle. Nice noun. Excellent verb. Oi, don't mess with the
settings. <br>
(The Doctor does a quick sweep with the sonic screwdriver.) <br>
PALMER: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Gadget. Health and safety. Classified, I'm afraid. You know,
while the back room boffins work out a few kinks. <br>
CLARA: What's it telling you? <br>
DOCTOR: It's telling me that you haven't been exposed to any
life-threatening transmundane emanations. So, where's the ghost? Show
me the ghost. It's ghost time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor leads the way with a three pronged
candelabra.) <br>
PALMER: I will not have this stolen out from under me, do you
understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, no, not really, sorry. <br>
PALMER: I will not have my work stolen, then be fobbed off with a pat
on the back and a letter from the Queen. Never again. This is my house,
Doctor, and it belongs to me. <br>
CLARA: This is actually your house? <br>
PALMER: It is. <br>
CLARA: Sorry. You went to the bank and said, you know that gigantic old
haunted house on the moors? The one the dossers are too scared to doss
in? The one the birds are too scared to fly over? And then you said,
I'd like to buy it, please, with my money. <br>
PALMER: Yes, I did, actually. <br>
CLARA: That's incredibly brave. <br>
(Something creaks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, Major, we just need to know what's going on here. <br>
PALMER: For the Ministry. <br>
DOCTOR: You know I can't answer that. <br>
PALMER: Very well, follow me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Living room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Warmly furnished. The Doctor takes photographs of
himself. Food and drink is stocked on a collapsible table.) <br>
CLARA: So, what's an empathic psychic? <br>
EMMA: Sometimes I sense feelings, the way a telepath can sense
thoughts. Sometimes, though. Not always. <br>
DOCTOR: The most compassionate people you'll ever meet, empathics. And
the loneliest. I mean, exposing themselves to all those hidden
feelings, all that guilt, pain and sorrow and <br>
CLARA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
CLARA: Shush. <br>
PALMER: Would you care to have a look? <br>
(Palmer has a lot of photographs pinned to a board.) <br>
PALMER: Caliburn House is over four hundred years old, but she has been
here much longer. The Caliburn Ghast. <br>
(Classic Edwardian ghost photographs.) <br>
PALMER: She's mentioned in local Saxon poetry and parish folk tales.
The Wraith of the Lady, the Maiden in the Dark, the Witch of the Well. <br>
CLARA: Is she real? As in, actually real? <br>
PALMER: Oh, she's real. In the seventeenth century, a local clergyman
saw her. He wrote that her presence was accompanied by a dreadful
knocking, as if the Devil himself demanded entry. During the war,
American airmen stationed here left offerings of tinned Spam. The tins
were found in 1965, bricked up in the servants' pantry, along with a
number of handwritten notes. Appeals to the Ghast. For the love of God,
stop screaming. <br>
CLARA: She never changes. The angle's different, the framing, but she's
always in exactly the same position. Why is that? <br>
PALMER: We don't know. She's an objective phenomenon, but objective
recording equipment can't detect her <br>
DOCTOR: Without the presence of a powerful psychic. <br>
PALMER: Absolutely. Very well done. <br>
EMMA: She knows I'm here. I can feel her calling out to me. <br>
CLARA: What's she saying? <br>
EMMA: Help me. <br>
(A shadow whizzes past the entrance to the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Witch of the Well. So where's the well? <br>
PALMER: A copy of the oldest plan that we could find. There is no well
on the property. None that we could find, anyway. <br>
(The Doctor taps Clara on the head, making her jump.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) You coming? <br>
CLARA: (sotto) Where? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) To find the ghost. <br>
CLARA: (sotto) Why would I want to do that? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Because you want to. Come on. <br>
CLARA: (sotto) Well, I dispute that assertion. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Eh? I'm giving you a face. Can you see me? Look at my
face. <br>
CLARA: (sotto) Fine. Dare me. <br>
DOCTOR: I dare you. No takesies backsies. <br>
(Clara takes the candelabra and leaves.) <br>
EMMA: The music room is the heart of the house. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CLARA: Say we actually find her. What do we say? <br>
DOCTOR: We ask her how she came to be whatever she is. <br>
CLARA: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I don't know, and ignorance is, what's the opposite of
bliss? <br>
CLARA: Carlisle. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, Carlisle. Ignorance is Carlisle. <br>
(Something moves in the shadows behind them. They find the kitchen.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> EMMA: Is he really from the Ministry? <br>
PALMER: Er, I don't know. He's certainly got the right demeanour.
Capricious, brilliant. <br>
EMMA: Deceitful. <br>
PALMER: Yes. Ha. He's a liar. But, you know, that's often the way that
it is when someone's seen a thing or two. Experience makes liars of us
all. We lie about who we are, about what we've done. <br>
EMMA: And how we feel? <br>
PALMER: Yes. Always. Always that. You know, I have to, have to be
getting on with things. The er, the equipment and so forth. <br>
EMMA: Of course. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Music room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The big harp gives it away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, the music room. The heart of the house. Do you feel
anything? <br>
CLARA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Your pants are so on fire. <br>
(The sonic screwdriver stutters.) <br>
CLARA: (sotto) Do you feel like you're being watched? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) What does being watched feel like? Is it that funny
tickly feeling on the back of your neck? <br>
CLARA: (sotto) That's the chap. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Then yes, a bit. Well, quite a big bit. <br>
(Wood creaking.) <br>
CLARA: I think she's here. <br>
(By a door, the Doctor can see his breath.) <br>
DOCTOR: Cold spot. Spooky. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold.
Warm. Cold. <br>
(The Doctor draws a chalk circle around the cold area.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
CLARA: I'm not happy. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
CLARA: Hey! <br>
(She runs after him, stepping in the circle. The paper graph registers
something. Steam rises from the edges of the circle.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CLARA: What was that? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PALMER: Does it seem colder? <br>

the windows.) <br>
EMMA: She's coming. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CLARA: Okay, what is that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a very loud noise. It's a very loud, very angry noise. <br>
CLARA: What's making it? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Are you making it? <br>
(Bang! Bang!) <br>
CLARA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
CLARA: I may be a teeny, tiny bit terrified. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
CLARA: But I'm still a grown-up. <br>
DOCTOR: Mainly, yes, and? <br>
CLARA: There's no need to actually hold my hand. <br>
DOCTOR: Clara. <br>
CLARA: Yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not holding your hand. <br>
(They look behind them, scream and run down the stairs.) </font></p>

mid-air.) <br>
DOCTOR: Has this happened before? <br>
PALMER: Never. <br>
DOCTOR: Camera. Camera! <br>
(Click, and glass inside the thing cracks. Something materialises in
front of Emma, but no one else notices. She is seeing a shiny figure in
the woods. Clara turns.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor? <br>
(The Doctor takes pictures.) <br>
WOMAN [OC]: Help me! <br>
(Emma collapses into Palmer's arms.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor. <br>
(The words Help Me are frozen into the wall by the staircase, then they
evaporate and the black concave vanishes.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Emma takes a sip of whisky.) <br>
EMMA: Urgh. I'd rather have a nice cup of tea. <br>
CLARA: Me too. Whisky is the eleventh most disgusting thing ever
invented. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Developing the night's film.) <br>
DOCTOR: I had a little peek at your records, back at the Ministry.
You've certainly seen a thing or two in your time. Disrupting U-boat
operations across the North Sea, sabotaging railway lines across
Europe. Operation Gibbon. The one with the carrier pigeons, brilliant.
I do love a carrier pigeon. <br>
PALMER: I did my duty, but then so did thousands of others. Millions of
others. I was just lucky enough to come back. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but how does that man, that war hero, end up here in a
lonely old house, looking for ghosts? <br>
PALMER: Because I killed, and I caused to have killed. I sent young men
and women to their deaths, but here I am, still alive and it does tend
to haunt you. Living, after so much of the other thing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CLARA: So, you and Professor Palmer, have you
ever, you know? <br>
EMMA: No. <br>
CLARA: Why not? You do know how he feels about you, don't you? You, of
all people? <br>
EMMA: I don't know. People like me, sometimes we get our signals mixed
up. We think people are feeling the way we want them to feel, you know,
when they are special to us, when really there's nothing there. <br>
CLARA: Oh, this is there. <br>
EMMA: How do you know? <br>
CLARA: Because it's obvious. It sticks out like a big chin. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PALMER: You see, I was alone and unmarried and I
didn't mind dying. I mean, not for that cause. It was a very, very fine
cause, defeating the enemy. <br>
DOCTOR: And if you could contact them, what would you say? <br>
PALMER: Well, I'd very much like to thank them. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha. Ping! <br>
(He hangs up a photograph to dry.) <br>
PALMER: Who do you think she is? <br>
(The screaming face behind the Doctor in the photograph.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not what I thought she'd be. <br>
PALMER: What did you think she's be? <br>
DOCTOR: Fun. Can I borrow your camera? Ta. </font></p>

CLARA: Oh, I don't think so. <br>
EMMA: Good. <br>

Tardis has parked herself in what look like old cloisters.) <br>
CLARA: (sotto) I've got this weird feeling it's looking at me. It
doesn't like me. <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis is like a cat. A bit slow to trust, but you'll get
there in the end. <br>
(He runs inside and the door shuts. Clara has to knock.) </font></p>

CLARA: Hey. You need a place to keep this. <br>
(The umbrella.) <br>
DOCTOR: I've got one. Or I had one. I think I had one. Look around. See
if you find it. Did I have one? Am I going mad? <br>
(Clara shakes the water off the umbrella.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, not in here. How do you expect her to like you? She's
soaking wet. It's a health and safety nightmare. <br>
CLARA: Sorry. So, where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: Nowhere. We're staying right here. Right here, on this exact
spot, if I can work out how to do it. <br>
CLARA: So, when are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that is good. That is top-notch. <br>
CLARA: And the answer is? <br>
DOCTOR: We're going always. <br>
CLARA: We're going always. <br>
DOCTOR: Totally. <br>
CLARA: That's not actually a sentence. <br>
(The Doctor gets his orange environment suit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's got a verb in it. What do you think? <br>
CLARA: Colour's a bit boisterous. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it brings out my eyes. <br>
CLARA: Makes my eyes hurt. </font></p>

when the Earth was still cooling. The Doctor takes a photograph and
comes back inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Back off. Hot suit. Hot, hot, hot. <br>
CLARA: When are we? <br>
DOCTOR: About six billion years ago. It's a Tuesday, I think. <br>
(Next stop, a tropical jungle with giant dragonflies. Eventually,
Victorian times as a lady in crinoline and man in top hat walk up the
stone steps in front of the house. Finally, he is in the environment
suit again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Back in a mo. Are you all right? <br>
CLARA: Totally. Peachy keen. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay then. Well, don't press any buttons or pull any levers or
make any funny faces. Actually, don't move. Stand completely still.
Don't breathe. Well, you can breathe, but shallow breaths. <br>
(Clara watches the Doctor on the scanner. The ground is devastated,
with just a bit of roof and chimney lying on the ground. The air
shimmers in the heat. He takes his photograph. That old Nikon certainly
can put up with a lot of different conditions. He returns.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. What's wrong? Did the Tardis say something to you? Are you
being mean? <br>
CLARA: No, it's not that. Have we just watched the entire life cycle of
Earth, birth to death? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
CLARA: And you're okay with that? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
CLARA: How can you be? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis, she's time. We. Wibbly vortex and so on. <br>
CLARA: That's not what I mean. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, some help. Context? Cheat sheet? Something? <br>
CLARA: I mean, one minute you're in 1974 looking for ghosts, but all
you have to do is open your eyes and talk to whoever's standing there.
To you, I haven't been born yet, and to you I've been dead one hundred
billion years. Is my body out there somewhere, in the ground? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose it is. <br>
CLARA: But here we are, talking. So I am a ghost. To you, I'm a ghost.
We're all ghosts to you. We must be nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No. You're not that. <br>
CLARA: Then what are we? What can we possibly be? <br>
DOCTOR: You are the only mystery worth solving. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis returns to their starting point as we
are given a glimpse of something climbing in through a window. The
Doctor hands over his roll of film for developing.) <br>
EMMA: What's wrong? <br>
CLARA: I just saw something I wish I hadn't. <br>
EMMA: What did you see? <br>
CLARA: That everything ends. <br>
EMMA: No, not everything. Not love. Not always. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, done. That's it. Gather round, gather round. Roll up,
roll up. <br>
(They have made slides from the negatives. The Doctor activates the
projector with the sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Ghast of Caliburn House. Never changing, trapped in a
moment of fear and torment. But, what if she's not? What if she's just
trapped somewhere time runs more slowly than it does here? What if a
second to her was a hundred thousand years to us? And what if somebody
has a magic box. A blue box, probably. What if said somebody could take
a snapshot of her, say, every few million years? <br>
(And up comes a shot of a dark woman in a white coverall, running.) <br>
DOCTOR: She's not a ghost. But she's definitely a lost soul. Her name
is Hila Tacorian. She's a pioneer, a time traveller, or at least she
will be in a few hundred years. <br>
PALMER: Time travel's not possible. The paradoxes <br>
DOCTOR: Resolve themselves, by and large. <br>
EMMA: How long has she been alone? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, time travel's a funny old thing. I mean, from her
perspective, she crash landed three minutes ago. <br>
EMMA: Crash landed? Where? <br>
DOCTOR: She's in a pocket universe. A distorted echo of our own. They
happen sometimes but never last for long. <br>
(The Doctor blows up a blue balloon, then a red one. Our universe. Hila
Tacorian's here, in a pocket universe. You're a lantern, shining across
the dimensions, guiding her home, back to the land of the living. <br>
CLARA: But what's she running from? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's the best bit. We don't know yet. Shall we see? <br>
(Next slide.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
(There is a thing behind a tree.) <br>
CLARA: What is that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Still, not to worry. <br>
EMMA: So, what do we do? <br>
DOCTOR: Not we, you. You save Hila Tacorian because you are Emma
Grayling. You are the lantern. The rest of us are just along for the
ride, I'm afraid. We need some sturdy rope and a blue crystal from
Metebelis Three. Plus some Kendal Mint Cake. <br>
(The rain has stopped when the Doctor and Clara run back to the
Tardis.) <br>
PALMER: Don't do it. <br>
EMMA: I'm sorry? <br>
PALMER: Nobody asked her to risk her life. This woman, she doesn't
deserve. Whoever she is, however brilliant, however brave, she's not
you. She is not worth risking a single hair on your head. Not to me. <br>
EMMA: Tell me what I'm thinking. <br>
PALMER: I can't. I don't have your gift. <br>
EMMA: You don't need it. Just look at me and tell me. <br>

DOCTOR: What? <br>
CLARA: Fly the Tardis into the parallel universe? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, it's not a parallel universe. It's a pocket universe. Plus,
it is collapsing. I mean, the Tardis could get in there all right, but
entropy would bleed her power sources, you see? Trap her there until
the entire universe decayed back into the quantum foam. Which would
take about three minutes, give or take, you know. </font></p>

height. Clocks have been places around the room. Emma and Palmer are
wearing coats.) <br>
CLARA: What is that? <br>
DOCTOR: A subset of the Eye of Harmony. <br>
CLARA: I don't <br>
DOCTOR: Of course you don't. Be weird if you did. I barely do myself.
Right. You, sit down. All the way from Metebelis Three. <br>
(The Doctor puts a headset with a blue gem in it onto Emma.) <br>
EMMA: What does it do? <br>
DOCTOR: It amplifies your natural abilities like a microphone, or a
pooper scooper. <br>
PALMER: What exactly is this arrangement? <br>
DOCTOR: A psychochronograph. <br>
PALMER: Forgive me, but isn't it all a bit well, make do and mend? <br>
(The Doctor puts on a parachute harness.) <br>
DOCTOR: Non-psychic technology won't work where I'm going. Listen, all
I need to do is dive into another dimension, find the time traveller,
help her escape the monster. get home before the entire dimension
collapses and Bob's your uncle. <br>
EMMA: Doctor, will it hurt? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Well, yes. Probably. A bit. Well, quite a lot. I don't
know. It might be agony. To be perfectly honest, I'll be interested to
find out. <br>
(Emma looks at Palmer, who nods.) <br>
EMMA: I'm talking to the lost soul that abides in this place. I'm
speaking to Hila Tarcorian. <br>
(The clocks start to go backwards. The Doctor hitches his harness to a
thick rope as the black disc appears and a strong wind blows through.) <br>
DOCTOR: See? The Witch of the Well! It's a wormhole! A reality well! A
door to the echo universe. Ready? <br>
EMMA: Ready! <br>
DOCTOR: Geronimo. <br>
(The Doctor leaps into the wormhole. The rope unwinds from the winch.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (So small the bit of ground is only a few metres
deep, and is in black and white. The Doctor removes his harness and
runs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hila? Hila! Hila Tacorian! <br>
(There is the sound of something else in the wood.) <br>
DOCTOR: One, two, three. <br>
(He spins around.) <br>
HILA [OC]: Help me! Help! <br>
(She runs into view.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hila Tacorian, I presume. <br>
HILA: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Collapsing universe. You and me, dead, two minutes. No time
complete sentences. Abandon planet. <br>
HILA: Wait. There's something in the mist. <br>
DOCTOR: Then run. Run! <br>
EMMA [OC]: Doctor! Doctor! Come home! Doctor, come home! <br>
DOCTOR: Not that way, which means, er, probably. <br>
HILA: What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: You know that exit I mentioned? <br>
HILA: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: I seem to have misplaced it. <br>

just top-notch. </font></p>

hammers on it.) <br>

EMMA: I'm sorry. <br>

CLARA: Wasn't enough. She needs to do it again. <br>
PALMER: She can't. Look at her. <br>
CLARA: She has to! We can't leave him. <br>
PALMER: I know that you feel you can't do this, Emma, but look at that
woman over there. You saved her. She's only here because of your
strength, and so am I. </font></p>

HOLO-CLARA: The Tardis Voice Visual Interface. I'm programmed to select
the image of a person you esteem. Of several billion such images in my
databanks, this one best meets the criterion. <br>
CLARA: Oh. Oh, you are a cow. I knew it. Whatever. You have to help the
Doctor. <br>
HOLO-CLARA: The Doctor is in the pocket universe. <br>
CLARA: You can enter the pocket universe. <br>
HOLO-CLARA: The entropy would drain the energy from my heart. In four
seconds, I'd be stranded. In ten, I'd be dead. <br>
CLARA: You're talking, but all I hear is muh muh muh. Come on, let's
go. <br>

EMMA [OC]: Doctor, we're here. Come home. <br>
DOCTOR: Emma? <br>
(Snarl.) <br>
DOCTOR: What do you want? To frighten me, I suppose, eh? Because that's
what you do. You hide. You're the bogeyman under the bed, seeking whom
you may devour. <br>
(Laughter.) <br>
DOCTOR: You want me to be afraid. Then well done. I am the Doctor, and
I am afraid. <br>

(A bizarre quadruped peers round the trunk of a tree.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, you need me to piggyback you across. To which I say, come
on then, big boy, chase me. <br>
(It catches him and knocks him down. Then the Tardis comes whirling
through the air with Clara still screaming. The Doctor runs and grabs
the sill. In the music room, Emma screams and the Tardis materialises
with the Doctor still outside. The morning sun shines in.) </font></p>

EMMA: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: What is she? <br>
EMMA: She's a girl. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but what kind of girl, specifically? <br>
EMMA: She's a perfectly ordinary girl. Very pretty, very clever, more
scared than she lets on. <br>
DOCTOR: And that's it, is it? <br>
EMMA: Why? Is that not enough? </font></p>

EMMA: Where will you go? <br>
HILA: He can't take me home. History says I went missing. <br>
EMMA: But he can change history. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, I can't, actually. There are fixed points in time,
you see <br>
CLARA: Hi. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
(Clara takes the Doctor away.) <br>
HILA: I knew you were there. I could feel you. <br>
EMMA: I know. <br>
HILA: Have we? <br>
EMMA: We can't have. You haven't even been born yet. <br>
DOCTOR: No, you can't have met but she can be your great, great, great,
great, great granddaughter. Yours too, of course. But you guessed that
already, didn't you. Oh. Apparently not. <br>
PALMER: The paradoxes <br>
DOCTOR: Resolve themselves, by and large. That's why the psychic link
was so powerful. Blood calling to blood, out of time. Not everything
ends. Not love. Not always. <br>
PALMER: Doctor, what about, what about us? Emma and me? <br>
DOCTOR: What about you? <br>
PALMER: Well, what's supposed to happen? I mean, what do we do now? <br>
DOCTOR: Hold hands. That's what you're meant to do. Keep doing that and
don't let go. That's the secret. <br>
CLARA [memory]: Doctor! I'm not happy. <br>
DOCTOR [memory]: Yeah, you need me to piggyback you across. <br>
DOCTOR [memory]: I'm not holding your hand. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so slow! I am slow. I'm notorious for it. That's always
been my problem. But, but I get there in the end. Oh yes. <br>
CLARA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: How do sharks make babies? <br>
CLARA: Carefully? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Happily! <br>
CLARA: Sharks don't actually smile. They're just, well, they've got
lots and lots of teeth. They're quite eaty. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. But birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do
it. Every lonely monster needs a companion. <br>
(There is movement at an upper window of the house.) <br>
CLARA: There's two of them? <br>
DOCTOR: It's the oldest story in the universe, this one or any other.
Boy and girl fall in love, get separated by events. War, politics,
accidents in time. She's thrown out of the hex, or he's thrown into it.
Since then they've been yearning for each other across time and space,
across dimensions. This isn't a ghost story, it's a love story! <br>
(Then he realises he has put his arm around Clara's shoulders.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. <br>
(He runs back to Hila, Emma and Palmer.) <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt the rest of your life.
So. Tiny favour to ask. </font></p>

you to her! I can take you to a safe place far away from here! You can
be together! Well, come on, then. She's waiting! <br>

DOCTOR: Well, hello again, you old Romeo, you. Now, here she comes. <br>
