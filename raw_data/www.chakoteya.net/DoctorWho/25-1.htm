<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In Shoreditch in the City of London is a
Secondary School, here played by St Johns Church of England School,
Hammersmith. An elegant woman in a two piece suit walks round the
corner and past a pair of boys kicking a football between them next to
a black van. The rest of the pupils are entering the schoolyard but one
small blonde girl comes out to watch the scene. The Tardis is parked by
a block of flats. The Doctor is walking with Ace, who is carrying a
'ghetto-blaster' on her shoulder, blaring out rock music.) <br>
ACE: What's she staring at? <br>
DOCTOR: Your clothing's a little anachronistic for this time period,
and that doesn't help. <br>
(The Doctor switches off Ace's music.) <br>
ACE: Well, it's not my fault this decade's got no street cred. I mean,
look at that kid. <br>
DOCTOR: Strange. <br>
ACE: Oi, Professor, can we get something to eat now? <br>
(The Doctor looks at the doors to the back of the black van. An aerial
rotates on the roof and there is a distinct humming.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're not carrying any Nitro Nine explosives in there? <br>
ACE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you make of that van? <br>
ACE: Dunno. TV detector van? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Wrong type of aerial. For this time period, that's a very
sophisticated piece of equipment. <br>
ACE: What's so sophisticated about that rig? I've seen better aerials
on a CB. Professor, I'm hungry. Lack of food makes me hungry, you know.
<br>
DOCTOR: Lack of food makes you obstreperous. Why don't you go and buy
some consumables? There's a cafe down there. While I undertake a
detailed and scientific examination of that van that has so singularly
failed to grab your attention. <br>
ACE: Right. <br>
(Ace walks away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ace! <br>
ACE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Money. <br>
ACE: Oh. <br>
(The Doctor holds out a small pouch. Ace takes it.) <br>
ACE: Thanks. <br>
(Ace leaves as the girl watches the Doctor examine the van. <br>
'Return to Sender is playing in the cafe as Ace enters and a young man
in a flying jacket watches her put down the ghetto-blaster and take off
her rucksack. He is reading the Daily Mirror with the headline - Give
Your Passport To Police. Ace goes to the jukebox. <br>
The Doctor climbs up the external ladder to the van roof and uses his
umbrella to measure the length of the moving aerial. The little girl
goes inside the schoolyard.)

ACE: Like what, then? <br>
MIKE: Like this. Oi, Harry! Customer! Like that. <br>
ACE: Right. <br>
HARRY [OC]: Coming. <br>
MIKE: See? It's easy when you know how. <br>
(Harry appears from the kitchen area. The menu is priced in shillings
and pence, and the calendar on the wall is November 1963.) <br>
HARRY: Right, give it a rest, Mike. I had enough of that during the war
Er, can I help you, miss? <br>
ACE: Oh, yeah. Four bacon sandwiches and a cup of coffee, please. <br>
HARRY: Four bacon sandwiches and a cup of coffee. Righty-o. <br>

baffled.)

hopscotch by herself in the middle of four dark patches in the tarmac.)

girl, who runs off.) <br>
DOCTOR: She doesn't talk to strangers. Very wise. <br>

before smiling and leaving. The girl is standing by the Boys entrance.)

her third appearance after 11 years. She finally looks at the Doctor,
who is examining her monitoring equipment.) <br>
DOCTOR: The source of magnetic fluctuation, perhaps. <br>
RACHEL: A rhythmically pulsed fluctuation, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought so. Any possibility of natural phenomena? <br>
RACHEL: Not likely. It's a repeated sequence. <br>
DOCTOR: So, it's artificial in origin. <br>
RACHEL: Yes. Excuse me? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
RACHEL: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor. <br>
RACHEL: I'm Rachel. Professor Rachel Jensen. <br>

ACE: Twelve pennies to the shilling, eight shillings to the pound
right? <br>
MIKE: No, twenty shillings to the pound. That makes two hundred and
forty pennies in a pound. Where are you from anyway? <br>
ACE: Perivale. Why? Oh, this is a stupid system. Twelve pennies to the
shilling, twenty shillings to the pound, right? <br>
MIKE: Yeah. Are you from somewhere else? <br>

ACE: No. So what's half a crown? <br>

MIKE: Military. <br>
POLICEMAN: Fine, sir. <br>
(The policeman signals and Mike sounds the van's horn. They drive
through the crowd into the yard proper. Everyone gets out of the van.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's the situation? <br>
GILMORE: Who the devil are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor and this is Ace. You must be with the military. <br>
GILMORE: Well, how do you know? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm very perceptive. <br>
GILMORE: Is he with you, Professor? <br>
RACHEL: Yes. <br>
GILMORE: Smith. <br>
MIKE: Sir? <br>
GILMORE: Take the girl and set up a position by Red Six. <br>
MIKE: Yes, sir. Come on, Ace. <br>
(Mike and Ace leave.) <br>
GILMORE: You'd better come and take a look. <br>
(The Doctor uncovers Matthews and unfastens his tunic to check his
torso.) <br>
DOCTOR: No evidence of tissue damage. Ah, massive internal
displacement. <br>
GILMORE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: His insides were scrambled. Very nasty. <br>
RACHEL: The effect of the blast? <br>
DOCTOR: No. A projected energy weapon. <br>
GILMORE: Projected what? <br>
RACHEL: A death ray? <br>
DOCTOR: Very succinct. I presume you've got reinforcements coming? <br>
GILMORE: Any minute now. <br>
(The Doctor takes cover behind some metal object.) <br>
GILMORE: This is preposterous. A death ray? It's unbelievable. <br>
DOCTOR: What a predictable response. <br>

SERGEANT: Right, everybody out! Come on, quickly. Move it, move it.
Squad, attention! <br>
GILMORE: Stand at ease. Right, now the situation is this. we have an
armed hostile pegged up in that lean-to shed. I want the squad to cover
the entrance. No firing unless I give the command. Is that understood? <br>
SOLDIERS: Yes, sir. <br>
GILMORE: Remember, he's armed and hostile, so keep under cover as much
as possible. Sergeant. <br>
SERGEANT: Sir. <br>
GILMORE: Detail some men to clear these civilians. <br>
SERGEANT: Yes, sir. You two, come down with me and we'll sort this lot
out. Now, let's have you all back as far as possible, please. Thank
you, madam. There's nothing to be seen here. <br>

GILMORE: Take two men and get Matthews out of here. <br>
MIKE: Yes, sir. You two, fall out and follow me. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think you realise what you're dealing with here. <br>
GILMORE: Doctor, I assure you these men are hand picked. They can deal
with anything, provided they can see it. Right men, take up positions. <br>
(The Doctor joins Ace and Allison at Red 6 while Mike and the soldiers
recover Matthews.) <br>
MIKE: Take his arms. Move him back to the truck. <br>
(Something targets one of the soldiers and zaps him. There is a brief
flash of his skeleton as he is flung back against some corrugated iron
sheeting.) <br>
DOCTOR: Down! <br>
GILMORE: Covering fire now! <br>
(Gilmore and the soldiers take up positions round and under the army
lorry and send short bursts of bullets into the shed. <br>
GILMORE: Cease firing! <br>
(The Doctor and Rachel run over to Gilmore.) <br>
GILMORE: Get down! <br>
RACHEL: What was it? <br>
DOCTOR: That was your death ray. <br>
RACHEL: I know that, but how? To transmit focused energy at that level,
it's incredible. It's <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
RACHEL: It's beyond the realm of current technology. <br>
GILMORE: If you can save the science lecture for a less precipitous
moment. Now perhaps, Doctor, you could tell me what is going on? <br>
DOCTOR: You must pull your men back now. It's their only chance. <br>
GILMORE: It's preposterous. We can't disengage now. Whoever is in
there, my men can handle it. Sergeant! <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me, Brigadier. <br>

DOCTOR: Nothing you possess will be effective against what's in there! <br>

SERGEANT: Yes, sir. <br>

GILMORE: Fire. <br>
DOCTOR: Humans. <br>
SERGEANT: Fire! <br>

ACE: That's some serious hardware. Did you see that, Professor?
Unsophisticated, but impressive. <br>
GILMORE: Smith! <br>
MIKE: Sir? <br>
GILMORE: Get on the radio. Call up Blue Four and Six. Tell Four to pick
up an ambulance on the way. <br>
MIKE: Yes, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter how many men you get here. It isn't going to
make any difference. <br>
GILMORE: Doctor, my men have just put three high-explosive grenades
into a confined area. Nothing even remotely human could have survived
that. <br>

you. <br>
RACHEL: Then what? <br>
GILMORE: I'll meet you back at HQ. Go now, Rachel! <br>

the Dalek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oi, Dalek! It's me, the Doctor. What's the matter? Don't you
recognise your mortal enemy? <br>
(The Dalek reverses to turn and approach the Doctor, who takes the tops
of the cans and puts them by a stack of bricks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Three, four, five, six. <br>

explosion. It is wrecked, and the Doctor is on the ground.) <br>

ACE: Doctor! <br>

DOCTOR: Ace, you said ten seconds. <br>
ACE: Nobody's perfect, Professor. Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I am. Can you drive? <br>
ACE: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Good, I thought so. Get in there. <br>
(The Doctor and Ace get into a black van as everyone else comes over to
investigate their enemy.) <br>
GILMORE: I want an emergency team here at the double. Put a guard on
that thing. Inform command HQ we will be returning there at once. And I
want a weapons team at the Coal Hill School. <br>
MIKE: Sir. <br>

ACE: No, thanks. <br>

Gosh, I remember having to do that.) <br>
MIKE: What do you think you're doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Borrowing your van. <br>

ACE: These Day-leks <br>
DOCTOR: Daleks. <br>
ACE: Oh, Daleks. Where are they from? <br>
DOCTOR: From Skaro. At least, originally. They're the mutated remains
of a species called the Kaleds. Left here. <br>
ACE: When were they left here? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Turn left here. <br>
ACE: Oh, right. <br>
DOCTOR: No, left! You've missed the turning. <br>
ACE: What turn? Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Why don't you concentrate on where you're going? <br>
ACE: Look, I'm doing the best I can. If you don't like it, you drive. <br>
(They drive under a railway arch and suddenly the Doctor and Ace have
swapped places.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Kaleds were at war with the Thals. They had a dirty nuclear
war. The resulting mutations were then accelerated by their chief
scientist, Davros. What he created them he then placed them in a metal
war machine, and that's how the Daleks came about <br>
ACE: So that metal thing had a creature inside controlling it? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. And ever since the Daleks were created, they've tried
to conquer and enslave as much as the universe as they can get their
grubby protuberances on. <br>
ACE: And now they want to conquer the Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing so mundane. They conquer the Earth in the twenty second
century. No. They want the Hand of Omega. <br>
ACE: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: One thing at a time, Ace.

search these localities for any signs of high orbital activity. <br>

the note to him and keeps the pencil, then switches on the light above

Gallifrey. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Boarding house - front room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The doorbell rings.) <br>
MIKE: You stay there. <br>
ACE: It might be the Doctor. Put the gun down, Mike. It's too late for
that. Come on, Mike, who are you going to shoot with it, anyway? <br>
MIKE: Just stay there. <br>
(He goes and opens the front door. It is the little girl. She zaps him
and he is thrown back onto the staircase, dead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside Ratcliffe's yard]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Black Dalek is in the street when the Doctor
and Gilmore arrive in Red 4 from one direction, and the RAF lorry comes
from the other.) <br>
<i> GILMORE: This is the last Dalek left. I'll call for
reinforcements. <br>
DOCTOR: Not this time. I started this. <br>
</i> The Doctor gets out of the van as the little girl
enters the front room and smiles at Ace. He walks down the street
towards the Dalek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Dalek, you have been defeated. Surrender. You have failed. <br>
BLACK: Insufficient data. <br>
DOCTOR: Your forces are destroyed. Your home planet a burnt cinder
circling a dead sun. <br>
BLACK: There is no data. <br>
DOCTOR: Even Davros, your creator, is dead. <br>
(Ace ducks just in time for the little girl to miss her and smash the
mirror instead.) <br>
DOCTOR: You have no superiors, no inferiors, no reinforcement, no hope,
no rescue. <br>
BLACK: You are lying. There is insufficient data. <br>
DOCTOR: You're trapped a trillion miles and a thousand years from a
disintegrated home. <br>
(The Black Dalek starts twirling around, groaning.) <br>
BLACK: Out of control! <br>
DOCTOR: I have defeated you. You no longer serve any purpose. <br>
BLACK: Cannot compute. Unstable. <br>
(The little girl grabs her head and starts swinging back and forth,
squealing.) <br>
BLACK: Unstable. <br>
(The Black Dalek atomises gently.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Boarding house - front room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The little girl collapses. Ace comes out from
behind the sofa to pick her up and hug her.) <br>
ACE: It's all right. Don't worry. It's all over now. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside Ratcliffe's yard]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor prods the smoking remains of the Black
Dalek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cemetery]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The chapel bell tolls and an organ plays as a
coffin is carried in for the service. Group Captain Gilmore escorts Mrs
Smith, with Allison and Rachel behind. The Doctor stops Ace at the
threshold.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time to leave. <br>
ACE: Yes. Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
ACE: We did good, didn't we? <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps. Time will tell. It always does.&nbsp;</font>
