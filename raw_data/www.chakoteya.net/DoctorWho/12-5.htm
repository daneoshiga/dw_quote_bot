they left the Tardis at the second story of the season. They
materialise in the transmat chambers.) <br>
SARAH: Thank heavens for that! We've made it. Haven't we? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course we've made it. Did you think we wouldn't? <br>
SARAH: Well, in these past few weeks, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: There's really nothing that can go wrong with a Time Ring,
except a molecular short circuit. <br>
SARAH: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
SARAH: The Tardis isn't here. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it probably hasn't arrived yet. We're a little early. <br>
HARRY: Hasn't arrived yet? <br>
DOCTOR: No. You see, the Tardis is drifting back through time, Harry.
We just have to wait for it to turn up. <br>
HARRY: I say, Doctor, do you want this Ring thing? <br>
DOCTOR: What, that? <br>
HARRY: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
HARRY: Oh, well, I'd rather like to have it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you take good care of it, Harry. <br>
HARRY: Of course I will. Thank you. <br>
(But as Harry reaches for the Time Ring, it disappears. The Doctor is
grinning.) <br>
HARRY: You knew that was going to happen, didn't you. <br>
(The door to the room opens and a man who had been sitting against it
falls backwards.) <br>
HARRY: He's dead. Been dead some time. <br>
DOCTOR: How long? <br>
HARRY: A week or two, I'd say. There's very little sign of
putrefaction, though. <br>
DOCTOR: Sterile atmosphere. <br>
HARRY: Yes, exactly. And no sign of injury. Nothing to indicate the
cause of death. <br>
SARAH: But he was just sitting against the door as though he'd
collapsed. <br>
DOCTOR: He wouldn't have been left there for two weeks unless <br>
SARAH: Unless what? <br>
DOCTOR: Unless there was something seriously wrong here. Come on. <br>

COLVILLE [OC]: Hello Nerva Beacon, we read you fives clear. Our

WARNER: Pluto Earth flight One Five, ex notice urgent. This beacon is a
quarantine zone. We have a plague infection. I repeat, we have a plague

COLVILLE [OC]: No thanks, Nerva. We got them. How bad are things there?
<br>
WARNER: They're pretty bad. <br>
COLVILLE [OC]: Hello, Nerva, Crewmaster Colville, I say again,
Crewmaster Colville is doing a tour with you. He's my brother. Is he
all right? <br>

What shall I tell him? <br>
STEVENSON [OC]: Tell him Colville's fine, and say that our medical
staff have got the epidemic under control. </font></p>

KELLMAN: Why don't you tell them the truth, Commander? <br>
STEVENSON: I'm just following the orders I was given by Earth Centre. <br>
KELLMAN: Operating the Beacon to the last man? <br>
STEVENSON: If necessary, yes. You're a civilian, Kellman. You wouldn't
understand. <br>
KELLMAN: How much longer can you go on? Three of you doing the work of
fifty men. <br>
LESTER: We've managed for one week, we can manage for another. <br>
KELLMAN: And another after that? No, Lester, this beacon's job is
finished. <br>
STEVENSON: Nerva Beacon has a thirty year assignment, and it'll be that
long before the last inward bound ship has this new asteroid on its
star chart. <br>
LESTER: Until then, there's a constant danger of space collision. <br>
KELLMAN: You deserve a medal for self-sacrifice beyond the bounds of
stupidity. <br>
(Kellman leaves.) <br>
STEVENSON: I've lost most of my crew in these last months, some good
friends among them, and yet a thing like that is still alive. <br>
LESTER: It's probably because he locked himself in that cabin of his at
the first sign of the plague. <br>
(Lester climbs into the bunk vacated by Kellman.) <br>
LESTER: It's only these last few days he's dared poke his nose outside.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Picking their way over more bodies, the Doctor,
Sarah and Harry arrive at a door labelled Q section. It does not open.)
<br>
SARAH: Is it jammed? <br>
DOCTOR: The control's locked. <br>
HARRY: You mean we can't get any further? <br>
DOCTOR: Those poor fellows couldn't. They were trapped in the after end
and left to die. Whatever did it might be on the other side of this
door. There might be a way of opening it. <br>
SARAH: Look, are you sure we're in the right place, Doctor? I mean,
this doesn't look like our Ark. <br>
(The Doctor uses a normal screwdriver on the lock.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well of course it doesn't. This is a different point in time. <br>
SARAH: How can you tell? <br>
DOCTOR: Some of that equipment. This is probably a beacon, put in orbit
to service and guide space freighters. <br>
HARRY: So this is before the time of the solar flares, when the Earth
was evacuated. <br>
DOCTOR: Thousands of years before, Harry. <br>
SARAH: Oh, I'm not even going to think about it. I'll only get a
headache. <br>
DOCTOR: All you have to remember is that this is where we parted
company with the Tardis. <br>
SARAH: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: If they've changed things round, the Tardis might materialise
in the forward control rooms. <br>

Then a voice comes through a lot of static.) <br>

are you reading me? This is Nerva Beacon. </font></p>

ALIEN: Does anybody hear me? Can anyone hear me? Can anyone hear <br>
(The alien with long silver hair and pronounced forehead and cheek
bones throws up his hands as he turns to see two of his species
pointing nasty ray guns at him. Think early Gerry Anderson puppets.) <br>

WARNER: Professor, this new asteroid, this rock or whatever it is, are
you sure there's no life on it? <br>
KELLMAN: On Voga? Of course not, how could there be? <br>
WARNER: I don't know, Professor, but I've just picked up a call and
that's the only place it could have come from. It's the only place near
enough. <br>
KELLMAN: Hallucinations, Warner. You've been sitting here too long. <br>
WARNER: Where did that rock come from, anyway? What system? <br>
KELLMAN: Nobody knows. It was first detected in our system fifty years
ago and it was captured by Jupiter. <br>
WARNER: So there could be life on it. <br>
KELLMAN: Impossible. An asteroid that size, drifting in the vacuum
between star systems? Nothing could have lived under those conditions. <br>
WARNER: All the same, I'd swear that's where the transmission was from.
<br>
KELLMAN: Warner, I'm an exographer. I've been down there. I've set up a
transmat station there. I spent the last six months studying rock
samples from <br>
(Kellman stops Warner from punching some buttons.) <br>
KELLMAN: What are you doing? <br>
WARNER: Logging it. Unidentified call apparently from the direction of
Voga. <br>
(The screen says 18.57hrs Day 3 Week 47. Log unidentified call apparent
direction VOGA.) <br>
KELLMAN: You're mad. I've said all along it was a mistake to keep this
control room operating. <br>
WARNER: Commander Stevenson's decision. Nothing to do with you, is it. <br>
KELLMAN: Every time someone goes down that transom, there's a risk of
spreading the plague. <br>
WARNER: If the Commander says this Beacon is staying operational, it
stays operational. </font></p>

is reaching through to the mechanism on the other side.) <br>
SARAH: Can you reach? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. If you two could put your weight on the door
and stop it opening too suddenly. Don't want to lose my arm. I'm rather
attached to it. It's so handy. <br>
HARRY: Like so? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(The Doctor touches the mechanism and the door slides sideways,
dragging the Doctor with it.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>

it's happened. The information's right here on the electronic register.

LESTER: Everyone in that after section had the plague, so no one can be
left alive. <br>
STEVENSON: Exactly. And the shutters were sealed. They couldn't
possibly be operated from the after section. <br>

VORUS: Bury it deep. Why? <br>
(Another old alien coughs into a yellow handkerchief.) <br>
MAGRIK: Your plan frightened him, Vorus. Sometimes it frightens me.<br>
VORUS: What, would you warn the humans? Do you feel kinship? <br>
MAGRIK: No. No, it's simply that there are so many things which might
go wrong. <br>
VORUS: Of course. It's a big plan. But it will work. You and I
together, Magrik, will make it work. <br>
MAGRIK: Yes, but can we trust our agent? <br>
VORUS: We can trust in his greed. Gold buys humans. And we have more
gold here on Voga than in the rest of the known galaxy. <br>
MAGRIK: But he has not communicated. <br>
VORUS: Better he should not at this time. The Cybermen may be
monitoring our radio frequencies. <br>
MAGRIK: The mention of Cybermen fills me with dread. <br>
VORUS: You feel fear, Magrik, because you've lived for too long in this
underground darkness. When I lead our people into the light, all those
ancient fears will fall away. <br>
MAGRIK: The light. Yes, I believe you, Vorus. </font></p>

with it. <br>

DOCTOR: Who's the homicidal maniac? <br>
STEVENSON: You say you're doctors. Did Earth Centre send you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we're from Earth. We want to help you. <br>
LESTER: Help us? Don't you realise you've brought the infection through
from the after section? <br>
SARAH: Oh don't be ridiculous. How could we have brought it through
when he's infected and we aren't? <br>
HARRY: Quite impossible. We've had no contact with him. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't believe you've got the plague here, Commander. <br>
STEVENSON: According to our own medical team, we have. <br>
DOCTOR: Did they identify it? <br>

STEVENSON: All right, you can examine him. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
STEVENSON: But not here. It'll have to be done in the crew quarters.

Commander? <br>
STEVENSON [on screen]: Can't say that I have. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: They're all over the ship. I've seen them somewhere
before, if I could only remember where. <br>
STEVENSON [on screen]: Is it important? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Everything's important. Well, well, well. <br>
STEVENSON [on screen]: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: I've just made a third interesting discovery about
your plague virus, Commander. <br>
STEVENSON [on screen]: A third? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Yes. One, it scratches metal. Two, it attacks its
victims so suddenly that they become unconscious before they can even
raise the alarm, and three. <br>
STEVENSON [on screen]: Go on. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: It removes tape from radio logs. It must be a very
literate and inquisitive virus. <br>

even launched in 1977, let alone got there in 1979, and the writer
possibly didn't know about Leda being discovered in 1974. Stevenson
puts an image of the asteroid on the monitor.) <br>
STEVENSON: Turned up fifty years ago. That's why this beacon's out
here. A lot of the Great Circle freighters haven't got it on their
charts yet. <br>
DOCTOR: What's it called? <br>
STEVENSON: New Phobos, originally, but Kellman's renamed it Voga. <br>
DOCTOR: Voga. Of course. Has he been down there? <br>

DOCTOR: Voga. Voga. Planet of gold. Yes, it's all coming back to me

STEVENSON: What's coming back to you? <br>
DOCTOR: Cybermen. That's what we're up against, Commander. Cybermen. <br>
STEVENSON: But surely, Doctor, Cybermen died out centuries ago. <br>
DOCTOR: They disappeared after their attack on Voga at the end of the
Cyber War. Not the same thing as dying out, Commander. They're utterly
ruthless. Total machine creatures. <br>

and follows. Kellman switches off his little monitor and gets a larger
transmitter from his desk drawer. He plugs it into a wall power unit

sycophantinous city. <br>
TYRAM: As leader of the Guardians, you abused your trust. You opened
the route to the surface. You made clandestine contact with aliens, and
you beamed radio transmissions out into space. There are no greater
crimes in our calendar. <br>
VORUS: In your calendar, Tyram! Your cowering, furtive, underworld
life. If we survive, I will face trial gladly. I will give the people
my reasons. I wanted to free them from this tyranny of dark, living
rock. <br>
TYRAM: Living the way we had for generations, at least we were safe,
Vorus. Safe from the genocidal threat of the Cybermen. <br>
VORUS: I had a dream. <br>
TYRAM: A folly, conceived out of arrogance through overweening
ambition. <br>
VORUS: We could have traded with other worlds, exchanged our gold for
armaments. We could have been strong enough to defend ourselves against
Cybermen or any other attackers. <br>

Cybermen myself. <br>
TYRAM: Yourself? You mean, alone? <br>
DOCTOR: Give me just fifteen minutes. If at the end of that time I
haven't come through on the radio, well then you can fire off your

TYRAM: You've already done so much. Why should you risk your life again
in this way? <br>

here. She risked her life to save mine. The least I can do is accept
the same risk for her. <br>
