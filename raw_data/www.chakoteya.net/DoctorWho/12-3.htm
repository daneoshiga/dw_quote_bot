<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A number of globes nestle amongst the heather of
Headland Warren, Dartmoor, just north of Widecombe. They buzz, then the
Doctor appears. He has just transported down from Space Station Nerva,
the Ark in Space. After a few moments, Harry appears, disappears, and
appears in another place.) <br>
HARRY: Ah, Doctor. <br>
(Harry disappears again, then finally reappears.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you coming, or going? Or going or coming? <br>
HARRY: I feel a bit like a Morse message. Slightly scrambled. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, let's get on with it. These must be the refractors. <br>
HARRY: Er, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
HARRY: I can see you're busy, but what about Sarah? <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah? <br>
SARAH [OC]: Help! <br>
DOCTOR: That sounds like Sarah. <br>
SARAH: Help me! <br>
(A pair of legs in bright water-proofs are waving amongst the heather.
The Doctor listens to a globe.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not only oscillating, it's ellipsing as well. You'd better
give her a hand, Harry. <br>
HARRY: Righty-o. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, I see the problem. Focus gone a bit fuzzy. <br>
(A little way away, Harry pulls Sarah up onto her feet.) <br>
HARRY: Okay, old thing? <br>
SARAH: Harry, I'm not a thing. <br>
HARRY: The Doctor says it's the refractors. <br>
SARAH: Is it? Ow. <br>
HARRY: I say, you're not hurt, are you? <br>
SARAH: Only in my dignity. <br>
(They walk back to the transmat circle.) <br>
SARAH: Ahem. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Sarah. You're looking well. Look, er, it's going to take
some time to do the whole lot. Why don't you two make the most of it? <br>
SARAH: Make the most of what? <br>
DOCTOR: Glorious day. Beautiful unspoilt countryside. No one's set foot
here for thousands of years. <br>
SARAH: What you're trying to say is that you're busy and you'd like us
to push off. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd phrase it more elegantly myself, of course. Yes. <br>
HARRY: Oh well, might as well have a recce while we're here. Coming old
thing? Coming, Sarah? <br>
DOCTOR: Enjoy yourselves. Trafalgar Square should be that way. <br>
(The Doctor points in the opposite direction to where they're going.) <br>
SARAH: Trafalgar Square? <br>
DOCTOR: If this is Piccadilly. <br>
SARAH: You're joking. Aren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Mind the traffic. <br>

SARAH: Trafalgar Square, my foot. Not a pigeon in sight.&nbsp;<br>
HARRY: Well, I don't suppose many of our feathered friends survived,
you know. Not much in the way of life, is there. <br>
SARAH: It's rather creepy. Doesn't seem like Earth at all. <br>
HARRY: Oh, I don't know. Nice and tidy, anyway. No lolly sticks. <br>
SARAH: It's not what I expected. <br>
HARRY: Well, it'll all change when they get down from Nerva. Their
animal botanic section's packed with stuff. <br>
SARAH: What's that? <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
SARAH: Shush. Listen. <br>
HARRY: I can't hear anything. <br>
(There's a whirring sound, and something moves just below the ridge
above them.) <br>
SARAH: It's over there. <br>
HARRY: Oh, come on, Sarah. You're imagining things. Look, Sarah,
there's been no life on Earth, not of any size, for ten thousand years.
<br>
SARAH: Now look, we don't know that, do we? There could be anything
here. <br>
HARRY: Such as what? <br>
SARAH: I don't know. Mutations, creatures? <br>
HARRY: Come on.

waist.) <br>
ERAK: Krans! Krans! I've seen some guy. A stranger. <br>
KRANS: What? <br>
ERAK: Zake's watching him, down by that circle. I thought maybe Vural
ought to know. <br>
KRANS: No, no, no, he's out looking for grub. Down by the circle, eh? <br>
ERAK: Yeah. Hey, could be it's something to do with this mess, eh? <br>
KRANS: Well, we'll soon find out.

HARRY: No bones broken, I don't think. All the same, I'm stuck, aren't
I? <br>
(Sarah calls down to him.) <br>
SARAH: Harry! Harry, there's something wrong here. The edge of this
hole's been covered. <br>
HARRY: Of course it has. That's why I fell. Oh, I see what you mean. A
deliberate trap, eh? <br>
SARAH: Shush. I'm going to fetch the Doctor. <br>

heather, rounding up Zake and following him as he runs away. The Doctor
continues working, unaware. Zake runs to the edge of a cliff, and falls
over it. The Doctor hears his scream.) <br>

KRANS: Cut him loose, Erak, but leave his hands tied, eh. <br>
(Erak uses his big blade to cut the ropes around the Doctor's legs.
Krans comes down with a piece of white hot wood from the fire.) <br>
KRANS: All right, now talk. <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly. What would you like me to talk about? <br>

the pit. She hears that whirring sound again. Meanwhile, Harry has
found that his hole is a tunnel that brings him out below Hound Tor, a
magnificent piece of weather-carved granite. Sarah lowers the tree into
the pit to act as a ladder. Someone creeps up behind her and puts his
hand over her mouth, then drags her away from the edge to cover. The
contraption trundles up, stops and scans, then leaves.) <br>
SARAH: What on Earth? <br>
ROTH: Shush! <br>
(He checks that the coast is clear.) <br>
ROTH: Who are you? Where are you from? <br>
SARAH: That's what I was going to ask you. Okay, my name is Sarah.
What's yours? <br>
ROTH: Sarah. <br>
SARAH: What's you name? <br>
ROTH: Roth. <br>
SARAH: Do you live here, Roth? No, those are space clothes, aren't
they? <br>
(Roth goes to the edge of the pit.) <br>
ROTH: I covered this, you understand, to catch the machine. <br>
SARAH: Tell me about the machine. <br>
ROTH No! <br>
SARAH: Why are you so frightened of it? <br>
ROTH: The machines serves him. Captures my crewmates. <br>
SARAH: Serves who? <br>
ROTH: The thing in the rocks. I'll not get caught. No, not again. <br>
SARAH: No, wait. What thing in the rocks? <br>
ROTH: The alien in the rocks. The machine captures us, takes us for
torture. I got away, see? <br>
(He shows Sarah a scar on his forearm.) <br>
SARAH: Those are burns, aren't they? Did the alien do that? Is that
what you're saying? <br>
ROTH: He killed Heath and Splier. I got away. Understand? <br>
SARAH: I think I'm beginning to. Look, take me to these rocks. <br>
ROTH: No! <br>
SARAH: Oh look, Roth, you've got to help me. I came here with two
friends and they've both vanished, understand? I mean, you understand? <br>
ROTH: I saw them. <br>
SARAH: Then it was you following us? <br>
ROTH: One of your friends is with Vural. <br>
SARAH: Vural? <br>
ROTH: He was in the circle. I saw them take him. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: I told you, I just got here. <br>
ERAK: How, eh? We've seen no ship. <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't use one. I came by transmat beam. <br>
VURAL: That's a lie. <br>
DOCTOR: That's the truth. Who are you? <br>
VURAL: Vural. I'm the leader of this party. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
VURAL: Where'd you find him? <br>
ERAK: First saw him creeping about that circle. <br>
DOCTOR: Not creeping. I was repairing the <br>
KRANS: Shut up! By the time we caught up with him, he was bent over
Zake. <br>
KRANS: He killed him. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd not kill him. I heard a cry and found him with his neck
broken in a gully. An accident, I imagine. <br>
VURAL: You say you came here by transmat beam? <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. <br>
VURAL: There's no transmat beam on this planet. The Earth's been
junked. <br>
DOCTOR: Temporarily abandoned perhaps, but not junked. Oh, no. <br>
VURAL: It's worn out, useless, and too far from the freight routes.
Nobody comes here so there's no transmat beam. Check? <br>
KRANS: Check. <br>
VURAL: So you better start telling the truth or you night find things
getting a little rough. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to keep contradicting you, but there is a transmat
beam from Space Station Nerva. <br>
KRANS: From where? <br>
DOCTOR: Space Station Nerva. <br>
ERAK: Is he crazy? <br>
KRANS: A joker. <br>
VURAL: You don't expect us to believe that. <br>
DOCTOR: Nerva, transmat beam, Earth. It's as simple as that. Why don't
you believe me? <br>
VURAL: Because Nerva doesn't exist, that's why. There's no such place. <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating. You don't believe it exists, yet you've obviously
heard of it. <br>
KRANS: Everybody's heard of the lost colony. <br>
DOCTOR: Lost colony? Ah. You mean it's become a legend like lost
Atlantis? <br>
ERAK: Like what? <br>
DOCTOR: Lost Atlantis. It's a legendary city. A go, never mind. This is
extremely interesting. Are you going to cut me loose? <br>
VURAL: No, we're going to get the truth out of you first. <br>
KRANS: Too right. <br>
DOCTOR: Very colonial. You are from a colony, I take it? <br>
VURAL: GalSec. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, on Nerva, they know that various colony ships left
Earth. They'll be delighted to know that they're not the sole survivors
of the human race. You are human? <br>
KRANS: What do you mean? <br>
ERAK: Of course we are. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no offence, no offence. Do you mind if I take a close look
at that? <br>
(The Doctor peers at a small metal stud on the front of Vural's
spacesuit. Our viewpoint switches to the Doctor's face on a screen
somewhere.) <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: I' d say it's not a product of human technology,
eh, Vural? <br>
VURAL [OC]: You're a freak! <br>
(A hand with massive nails presses a couple of buttons and the
contraption rises up from the heather where it has been hiding, scans
and heads off. A little while later, the men are eating as the Doctor
sits just down the slope.) <br>
ERAK: I say let's get rid of him now and save ourselves the trouble
later. <br>
VURAL: Krans? <br>
KRANS: If he had landed by ship we'd have heard. Maybe he did come by
transmat beam. <br>
ERAK: From Nerva? <br>
KRANS: Maybe. <br>
VURAL: Aye, I remember the old story. Back in the days of the
expansion, a bunch of survival sleepers went to Space Station Nerva to
wait for the Earth to cool down again. <br>
ERAK: So? Earth's cooled down and they've never come back. And Nerva's
never been found. It's just a story. <br>
VURAL: Yeah. I reckon if it ever existed, it got burnt up in the
sunbursts. <br>
KRANS: You know what makes me half believe him? It's such a crazy
story, that's what. <br>
ERAK: You mean, if he was making it up, he'd think of something better?
<br>
KRANS: Check. <br>
ERAK: Never. <br>
KRANS: I'll question him again. <br>
VURAL: No. I'll handle this.

SARAH: Look, Roth, if you're in Vural's crew, why are you so frightened
of him? <br>

SARAH: What do you mean, you saw? <br>

freeze on Nerva? <br>
DOCTOR: Ohm ten thousand years? <br>
VURAL: And you woke up before the others? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no. I'm a sort of travelling time expert. As you can see,
Earth's been habitable for several thousand years, but they didn't wake
up. Why? Clock stopped. Overslept. So here I am. <br>
VURAL: Clock expert? <br>
DOCTOR: Horologist, actually. And chronometrist. I just love clocks.
Atomic clocks, wall quartz clocks, grandfather clocks <br>
ERAK: He's still lying. <br>
VURAL: Shut up, Erak. <br>
DOCTOR: Cuckoo clocks. <br>
VURAL: You got any proof? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no, but then I didn't expect to meet anyone. I understood
Earth wasn't inhabited. <br>
KRANS: Yes, that's what we thought until we got a distress call from
around here. <br>
DOCTOR: A mayday? Then you're a military expedition, I take it. <br>
VURAL: One of our GalSec freighters went missing. We er, we picked up a
distress call and came down for a look-see. Soon as we stepped from the
ship it was vapourised. Nine of us were stuck here. <br>
DOCTOR: Nine? Where are the rest? <br>
VURAL: Vanished. <br>
ERAK: And we reckon that that circle of yours has got something to do
with it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish. That's just the reception point for the transmat
beam. <br>
(Sarah's head peeps over a rock behind the men.) <br>
ERAK: Let's kill him now and get it over with. <br>
KRANS: No. <br>
DOCTOR: That’s wild talk, Erak. Far from killing me, you should treat
me as an honoured guest. <br>
KRANS: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you don't want to be stuck here forever, do you. <br>
VURAL: Go on. <br>
DOCTOR: I might consider helping you. <br>
VURAL: How do you reckon to help us? <br>
DOCTOR: Simple. I finish refocusing the matter beam then we all pop up
to Nerva, you get in touch with your headquarters and they send a ship
for you. <br>
VURAL: Listen. If you are one of the Old People, we’re not taking
orders from your lot. While you were dozing away, our people kept going
and they made it. We’ve got bases all across the galaxy now. You’ve
done nothing for ten thousand years while we made an Empire. You
understand? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. <br>
VURAL: We’re not taking any of that Mother Earth rubbish! <br>
KRANS: Hey, look! It’s Roth. <br>
ERAK: Hey, Rothy! Hey! Hey, Rothy! <br>

KRANS: It is Roth! Come on! Hey! <br>
VURAL: Roth! <br>
(Krans and Vural run off too. Sarah comes out of hiding and uses Erak's
discarded sword to cut the Doctor free.) <br>
ERAK [OC]: Hey! Roth! <br>
DOCTOR: Good girl, Sarah. Who’s your fast friend? <br>
SARAH: Come on, Doctor, I'll explain later. <br>
(Sarah and the Doctor run up into the rocks.) <br>
VURAL: Roth! Roth! <br>
ERAK: I've got cramps. He’s bunked. <br>
KRANS: I saw him, plain as daylight. <br>
VURAL: Now why’d he run like that? Why’d he run from us? <br>
ERAK: He must have gone bush. <br>

ERAK: That freak. He's got away. <br>

terullian to be found in this galaxy. <br>
ROTH: Ja, ja, alien. Alien, you understand? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, don't you worry about it, old chap. He's half demented
with shock. <br>
SARAH: He's been tortured, badly by the look of it. He's terrified of
everyone now, especially his old crewmates. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I can't say I blame him for being wary of friend
Vural, at any rate. You know, it's absolutely typical of Harry! How
anyone in his proper mind could fall down a whacking great subsidence
like. That's it! <br>
SARAH: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: Subsidence! A sewer or something. Maybe it's the Central Line. <br>
SARAH: I'm not with you. <br>
DOCTOR: I mean here must be some way out at the bottom. Hang on, Sarah.
I'll just go down and take a look. <br>
SARAH: Hey, you be careful, Doctor. If you break a leg or something,
we'll never get you out. <br>

Baker broke his collar bone?) <br>

climbs up through the granite rocks at the top of Hound Tor and starts
down the other side. He ducks down into hiding when he spots a circular
spaceship of a style we first saw over a season ago in Mediaeval
England. Later, water dripping onto the Doctor's face wakes him.) <br>

century. You were blown to smithereens. <br>

you will address me, of the Sontaran G3 Military Assessment Survey. And
your opinion of my looks is of no interest to my programme. <br>
(Styre speaks into a dictaphone.) <br>
STYRE: Female number one, first assessment. Would appear to have no
military justification. Offensive value therefore nil. <br>
ROTH: You won't get me. You won't torture me again. <br>
(Roth starts to run away, and Styre shoots him with his red-beam hand
weapon. Sarah screams.) <br>
STYRE: Why did you make that disagreeable noise? <br>

STYRE: That is my function. I am a warrior. <br>

already used up five of them and I have been studying the free
behaviour patterns of the remaining four. <br>
SARAH: So? <br>
STYRE: So it is useless lying to me. I know you were not on that GalSec
ship. Where do you come from? What is your planet of origin? <br>
SARAH: Earth. <br>
STYRE: That is a lie. There has been no intelligent life on this planet
since the time of the solar flares. <br>

STYRE: I have the reports. <br>
SARAH: They can't be wrong, can they? <br>

and must therefore be eliminated. According to my data you should not
exist. <br>

Harry, who has got himself a very large stick, hides from him.
Meanwhile, the Doctor has followed the tunnel out to below the other
side of the Tor, just like Harry did.) <br>

MARSHAL [on monitor]: Well, Styre? <br>
STYRE: My report, Marshal. <br>
MARSHAL [on monitor]: Get on with it, then. <br>
STYRE: As we knew, the Earth has not been repopulated. I have therefore
carried out my instructions and lured a group of humans to the planet
for testing. The results of my experiment indicate that they are puny
beings with little resistance to physical stress, and are totally
dependent on organic chemical intake for their energy supply. <br>
MARSHAL [on monitor]: Thank you, Styre. Then your report is complete. <br>
STYRE: Not quite, Marshal. <br>
MARSHAL [on monitor]: Why must there be any delay? <br>
STYRE: Some inconsistencies have arisen. Small mistakes that will soon
be eliminated. My final intelligence report for the assault will be
with you within the hour, Marshal. <br>

back again, and it is gone. Then she thinks the rocks are about to fall
on her, and she screams. Next is mud creeping up over her legs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah! Listen to me, Sarah! It's not real. Do you understand?
Nothing is happening to you. It's only in your mind. <br>
(The Doctor uses his screwdriver on a plate fastened to a rock. It
melts.) <br>
DOCTOR: Fight it, Sarah. Fight it. <br>

from her forehead. She screams and passes out.) <br>

easily thrown off.) <br>
STYRE: Words, Earthling, will never prevail against Sontaran might. <br>
DOCTOR: Why did you do it to her? <br>
STYRE: I did nothing. I merely resurrected those things which lay
buried in the depths of her pathetic little mind. She was a victim of
her own fear. And now, your turn. <br>

ERAK: Why you stinking, lousy swine, Vural! You tried to do a deal with
this thing? <br>

STYRE: Field Major Styre, Sontaran G3 Military Assessment Survey.
Experiment five, human resistance to fluid deprivation. Data, subject
died after nine days, seven hours. Impairment of mental faculties,
motor reflexes and physical coordination noted after only three days.
Conclusion, dependence on fluid is a significant weakness which should
be exploited in our attack. As a rider to the above, we should also
like to take into account the successful conclusion of experiment four,
where immersion in the fluid H2O produced asphyxiation in less than
three minutes. <br>
(During this speech, Harry started to creep up on Styre, but the Doctor
put his hand over his mouth then beckoned him away.) <br>
STYRE: Conclusion, this species has little resistance to immersion in
liquids. <br>
(Further away.) <br>
HARRY: Doctor, I thought you were both dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Not me. Piece of the synestic locking mechanism from Nerva's
rocket. Popped it in my pocket. <br>
HARRY: Fortuitous. <br>
DOCTOR: Foresight. You never know when these bits and pieces will come
in handy. <br>
(He throws it away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Never throw anything away, Harry. Where's my five hundred year
diary? I remember jotting some notes on the Sontarans. It's a mistake
to clutter one's pockets, Harry. <br>
HARRY: Yes, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What's Styre doing here? <br>
HARRY: Well, he's killing people. He's on some kind of ghastly
experiment. Look what he's done to Sarah. <br>
DOCTOR: Harry, Sontarans never do anything without a military reason.
You look to Sarah. <br>
HARRY: And what are you going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Find out what's behind all this. <br>

fastened down on a flat rock while Erak and Krans hold a large weight
over him.) <br>
STYRE: Experiment eight, resistance to pressure on the human breast
cage and muscular strength. Are you prepared? <br>
ERAK: What are you up to, you lump of filth? <br>
STYRE: You are holding a gravity bar. At the moment it is a mere forty
pounds Earth weight. I will increase that weight to two hundred pounds.

SARAH: They're going to invade Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: The entire galaxy suddenly acquired some strategic importance
in their endless war against the Rutans. <br>
HARRY: Why on Earth is Styre torturing people? <br>
DOCTOR: He's making an assessment of human physical limitations.
Sontarans are very methodical people, and that might give us a slight
advantage. <br>
HARRY: Oh, I hadn't noticed, frankly. <br>

DOCTOR: Sontarans never turn down the chance to kill someone. <br>
SARAH: Well you're not going to let him kill you? <br>
DOCTOR: I hope not. I'm going to try and tire him out. He's pretty
unwieldy, for all his strength, and he's not used to Earth's gravity.
The thing is, if I can get him exhausted, he'll have to go back to his
ship to reenergise. Are you with me? <br>

to hold the massive weight.) <br>

DOCTOR: Still about your butcher's ways, Styre? <br>
STYRE: You? But I killed you. <br>
DOCTOR: Another mistake, Styre. You've fallen right into our trap. <br>
STYRE: Trap? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Those people you've been so cleverly evaluating are not
Earth warriors. They're our slave class, the lowest form of human
intelligence. <br>
STYRE: You lie! <br>
DOCTOR: Do you think those puny creatures could conquer half a galaxy?
No, Styre, I represent the true warrior class. Evaluate me if you dare.

(Styre draws his weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Is that the Sontaran way? The mighty warrior sheltering
behind his gun? I challenge you, Styre. Single combat. Or are you
afraid? <br>
STYRE: Afraid? A Sontaran afraid? <br>
(Styre throws down his gun and picks up one of the Earth men's knives.)

STYRE: All right, come to your death! <br>

Doctor easily dodging Styre's swings. Meanwhile, Harry and Sarah go to
help Krans and Erak move the gravity bar away from Vural. The Doctor

the Doctor's stick in half, and makes to leave.) <br>

a lot of smoke. He collapses as the ship makes an increasingly
high-pitched noise, then his head and body collapses in on itself like
a punctured balloon. The spaceship goes KaBOOM! leaving nothing
behind.) <br>
SARAH: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Ask Harry, he did it. <br>
HARRY: What did I do? What is this thing anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a sort of terullian diode bypass transformer. <br>
HARRY: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Sontarans, as I told you, sometimes need to feed on pure
energy, and by removing that you altered things slightly, and the
energy fed on him. <br>
HARRY: That's taken care of one of them, but what about the rest of the
