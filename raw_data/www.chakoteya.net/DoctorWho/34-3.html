up on the
gallery, near his bookcase. Clara is down by the console, swivelling in
his easy chair.)<br>
DOCTOR: Take a punt.
<br>
CLARA:&nbsp;Right.
<br>
DOCTOR: Your choice. Wherever, whenever, anywhere in time and space.
<br>
CLARA: Well, there is something, someone that I've always wanted to
meet.
But I know what you'll say.
<br>

Try me.

You'll say he's made up, that there is no such thing.

Go on.

It's. It's Robin Hood.
<br>
DOCTOR: Robin Hood.
<br>
(Clara goes up to the gallery.)<br>
CLARA: Yeah. I love that story. I've always loved it, ever since I was
little.
<br>
DOCTOR: Robin Hood, the heroic outlaw, who robs from the rich and gives
to the
poor.
<br>
CLARA: Yeah.
<br>
DOCTOR: He's made up. There's no such thing.
<br>
CLARA: Ah, you see? <br>
(The Doctor takes a book from the bookcase.)
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Old-fashioned heroes only exist in old-fashioned story books, Clara.

And what about you?

Me?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Yeah, you. You stop bad things happening every minute of every day.
That sounds pretty heroic to me.

(The Doctor licks something from a large metal spoon. Custard?)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Just passing the time. Hey, what about Mars?

What?!<br>

Very well.

(He sets the coordinates.)<br>
DOCTOR: Earth. England. Sherwood Forest. 1190AD. Ish.&nbsp;But
you'll only be
disappointed.
<br>
(</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He sets the Tardis flying. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile,
the first Doctor is meeting Richard the Lionheart at the Crusades.)<br>
<br>
<b>[By a stream]</b><br>
<br>
(The birds are singing, and a long tree trunk has been placed
across the stream to act as a bridge. The Tardis materialises slightly
up the slope and the Doctor steps out.)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
No damsels in distress, no pretty castles, no such thing as Robin Hood.<br>
(An
arrow slams into the Tardis next to him. A figure in dressed in Lincoln
Green pops up from behind a tree trunk on the other side of the
stream.)
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
You called?
(and winks.) Very, very nicely done with the box, sir. I saw a Turk
perform
something very similar at Nottingham Fayre. <br>
(The Doctor pulls the arrow out, and the hole vanishes.)<br>
ROBIN: It's a trick with mirrors,
no doubt?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
A trick?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
A good jest. Ha, ha!<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
This is not a trick. This is a Tardis.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Whatever it is, you bony rascal, I'm afraid I must relieve you of it.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
It's my property, that's what it is.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Well, don't you know all property is theft to Robin Hood?
<br>
(Robin stands in the middle of the 'bridge' without his bow and arrows.)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
You're not serious.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm many
things, sir, but I'm never that. Robin Hood laughs in the face
of all.
Ha, ha, ha.<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
And do people ever punch you in the face when you do that?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Not as yet.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Lucky I'm here then, isn't it?
<br>
(Clara comes out of the Tardis, dressed in a red medieval-style
dress, with long cut-away sleeves and a thin girdle around her hips.
There is also a silver rope across her forehead that stays in place as
if glued there.)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Might be a little bit much, but what do you reckon, Doctor?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
By all the saints. Are there any more in there?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Is that?
<br>
DOCTOR: No.
<br>
CLARA: Oh, my God. Oh, my God! It is, isn't it? You found him. You
actually
found Robin Hood.
<br>
(Clara goes very girlish and giggly.)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
That is not Robin Hood.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Well then, who, sir, is about to relieve you of your magic box?
<br>
(Robin draws his long sword. The Doctor walks onto the bridge.)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Nobody, sir. Not in this universe or the next.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Well then, draw your sword and prove your words.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
I have no sword. I don't need a sword. <br>
(The Doctor opens his coat and turns to prove it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Because I am the Doctor. <br>
(He dons a gauntlet.)<br>
DOCTOR: And
this is my spoon.
En garde!
<br>
(They trade thrusts and parries. The spoon stands up to the sword
very well. The Doctor hits Robin on the back of the neck as he passes
him.)<br>
ROBIN: Ow!
<br>
CLARA: You're amazing.
<br>
DOCTOR: I've had some experience. Richard the Lionheart. Cyrano de
Bergerac.
Errol Flynn. He had the most enormous <br>
CLARA: Ahem.<br>
DOCTOR: Ego.
<br>
CLARA: Takes one to know one.<br>
(The Doctor slaps Robin's backside.)<br>
ROBIN:&nbsp;Oh, you. <br>
(And
retaliates by cutting a button off the Doctor's coat. So the Doctor
holds his arms wide open and Robin lunges with his sword. The Doctor
deflects it and does a little&nbsp;turn so that he and
Robin are back to back on the trunk. Then he sticks out his bottom and
pushes Robin into the water. Splash!) <br>
CLARA: Doctor!
<br>
(The Doctor polishes his spoon.)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Like I said. My box.
<br>
CLARA: Doctor?
<br>
(They look into the water. Robin is not visible. Because he pops up
behind the Doctor and pushes him into the water. Clara and Robin laugh.)<br>
<b><br>
[Settlement]<br>
<br>
</b>(A few thatched wattle-and-daub buildings, and a Celtic
cross on a plinth. Knights in full armour are making the
chickens scatter. A young woman is being dragged away&nbsp;chained
to yoke across her shoulders. An old
man runs up.)<br>
QUAYLE: In the name of all that's holy, take our money, take our
treasure, but
spare my ward.<br>
QUAYLES WARD: Do not fuss. All will be well.
<br>
QUAYLE: This is the Sheriff's doing.
If he were here now, I'd tear out his black heart! <br>
(A figure back-lit sitting on a horse speaks.)<br>
SHERIFF: Would you now?
<br>
(He dismounts.)<br>
SHERIFF: Or are you as milk-livered as your name suggests, Master
Quayle?
<br>
QUAYLE: Take me. Spare this dear child.
<br>
SHERIFF: Take you? A lardy lack-wit like you? It's labour we require up
at the
castle. Labour and gold. Not old men and their worthless baubles. This
will be a great help, Master Quayle, believe me. Newcomer to Sherwood,
are we?
<br>
QUAYLES WARD: Yes, my Lord.
<br>
SHERIFF: You may also prove useful. Bring her.
<br>
QUAYLE: Your days are numbered, you cur.
<br>
(Quayle spits in the Sheriff's face.)<br>
SHERIFF: You shall live to regret that. Actually, no. You won't.
<br>
(The Sheriff stabs Quayle in the stomach.)<br>
QUAYLES WARD:&nbsp; No! No!

narrow gullly.The outlaws live in shallow caves under the treeline.

2, with Clara as Bob.)<br>
ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let me introduce you to my men. This is Will
Scarlet.
He is a cheeky
rogue with a good sword arm and a slippery tongue.
<br>
WILL: My lady.

(The Doctor pulls some of his hair out as he bows, and scans it with
the sonic screwdriver.)<br>
WILL: Argh! What do you want with my hair?

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Well, it's realistic, I'll give you that.

And this is Friar Tuck. Aptly named for the amount of grub he tucks
into.<br>
TUCK: You skinny blackguard.

TUCK: What are you doing?
<br>
(The Doctor stands up with one of his sandals)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

brightens
up these dark days.

ALAN: (sings) Stranger you are welcome here, in Sherwood's bonny glade.

Sorry, sorry, sorry. Blood analysis. Oh. All those diseases. If you

is John Little. Called Little John. He's my loyal companion

merriment.)<br>

WILL: Works every time.<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oh, I

Stop laughing. Why are you always doing that? Are you all simple or
something? I'm going to need a sample.

walking up to Robin..)<br>
ROBIN: Of what?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: Ahem.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excuse

Well, they're not holograms, that much is obvious. Could be a theme

You said that these were dark days. What did you mean?

rules
instead.

And the Sheriff. Cos there is a sheriff, right? <br>
ALAN: Aye.
It is indeed this jackal of the princes who seeks to oppress us for
ever more.

Or six months in your case.

beauty
here. <br>

you so sad?

I er, I had my lands and titles stripped from me. I dared to speak
out against Prince John. But I lost the thing most dear to me.

What was she called?

You know her?

I have always known her.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
It was Marian who told me that I must stand up and be counted. But, I
was afraid. Now this green canopy is my palace and the rough ground my
feather bed. Maybe one day I will return home, but until that day.
Until that day, it is beholden on me to be the man Marian wanted, to be
a hero for those this tyrant sheriff slaughters.

What time is it, Mister Hood?

Somewhat after noon.

Oh, Dame Autumn has draped her mellow skirts about the forest, Doctor.
The time of mists and harvest approaches.

Yeah, yeah. All very poetic. But it's very green hereabouts, though,

I said, very sunny.

You must excuse me. The Sheriff has issued a proclamation and tomorrow
there is to be a contest to find the best archer in the land. And the
bounty, it's an arrow made of pure gold.

Don't, don't go. It's a trap.

Well, of course it is!&nbsp;But a contest to find the best archer

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right,
that isn't even funny. That was bantering. I am totally against
bantering.

How can you be so sure he is not the real thing?

Because he can't be.

CLARA: When did you stop believing in everything?

DOCTOR: When did you start believing in impossible heroes?

Don't you know? In a way, it's rather sweet.

its artificial lakes, which was built from 1268 onwards. Nottingham
Castle is built on castle rock by the river with the city around it.
The contest is taking place in the central ward.)<br>
HERALD: In the contest for the golden arrow, after ten rounds,
the battle is
betwixt our Lord Sheriff
<br>
(Obligatory cheers from the crowd.)<br>
HERALD: And the stranger known as Tom the Tinker.
<br>
(Robin in a wide-brimmed leather hat gets a rousing reception.)<br>
SHERIFF: Perhaps not such a stranger after all.
<br>
HERALD: Take your places.<br>
ROBIN: Shall we make the contest a little more interesting, my Lord?
The
targets seem a little close. What say you? Another twenty paces?
<br>
SHERIFF: Why not?
<br>
(The central target is moved back. The Sheriff fires his black arrow
into the middle of the bulls-eye.)<br>
SHERIFF: Now, Tinker. Let us see thy true face. <br>
(Robin's white-fletched arrow splits the Sheriff's.)<br>
HERALD: Ye Gads! He has split the arrow! Truly, he is the finest archer
in all
England. Come forward, Tinker. And claim your prize.

(His lute is snatched from him.)<br>
WILL: Give it a rest, Alan.
<br>
ALAN: Give me my lute!
<br>
CLARA: Still not keen on the laughing thing?
<br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no.
<br>
(Clara laughs. Robin laughs.)<br>
<br>
<b>[By a stream]<br>
<br>
</b>(Robin gives Clara a very personal archery lesson.)<br>
CLARA: Woo-hoo! I'm going to miss you.
You're very naughty.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oh, I
know.
Whoever he is, he is a very lucky man.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marian
is very lucky, too.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I fear
not.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't
give up. Not ever. Not for one single day. <br>
(She kisses his cheek.)<br>
CLARA: Be safe, if you can
be. But always be amazing.
<br>
ROBIN: Hmm. <br>
CLARA: Goodbye, Robin Hood.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goodbye,
Clara Oswald.
<br>
(Clara winks at him, then goes into the Tardis.)<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, is
it true, Doctor?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is what
true?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That in
the future I am forgotten as a real man? I am but a legend?
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm
afraid it is.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hmm.
Good. History is a burden. Stories can make us fly.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm
still having a little trouble believing yours, I'm afraid.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is it so
hard to credit? That a man born into wealth and privilege
should find the plight of the oppressed and weak too much to bear...
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No. <br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until
one night he is moved to steal a Tardis? Fly among the stars,
fighting the good fight. Clara told me your stories.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She
should not have told you any of that.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well.
Well, once the story started, she could hardly stop herself.
You are her hero, I think.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm not
a hero.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well,
neither am I. But if we both keep pretending to be. Ha-ha! Perhaps
others will be heroes in our name. Perhaps we will both be
stories. And may those stories never end. <br>
(They shake hands.) <br>
ROBIN: Goodbye, Doctor, Time Lord of
Gallifrey.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goodbye,
Robin Hood, Earl of Loxley.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBIN: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And
remember, Doctor.
I'm just as real as you are.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]<br>
<br>
</b>CLARA: Admit it. You like him.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm leaving him a present, aren't I?
<br>
<br>
<b>[By a stream]</b><br>
<br>
((Robin looks at a woman's portrait
in a locket around his neck, as the Tardis dematerialises to reveal
that same young woman has been standing behind it.)<br>
QUAYLES WARD: Robin? I've found you at last.
<br>
ROBIN: Marian?&nbsp; Thank you. Thank you, Doctor! <br>
(He fires an arrow in the air, it comes to rest I know not where.)<br>
ROBIN: Ha-ha-ha!
