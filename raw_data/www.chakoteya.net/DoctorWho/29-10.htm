the big house. She breaks in through a boarded up window and takes
photographs of the plastic covered chandeliers resting on the floors,
and other pieces of furniture. Then she notices the letter B peeking
from underneath a piece of peeling wallpaper. She pulls at it to reveal
the words Beware the weeping angel. Underneath that is Oh, and duck!
Really, duck! Sally Sparrow duck, now.
So she ducks just before the window behind her is broken by a thrown

her torch reveals a statue outside, a winged angel with its hands

KATHY [OC]: My dearest Sally Sparrow. If my grandson has done as he
promises he will, then as you read these words it has been mere minutes
since we last spoke. For you. For me, it has been over sixty years. The
third of the photographs is of my children. The youngest is Sally. I
named her after you, of course. <br>

behind her reveals its eyes. Sally takes the key and turns. It hides
its eyes again. Sally hears the sound of the front door closes and runs
downstairs, just before the statue that had the key can touch her.) <br>

a good and full life. I've loved a good man and been well loved in

they call them Easter eggs. You have to go looking for them. Follow a
bunch of clues on the menu screen. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Complicated. <br>
LARRY: Sorry. It's interesting, actually. He is on seventeen different
DVDs. There are seventeen totally unrelated DVDs, all with him on.
Always hidden away, always a secret. Not even the publishers know how
he got there. I've talked to the manufacturers, right? They don't even
know. He's like he's a ghost DVD extra. Just shows up where he's not
supposed to be. But only on those. Those seventeen. <br>
SALLY: Well, what does he do? <br>
LARRY: Just sits there, making random remarks. It's like we're hearing
half a conversation. Me and the guys are always trying to work out the

DOCTOR: Very complicated. <br>
BANTO [OC]: Laurence? Need you. <br>
LARRY: Excuse me a sec. <br>

DOCTOR [on screen]: People assume that time is a strict progression of
cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective
viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey
stuff. <br>

the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you

tonight, but apparently it would've torn a hole in the fabric of space
and time, and destroyed two thirds of the universe. Also, I'd lost my
hair. <br>
SALLY: Two thirds of the universe. Where'd you get that from? <br>
BILLY: There's a man in 1969. He sent me with a message for you. <br>
SALLY: What man? <br>
BILLY: The Doctor. <br>
SALLY: And what was the message? <br>
BILLY: Just this. Look at the list. <br>
SALLY: What does that mean? Is that it? Look at the list? <br>
BILLY: He said you'd have it by now. A list of seventeen DVDs. I didn't
stay a policeman back then. Got into publishing. Then video publishing.
Then DVDs, of course. <br>
SALLY: You put the Easter Egg on. <br>
BILLY: Have you noticed what all seventeen DVDs have in common yet? I
suppose it's hard for you, in a way. <br>
SALLY: How could the Doctor have even known I had a list? I only just
got this. <br>
BILLY: I asked him how, but he said he couldn't tell me. He said you'd
understand it one day, but that I never would. <br>
SALLY: Soon as I understand it, I'll come and tell you. <br>
BILLY: No, gorgeous girl, you can't. There's only tonight. He told me
all those years ago that we'll only meet again this one time. On the
night I die. <br>
SALLY: Oh, Billy. <br>
BILLY: It's kept me going. I'm an old, sick man. But I've had something
to look forward to. Ah, life is long, and you are hot. Oh, look at my
hands. They're old man's hands. How did that happen? <br>
SALLY: I'll stay. I'm going to stay with you, okay? <br>
BILLY: Thank you, Sally Sparrow. I have till the rain stops. <br>
(Later, the rain has stopped and the bed is empty. Sally leaves the
hospital.)

picture quality on this one, but I don't know <br>
SALLY: It doesn't matter. <br>
LARRY: Okay. There he is. <br>
SALLY: The Doctor. <br>
LARRY: Who's the Doctor? <br>
SALLY: He's the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Yup. That's me. <br>
SALLY: Okay, that was scary. <br>
LARRY: No, it sounds like he's replying, but he always says that. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Yes, I do. <br>
LARRY: And that. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Yup. And this. <br>
SALLY: He can hear us. Oh, my God, you can really hear us? <br>
LARRY: Of course he can't hear us. Look, I've got a transcript. See?
Everything he says. Yup, that's me. Yes, I do. Yup, and this. Next it's
<br>
DOCTOR [on screen] + LARRY: Are you going to read out the whole thing? <br>
LARRY: Sorry. <br>
SALLY: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm a time traveller. Or I was. I'm stuck in 1969. <br>
MARTHA [on screen]: We're stuck. All of space and time, he promised me.
Now I've got a job in a shop. I've got to support him! <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Martha. <br>
MARTHA [on screen]: Sorry. <br>
SALLY: I've seen this bit before. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Quite possibly. <br>
SALLY: 1969, that's where you're talking from? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Afraid so. <br>
SALLY: But you're replying to me. You can't know exactly what I'm going
to say, forty years before I say it. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Thirty eight. <br>
LARRY: I'm getting this down. I'm writing in your bits. <br>
SALLY: How? How is this possible? Tell me. <br>
LARRY: Not so fast. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: People don't understand time. It's not what you
think it is. <br>
SALLY: Then what is it? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Complicated. <br>
SALLY: Tell me. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Very complicated. <br>
SALLY: I'm clever and I'm listening. And don't patronise me because
people have died, and I'm not happy. Tell me. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: People assume that time is a strict progression of
cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective
viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey
stuff. <br>
SALLY: Yeah, I've seen this bit before. You said that sentence got away
from you. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: It got away from me, yeah. <br>
SALLY: Next thing you're going to say is, well I can hear you. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Well, I can hear you. <br>
SALLY: This isn't possible. <br>
LARRY: No. It's brilliant! <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Well, not hear you, exactly, but I know everything
you're going to say. <br>
LARRY: Always gives me the shivers, that bit. <br>
SALLY: How can you know what I'm going to say? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Look to your left. <br>
(Where Larry is sitting on the floor, writing.) <br>
LARRY: What does he mean by look to your left? I've written tons about
that on the forums. I think it's a political statement. <br>
SALLY: He means you. What are you doing? <br>
LARRY: I'm writing in your bits. That way I've got a complete
transcript of the whole conversation. Wait until this hits the net.
This will explode the egg forums. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: I've got a copy of the finished transcript. It's on
my autocue. <br>
SALLY: How can you have a copy of the finished transcript? It's still
being written. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: I told you. I'm a time traveller. I got it in the
future. <br>
SALLY: Okay, let me get my head round this. You're reading aloud from a
transcript of a conversation you're still having. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Yeah. Wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey. <br>
SALLY: Never mind that. You can do shorthand? <br>
LARRY: So? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: What matters is, we can communicate. We have got
big problems now. They have taken the blue box, haven't they? The
angels have the phone box. <br>
LARRY: The angels have the phone box. That's my favourite, I've got it
on a t-shirt. <br>
SALLY: What do you mean, angels? You mean those statue things? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Creatures from another world. <br>
SALLY: But they're just statues. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Only when you see them. <br>
SALLY: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: The lonely assassins, they used to be called. No
one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the
universe, or very nearly, and they have survived this long because they
have the most perfect defence system ever evolved. They are
quantum-locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The
moment they are seen by any other living creature, they freeze into
rock. No choice. It's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any
living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone.
Of course, a stone can't kill you either. But then you turn your head
away, then you blink, and oh yes it can. <br>
SALLY: Don't take your eyes off that. <br>
(There is an Angel close by.) <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: That's why they cover their eyes. They're not
weeping. They can't risk looking at each other. Their greatest asset is
their greatest curse. They can never be seen. The loneliest creatures
in the universe. And I'm sorry. I am very, very sorry. It's up to you
now. <br>
SALLY: What am I supposed to do? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: The blue box, it's my time machine. There is a
world of time energy in there they could feast on forever, but the
damage they could do could switch off the sun. You have got to send it
back to me. <br>
SALLY: How? How? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: And that's it, I'm afraid. There's no more from you
on the transcript, that's the last I've got. I
don't know what stopped you talking, but I can guess. They're coming.
The angels are coming for you. But listen, your life could depend on
this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They are
fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look
away, and don't blink. Good luck. <br>
(The picture freezes.) <br>
SALLY: No! Don't! You can't! <br>
LARRY: I'll rewind him. <br>
SALLY: What good would that do? You're not looking at the statue. <br>
LARRY: Neither are you. <br>
(The Angel is towering over them, reaching out, mouth wide open. They
back away.) <br>
SALLY: Keep looking at it. Keep looking at it. <br>
LARRY: There's just one, right, there's just this one. We're okay if we
just keep staring at this one statue. Everything's
going to be fine. <br>
SALLY: There are three more. <br>
LARRY: Three? <br>
SALLY: They were upstairs before, but I think I heard them moving. <br>
LARRY: Moving where? Three of them? Moving where? <br>
SALLY: I'm going to look around. I'm going to check. You keep looking
at this one. Don't blink. Remember what he said. Don't even blink. <br>
LARRY: Who blinks? I'm too scared to blink. <br>
SALLY: Okay, we're going to the door. The front door. <br>
(Sally guides Larry backwards to the doorway.) Okay. We can't both get
to the front door without taking our eyes off that thing, so you stay
here. <br>
LARRY: What? <br>
SALLY: I'll be just round the corner. You stay here. They've locked it.
They've locked us in! <br>
LARRY: Why? <br>
SALLY [OC]: I've got something they want. <br>
LARRY: What? <br>
SALLY: The key. I took it last time I was here. They followed me to get
it back. I led them to the blue box. Now they've got that. <br>
LARRY: Well, give them the key. <br>
SALLY: I'm going to check the back door. You wait here. <br>
LARRY: Give them the key! Give them what they want! Sally, no. What if
they come behind me? <br>
SALLY [OC]: Hang on! <br>
LARRY: Oh, God. Oh, God. <br>
SALLY [OC]: It's locked! <br>
(Larry looks behind him briefly to check where the doorway is, and when
he turns back the Angel is inches from his face.) <br>
LARRY: Sally! Sally! <br>
SALLY [OC]: It won't open! <br>
LARRY: Sally, please, I can't do this! Sally, hurry up! Where are you? <br>
(He backs away through the doorway.) <br>
SALLY: Larry? They've blocked off the back door, but there's a cellar.
There might be a way out. A delivery hatch or something. <br>
LARRY: Coming! I can't stay here. <br>
(Larry backs away round the corner.)

Angels.) <br>
SALLY: Okay, boys, I know how this works. You can't move so long as I
can see you. Whole world in the box, the Doctor says. Hope he's not
lying, because I don't see how else we're getting out. <br>
(Larry runs past her. The Angel from upstairs is now behind them.) <br>
SALLY: Oh, and there's your one. <br>
LARRY: Why's it pointing at the light? <br>
(The light bulb flickers as they go to the Tardis, back to back.) <br>
SALLY: Oh, my God, it's turning out the lights. <br>
LARRY: Quickly! <br>
SALLY: I can't find the lock! <br>
LARRY: Sally, hurry up! Get it open! They're getting closer. Sally,

DVD glows.) <br>
DOCTOR [hologram]: Please insert the disc and prepare for departure. <br>
SALLY: Looks like a DVD player. There's a slot. <br>
(The Angels attack the Tardis.) <br>
LARRY: They're trying to get in! <br>
SALLY: Well, hurry up then! <br>
(As the Tardis rocks to and fro, Larry gets the DVD into the slot. The
time rotor starts up.) <br>
LARRY: What's happening? <br>

SALLY: Oh, my God, it's leaving us behind. Doctor, no! You can't! <br>

wide and not covering their eyes.) <br>

them. They're looking at each other. They're never
going to move again.

photographs and letter, and also a picture of an Angel covering its

SALLY: Of course I can't let it go. <br>

How could he get a copy of the transcript? Where did he get all that
information from? <br>

always happen to me in quite the right order. Gets a bit confusing at
times, especially at weddings. I'm rubbish at weddings, especially my

happened to you yet. None of it. It's still in your future. <br>

sure you've got this with you. You're going to need it. <br>
