from La Traviata, but he doesn't know the words - except its
title.)&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Ra, ra, rum, rum, da, ra! Ra, ra, da, dum, da ,dah. La Donna e

(He waves at security as he drives into a Restricted Area. Welcome to
Hoo, on the Isle of Grain. A man with a moustache, dressed in white
overalls is whistling as he pedals his bike. He stops, gets off and
takes a toolbox, then walks down a few steps where he meets a man in a
white lab coat.) <br>
SLOCUM: Hello, John. how's it going on in there? <br>
BROMLEY: Oh, still drilling away like mad. <br>
SLOCUM: Sound's more like a blooming dentist! <br>
BROMLEY: Yes.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Plenty of computer panels and white-coated people
with clip-boards.) <br>
SLOCUM: Excuse me, Sir Keith? <br>
GOLD: Yes? <br>
SLOCUM: You called for someone from maintenance. <br>
GOLD: Ah yes. I'd like you to have a look a number two output pipe. <br>
SLOCUM: Oh, on the blink again, is she? <br>
GOLD: Yes, I've had it take out of service. We've switched over to one
and three. <br>
SLOCUM: Okay, let's take a look at it. <br>
(They walk down a short passageway.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Drill head]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A noisy room with more clip-board carriers and a
circular well in the middle. This has one large pipe in the middle and
several smaller ones attached around the side.) <br>
SLOCUM: I see what you mean. Okay, I'll fix it up. <br>
GOLD: As quickly as possible, please. Professor Stahlman doesn't want
any delays. <br>
SLOCUM: Don't worry about it. It doesn't look too serious. <br>
GOLD: Good. Thank you.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Gold returns. An imperious looking man with a
neat beard enters, with his lady assistant staying one step behind.) <br>
STAHLMAN: Sir Keith? Why has the drilling rate been slowed down? <br>
GOLD: Oh, number two pipe is out of action. Naturally, we had to
decelerate. <br>
STAHLMAN: Oh, I do understand the technical problems. <br>
GOLD: I didn't mean to imply otherwise. <br>
STAHLMAN: What I don't understand is why you took it upon yourself to
interfere. <br>
GOLD: Well, I saw the malfunction report on number two pipe several
days ago. I saw no report of its repair. I assumed you must have
overlooked it. <br>
STAHLMAN: I overlook nothing, Sir Keith. The malfunction on number two
pipe's not sufficient to warrant a stoppage in the drilling and you
have no authority to order one. <br>
GOLD: Professor Stahlman, as Executive Director of this project, my
concern <br>
STAHLMAN: Your concern is with such important matters as the canteen
facilities and the new roster for the cleaners. Anything to do with the
drilling is my concern and mine alone. And that includes minor
maintenance problems. <br>
GOLD: Surely in a situation like this, there's no such thing as a minor
problem? <br>
STAHLMAN: Sir Keith, I'll make a bargain with you. You stay away from
my drilling and I'll let you run your canteen. <br>
(Stahlman leaves, but his assistant, Petra Williams, remains. At the
drill head, Slocum loosens some bolts attaching the drill with a
wrench. He sits back on his heels when green ooze comes out. He touches
it and pulls his hand away in pain. His skin has turned green.) <br>
GOLD: Bit why is he so unreasonable? You'd think I'm some sort of a
rival. <br>
PETRA: He's been working on this project all his life. Naturally, he
feels possessive about it. <br>
GOLD: Well, I've got another piece of news he won't altogether care
for. <br>
PETRA: What's that? <br>
GOLD: I've sent for a drilling consultant. A chap called Greg Sutton.
One of the most experienced oil men in the world. <br>
PETRA: But this isn't an oil rig. We use a totally different method of
drilling. <br>
GOLD: Yes, yes, I know, but I'd feel happier if someone on this project
knew a little more about the purely practical aspects of drilling and
its dangers. <br>
PETRA: When does he arrive? <br>
GOLD: Oh, any time now. He's flying in from Kuwait. <br>
(Slocum enters, slowly.) <br>
STAHLMAN: Oh, have you finished? <br>
SLOCUM: Yes. <br>
(Slocum leaves.) <br>
STAHLMAN: Good. Put number two pipe back into service and accelerate
drilling speed three and a half percent. <br>
MAN: Yes. <br>
STAHLMAN: Perhaps we can now make up for lost time. <br>
(Slocum leaves the underground complex and staggers past where he left
his bike towards the rail tracks. He leans against a metal ladder. A
man in a brick building spots him and runs over to help. Slocum attacks
him viciously.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sergeant Benton hammers a nail into a wall and
hangs a group picture on it. The Brigadier enters from the Control room
through a nine inch thick door.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Morning, Benton. <br>
BENTON: Morning, sir. It's the best they could do us on such short
notice. <br>
BRIGADIER: It'll do. Have you contacted the Doctor? <br>
BENTON: He's on his way over, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Anything on Slocum? <br>
BENTON: No, sir. The lads are still looking. <br>
BRIGADIER: Still? <br>
BENTON: It's a rambling place this, sir. Slocum knows it a lot better
than we do. If we had more men, we could <br>
BRIGADIER: No, we don't want a panic. <br>
(The Doctor enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Brigadier. Making yourself at home? <br>
BRIGADIER: How are you, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Fine, thank you, fine. <br>
(The Doctor picks up a framed photograph from the pile on the
Brigadier's desk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good heavens. Which one's you? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, don't you recognise one? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, don't tell me. let me guess. <br>
(The officers in the picture are all wearing shorts, so it was taken
somewhere tropical.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not that one. Not that one. What, none of them? <br>
BRIGADIER: Fifth from the left, third row. <br>
DOCTOR: (laughing) Yes, well, if it's true, I can see why you grew that
moustache. <br>
BRIGADIER: Trouble seems to follow you, doesn't it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
BRIGADIER: You persuade me to allow you and Miss Shaw to attend this
project as observers <br>
DOCTOR: Allow? Look, Miss Shaw may have the misfortune to work for you,
Brigadier. I am a free agent. <br>
BRIGADIER: And within a few hours of your arrival, I have a motiveless
murder on my hands. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
BRIGADIER: Late yesterday afternoon, one of the technicians was beaten
to death with this. <br>
(Slocum's wrench.) <br>
DOCTOR: And do you know who did the killing? <br>
BRIGADIER: The wrench was found near the body. It belongs to a
drill-head rigger called Harry Slocum. We're still looking for him. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know anything about him? <br>
BENTON: Seems to have been one of the most popular men on the complex,
sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Something else, Doctor. Try touching the wrench. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's still warm. <br>
BRIGADIER: When it was first found, it was red hot, as though it had
been in a furnace. Any theories? <br>
DOCTOR: If the wrench had been subjected to intense energy, it might
have disturbed its atomic make-up. <br>
BRIGADIER: Chase up those patrols, will you, Benton? I want that man
Slocum found. <br>
BENTON: Right away, sir. <br>
(Benton leaves.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, why were you so keen to observe this project? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a matter of great scientific interest, my dear
fellow. First penetration of the Earth's crust. Well, naturally I'm
interested. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'd concentrate on finding that rigger if I was you.
Well, excuse me, I must get back to work. <br>
BRIGADIER: You're taking part in the project? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, in a way. Some related experiments, you know.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SUTTON: Getting a respectable tan, bingo! I get
snatched off a drill rig in Kuwait just when I'm sure we've made a
strike, flown back so fast my stomach's still over the Med and I still
haven't the faintest idea what I'm supposed to be doing here. <br>
GOLD: Well, I asked for a top oil rig man, Mister Sutton, and you're
the one they sent me. <br>
SUTTON: Well, that's very flattering. Now look, this is a government
project, right? <br>
GOLD: Right. <br>
SUTTON: So now I'm a sort of temporary civil servant? <br>
GOLD: Broadly speaking, yes. How do you like the idea? <br>
SUTTON: No comment. What's this supposed to be? <br>
GOLD: That, Mister Sutton, is the drill head. <br>
SUTTON: That is a drill head? You've got to be joking! <br>
GOLD: No, that's a drill head, I assure you. The only one of its kind
in the world. <br>
SUTTON: Well, how deep are you? <br>
GOLD: Twenty miles. <br>
SUTTON: Twenty miles? Oh, come on now. You'd get such a whip in the
drill pipes, they'd fracture. <br>
GOLD: No pipes, Mister Sutton. A robot drill with its built-in power
source, fed by cables from our own nuclear reactor. <br>
SUTTON: Twenty miles. Well, you're liable to wake up Old Nick going
that deep. <br>
GOLD: Yes! As a matter of fact, some of the technicians have nicknamed
this place the Inferno. Come around here. There's the monitoring system
over there, you see? Then over here we have the alarm circuitry. <br>
SUTTON: What's it all in aid of? <br>
GOLD: Well, soon we shall penetrate the Earth's crust and then we'll be
able to tap the pockets of Stahlman's gas that lie beneath it. <br>
SUTTON: Pockets of what? <br>
GOLD: Stahlman's gas. So named in honour of the originator of the
project. <br>
SUTTON: You mean like North Sea gas? <br>
GOLD: No, no, no, no. An infinitely more powerful energy source. <br>
SUTTON: What do you do with it once you've got it? <br>
GOLD: Well, according to Professor Stahlman, we shall have, quote, a
vast new storehouse of energy which has lain dormant since the
beginning of time, unquote. <br>
SUTTON: You learn something new every day. Now what did you say these
pipes do? <br>
GOLD: They siphon the coolant chemical down to the bore. <br>
SUTTON: Okay, Sir Keith. Well, I get the picture, but I still don't see
where I fit in. <br>
GOLD: Well, I want someone on this project who's got a good practical
knowledge of drilling, and of coping with any emergencies that may
arise. <br>
SUTTON: Are you having trouble here then? <br>
GOLD: Not yet. <br>
SUTTON: But you may have? <br>
GOLD: Well, it's my job to cover any eventuality, Mister Sutton. Now
it's time I introduced you to some of the senior staff.

SUTTON: Hi. <br>
PETRA: How do you do? <br>
SUTTON: All the better for seeing you, Petra. Perhaps you could help me
settle in the place? <br>
PETRA: How do you mean, Mister Sutton? <br>
SUTTON: Well, you know, show me round, dash off a few letters. Perhaps
I could borrow you for a bit. <br>
PETRA: Mister Sutton, I am Professor Stahlman's personal assistant, not
a typist, and I'm not available for borrowing. Will you excuse me? <br>

GOLD: Come and meet the boss. <br>
STAHLMAN: Just take them (unintelligible) <br>
WOMAN: Yes, sir. <br>
GOLD: May I present Professor Eric Stahlman, the instigator of the
entire project. <br>
STAHLMAN: The instigator? You make it sound as if I'd perpetrated some
crime against humanity. <br>
GOLD: Hardly that, Professor. This is Mister Sutton. <br>
STAHLMAN: So I gather. Another recruit to your cause, no doubt. <br>
SUTTON: What cause? <br>
STAHLMAN: Well, his crusade to bring this whole operation to a grinding
halt, Mister Sutton. <br>
GOLD: Professor, please. <br>
STAHLMAN: Well, he's a dedicated man, you see, dedicated to stifling us
with over-caution and an over-abundance of experts and advisors. We're
drowning in them, Mister Sutton. <br>
SUTTON: I didn't volunteer for this job, you know. <br>
STAHLMAN: How you came here is of no importance to me. You're here. We
see them everywhere. Advisors on this, advisors on that. <br>

STAHLMAN: Look, there's another one. <br>
DOCTOR: Our liver playing us up again this morning, is it Professor? <br>
SUTTON: You have problems, Sir Keith. <br>
GOLD: Yes. <br>
SUTTON: Who's the gentleman in the fancy dress? <br>
GOLD: Ah, that's the Doctor. A brilliant mind. We're very lucky to have
him as advisor. Come, I'll introduce you. Doctor, may I introduce
Mister Sutton. <br>
SUTTON: Hello, Doc. <br>
DOCTOR: Welcome to the Inferno, Mister Sutton. <br>
SUTTON: And what do you think of this project, Doc? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think that certain people ought to pay a lot more
attention to the warnings of this computer. <br>
SUTTON: Like him, you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Mind you, I'm not wild about computers myself, but they
are a tool. If you have a tool, it's stupid not to use it. <br>
(The Doctor goes to a side panel and flips a switch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Power for my own little project. Nice to have met you, Mister
Sutton. <br>
(The Doctor starts to leave.) <br>
STAHLMAN: All those so-called experts. It's a waste of valuable time
and money. <br>
(The Doctor goes to a technician making notes at a computer terminal.) <br>
DOCTOR: Give that more lateral compensation, old chap, or you'll blow
the main condenser banks. Cost thousands to put that right. Waste of
valuable time and money. Hmm? (The Doctor leaves and Stahlman goes over
to the terminal to check.) <br>
STAHLMAN: I'm rapidly losing patience with that man.

LATIMER: No, we're still searching for him. <br>
DOCTOR: Nasty business that. <br>
LATIMER: Yes. Still, you should be safe in there. I'm sure this Harry
Slocum character won't have one of your funny gadgets. <br>

DOCTOR: Good. <br>
LIZ: Oh, did you get those figures from the computer? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but I think you'll find they only confirm what we already
know. <br>
LIZ: Well, I'll check them again anyway. How are things at Central
Control? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the usual friction between Sir Keith and Stahlman. <br>
LIZ: Oh, did you see the Brigadier? <br>
DOCTOR: There's been a murder, Liz. <br>
LIZ: I know. One of the sentries was in earlier making a spot check. He
told me about it. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a dreadful business, a murder without a motive. Right,
let's get back to work, shall we? <br>
LIZ: Doctor, you're not still thinking of making a run with the Tardis
console, are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed I am. That's why we came here. <br>
LIZ: Now be sensible. It's too dangerous. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, Liz. Look, without the Tardis I feel rather lost. A
stranger in a foreign land. A shipwrecked mariner. <br>
LIZ: When do you want to make this trial run? <br>
DOCTOR: In a minute. <br>
LIZ: Hey, you're not serious? Why the sudden rush? <br>
DOCTOR: Right, we've been over this many times. You know exactly what
to do, don't you? <br>

DOCTOR: Well then, take up your position and I'll switch the nuclear
power through. <br>

Yeah. Look, I've done a complete routine check. <br>

LIZ: I can't cut back! The circuits are locked and overloading! <br>
(The Tardis console and the Doctor dematerialise. They fly through a
distorting nothingness and get separated. Finally Liz pulls down one of
the power breakers and the voltage drops back to 7M. The Doctor
continues to be pulled at by strange forces. Liz uses a piece of wood
on the other handle to get more leverage, and the voltage drops to nil.

convenient pile of hay. Finally he stops by a row of timbered

STEWART: This is only the beginning. <br>
SHAW: We have other methods. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you have. But it won't do you any good. <br>
STEWART: You'll talk, eventually. <br>
SHAW: Everybody talks. <br>
DOCTOR: How can I give you information that doesn't exist? <br>
STEWART: The information must exist and you will give it to us! <br>
SHAW: Name? <br>
STEWART: Who sent you here?! <br>
SHAW: Which of our enemies are you working for? <br>
STEWART: Who are your associates? <br>
DOCTOR: I came here on my own. I came by accident. I came here. The
Tardis console slipped me sideways in time. Slipped me sideways in
time. <br>
SHAW: Shall we proceed to stage two interrogation? He's just babbling. <br>
STEWART: No, he's a tough one. He might die before he talked. <br>
SHAW: Yes. We'd better let him get his strength back. <br>
(The sound of the drill rises.) <br>
DOCTOR: That Stahlman. He's accelerating the drilling. <br>
STEWART: All right, we'll start again, shall we? <br>
SHAW: Who sent you here? <br>
STEWART: Why did you come? <br>
(Stahlman enters and turns on the main light.) <br>
STAHLMAN 2: Well, what progress have you made? <br>
STEWART: As you can see, Director, the prisoner is still being
interrogated. Proceeding according to plan! <br>
DOCTOR: I see you're wearing white cotton gloves, Director. May we ask
why? <br>
STAHLMAN 2: You're allowing the prisoner to be impertinent? <br>
DOCTOR: Brigade Leader, ask him to take off his left glove. I think
you'll find it very interesting. <br>
STEWART: Director? <br>
STAHLMAN 2: Well, they say a madman should be humoured. <br>
(Stahlman has bandages under the glove.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why the bandages, professor? <br>
STAHLMAN 2: I scorched my hands. <br>
DOCTOR: You touched some of that green substance, from that cracked
jar, didn't you? Just a little, but it's enough to infect you. <br>
STEWART: Benton! Take him away, down to the security cells. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me. You're seriously ill. You've been infected. <br>
STAHLMAN 2: Take him away. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me, Stahlman, for God's sake. <br>
(Benton hauls the Doctor out.) <br>
STEWART: You will supervise the transfer of the prisoner to the
security cells. <br>
SHAW: Very well, Leader. <br>
STEWART: At once, if you please! <br>
SHAW: Yes, Leader! <br>
(Shaw leaves.) <br>
STEWART: You're taking a great deal of interest in this prisoner,
Director? <br>
STAHLMAN 2: For security <br>
STEWART: Security? Is my responsibility. <br>
STAHLMAN 2: Since you allowed the man to enter the complex and roam
about at will <br>
STEWART: The man was caught! He is no longer a danger to us. The people
who sent him, how and why he came here, this information is vital. <br>
STAHLMAN 2: Then you'd better get him to talk, and do it quick. Before
the day is over, I want him liquidated.

that you're from one of these crackpot free speech groups, trying to
make some crazy demonstration.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no! <br>
SHAW: Look, if you'll give me a full confession, I may be able to
convince them that you're some harmless lunatic. You'll get away with a

drag him away. The Doctor rushes over to grapple with Stahlman, and

DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
GREG: Surely there must be some way of sealing the shaft? Why don't the
government evacuate us all and blow up the whole area? <br>
DOCTOR: Too late, Mister Sutton. You've unleashed the energies of the
Earth's core. <br>
GREG: All right, but we must cap the bore somehow. <br>
DOCTOR: No substance on this Earth is strong enough to withstand those
pressures. <br>
GREG: Okay, so what's going to happen? <br>

DOCTOR: Well, the heat and the pressures'll continue to build up until
the Earth dissolves in a fury of expanding gasses, just as it was
billions of years ago. <br>

Leader, who draws his pistol.) <br>

more interested in getting to the drill head than he is in us. <br>

across the floor of the control room. But before Bromley can get to the

DOCTOR: Yes, of course, of course. An infinity of universes, ergo an
infinite number of choices. So free will is not an illusion after all.
The pattern can be changed. <br>
BRIGADIER: (into phone) Hello, get me the medical section will you?
Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Now look. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, very well. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, wait a minute. I'm not sick, I'm not in need of a doctor
and I'm not a raving idiot! <br>
(The Doctor slams the phone down.) <br>
BRIGADIER: No, no, no, of course not. Perhaps you've had some sort of
nightmare. <br>
LIZ: He did disappear. We saw him. <br>
DOCTOR: Sir Keith, unless we do something very, very quickly indeed,
there's going to be a disaster. <br>
GOLD: How do you know, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I've already seen it.

An accident? <br>
GOLD: This is a direct consequence of your orders to my chauffeur. <br>
STAHLMAN: Hmm? Huh! Ridiculous. <br>
GOLD: Professor, the Minister would like you to report to him
immediately, please. <br>
STAHLMAN: Oh, he would, would he? <br>
GOLD: There's to be an inquiry into this project and, if I may say so,
into your conduct. <br>
STAHLMAN: You can make as many inquiries as you like, my dear Gold,
after we've penetrated the Earth's crust.

all the trouble it's caused us? <br>

disappear, this whole business might have been cleared up a great deal
sooner. <br>

DOCTOR: And a fat lot of notice you all took. <br>

other self. I shall leave at once. <br>

fully operational. <br>

DOCTOR: Goodbye, Liz. I shall miss you, my dear. But I've had about all
I can stand of this pompous, self-opinionated idiot here. <br>
(The Doctor and the console vanish.) <br>
LIZ: Now see what you've done. <br>

LIZ: Well, I shall be most interested to see how you get on without
him, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: May I remind you, Miss Shaw, that you're still a serving
member of UNIT? I don't entirely care for your tone. <br>
LIZ: I don't much care for yours either. No wonder the Doctor cleared
off. <br>

Doctor's jacket.) <br>

LIZ: Where did you go? <br>
DOCTOR: A few seconds forward in time, and a few hundred yards due east
in space. <br>
LIZ: The rubbish tip? <br>
DOCTOR: The rubbish tip. <br>
LIZ: Oh, dear. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, Brigadier, my dear fellow, I wonder whether I could borrow
a couple of your stalwart chaps to give me a hand in bringing the
Tardis back? It's landed in rather an inaccessible position. <br>
BRIGADIER: Pompous, self-opinionated idiot, I believe you said, Doctor?
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well we don't want to bear a grudge for a few hasty words,
do we? No, not after all the years that we've worked together. Now come
long, my dear fellow, put on a smile. Just remember all <br>
