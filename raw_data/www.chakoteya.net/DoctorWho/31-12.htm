unappreciated artist is having a breakdown by his new painting of Still
Life with Twelve Sunflowers, dedicated to Amy. His doctor is in
attendance.) <br>
GACHET: Vincent, can you hear me? Please. <br>
VERNET: It's not enough he goes drinking all round the town. Now the
whole neighbourhood has to listen to his screaming. <br>
GACHET: He's very ill, Madame Vernet. <br>
(Madame Vernet looks at another painting, which we do not get to see.) <br>
VERNET: Look at this, even worse than his usual rubbish. What's it
supposed to be?

Minister.) <br>
BRACEWELL: It was found behind the wall, in an attic in France. It's
genuine. It's a Van Gogh. <br>
CHURCHILL: Why bring it to me? <br>
BRACEWELL: Because it's obviously a message, and you can see who it's
for. <br>
CHURCHILL: Can't say I understand it. <br>
BRACEWELL: You're not supposed to understand it, Prime Minister. You're
supposed to deliver it.

GUARD: Cell four two six. The Doctor? Do you mean Doctor Song? <br>

RIVER: You're new here, aren't you? <br>
GUARD: First day. <br>
RIVER: Then I'm very sorry. <br>
(River pulls him to the bars and kisses him. Later, a group of armed
guards run to the cell. The guard is inside, pointing his gun at
something.) <br>
GUARD 2: Stay exactly where you are. <br>
GUARD: She had the lipstick. The hallucinogenic lipstick. She tried to
use it on me. Your tricks don't work in here, Doctor Song. <br>

'Bye!' in a bubble.)

is halfway up a staircase when the lights come on.) <br>
LIZ: This is the Royal Collection, and I'm the bloody Queen. What are
you doing here? <br>
RIVER: It's about the Doctor, Ma'am. You met him once, didn't you? I
know he came here. <br>
LIZ: The Doctor? <br>
RIVER: He's in trouble. I need to find him. <br>
LIZ: Then why are you stealing a painting? <br>
RIVER: Look at it. I need to find the Doctor, and I need to show him
this.

man.) <br>
DORIUM: Well now, word on the Belt is you're looking for time travel. <br>
RIVER: Are you selling? <br>
(Dorium snaps his fingers and an alien brings a box.) <br>
DORIUM: A vortex manipulator, fresh off the wrist of a handsome Time
Agent. <br>
(He opens the box and sighs.) <br>
DORIUM: I said off the wrist. <br>
(The alien takes the box away.) <br>
DORIUM: Not cheap, Doctor Song. Have you brought me a pretty toy? <br>
(She takes off one of her earrings.) <br>
RIVER: This is a Calisto Pulse. It can disarm micro-explosives from up
to twenty feet. <br>
DORIUM: What kind of micro-explosives? <br>
RIVER: The kind I just put in your wine.

in the Doctor's jacket pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Vavoom! <br>
AMY: Va-what? <br>
DOCTOR: I can't believe I've never thought of this before. It's genius.
Right. Landed. Come on. <br>
AMY: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR; Planet One. The oldest planet in the universe. And there's a
cliff of pure diamond, and according to legend, on the cliff there's
writing. Letters fifty feet high. A message from the dawn of time And
no one knows what it says, because no one's ever translated it. <br>
DOCTOR: Till today. <br>
AMY: What happens today? <br>
DOCTOR: Us. The Tardis can translate anything. All we have to do is
open the doors and read the very first words in recorded history. <br>
(So they go outside and read - Hello Sweetie &#920;&#931; &#934;&#915;&#933;&#916;&#950;

a hill.) <br>
AMY: Right place? <br>
DOCTOR: Just followed the co-ordinates on the cliff face. Earth.
Britain. one oh two am. No, pm. No, AD. <br>
(They are looking down on a Roman camp.) <br>
AMY: That's a Roman Legion. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, yeah. The Romans invaded Britain several times during
this period. <br>
AMY: Oh, I know. My favourite topic at school. Invasion of the hot
Italians. Yeah, I did get marked down for the title. <br>
(A soldier runs up and salutes.) <br>
CLAUDIO: Hail, Caesar! <br>
DOCTOR: Hi. <br>
CLAUDIO: Welcome to Britain. We are honoured by your presence. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you're only human. Arise, Roman person. <br>
AMY: Why does he think you're Caesar? <br>
(Claudio has a smear of lipstick on his face.) <br>
CLAUDIO: Cleopatra will see you now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIVER: Hello, sweetie. <br>
AMY: River. Hi. <br>
DOCTOR: You graffitied the oldest cliff face in the universe. <br>
RIVER: You wouldn't answer your phone. <br>
(Her slaves leave and she offers the Doctor the rolled up painting.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's this? <br>
RIVER: It's a painting. Your friend Vincent. One of his final works. He
had visions, didn't he? I thought you ought to know about this one. <br>
AMY: Doctor? Doctor, what is this? <br>
(It is a version of Starry Night, with an exploding Tardis in the
middle. After the titles, the three are galloping along on horseback.
Meanwhile -) <br>
AMY: Why is it exploding? <br>
RIVER: I assume it's some kind of warning. <br>
AMY: What, something's going to happen to the Tardis? <br>
RIVER: It might not be that literal. Anyway, this is where he wanted
you. Date and map reference on the door sign, see? <br>
DOCTOR: Does it have a title? <br>
RIVER: The Pandorica Opens. <br>
(Still galloping.) <br>
DOCTOR [on horseback]: Come on. Ya! <br>
AMY: The Pandorica? What is it? <br>
RIVER: A box, a cage, a prison. It was built to contain the most feared
thing in all the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: And it's a fairy tale, a legend. It can't be real. <br>
RIVER: If it is real, it's here and it's opening, and it's got
something to do with your Tardis exploding. Hidden, obviously. Buried
for centuries. You won't find it on a map. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but if you buried the most dangerous thing in the universe,
you'd want to remember where you put it.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The riders arrive and run inside the circle. The
Doctor and River start scanning the stones) <br>
AMY: How come it's not new? <br>
RIVER: Because it's already old. It's been here thousands of years. No
one knows exactly how long. <br>
AMY: Okay, this Pandorica thing. Last time we saw you, you warned us
about it, after we climbed out of the Byzantium. <br>
RIVER: Spoilers. <br>
AMY: No, but you told the Doctor you'd see him again when the Pandorica
opens. <br>
RIVER: Maybe I did, but I haven't yet. But I will have. Doctor, I'm
picking up fry particles everywhere. Energy weapons discharged on this
site. <br>
DOCTOR: If the Pandorica is here, it contains the mightiest warrior in
history. Now, half the galaxy would want a piece of that. Maybe even
fight over it. We need to get down there. <br>
(Night time. River places a device on each corner of the Altar stone.) <br>
RIVER: Right then. Ready. <br>
(There is a sound of machinery moving, then the Altar stone moves aside
to reveal a staircase down into the ground.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Underhenge. <br>
(As they go down, a nearby severed Cyberman head twitches.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor lights a handy torch with his sonic
screwdriver. He lights another for River and they unbar a big door,
then enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's a Pandorica. <br>
(It is a big square monument with a circular design on each face.) <br>
RIVER: More than just a fairy tale. <br>
(The Doctor's foot touches a Cyberman's severed arm lying in the dust
of the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior. A nameless,
terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most
feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it,
or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear
down your world. <br>
AMY: How did it end up in there? <br>
DOCTOR: You know fairy tales. A good wizard tricked it. <br>
RIVER: I hate good wizards in fairy tales. They always turn out to be
him. <br>
AMY: So, it's kind of like Pandora's Box, then? Almost the same name. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, what? <br>
AMY: The story. Pandora's Box, with all the worst things in the world
in it. That was my favourite book when I was a kid. What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Your favourite school topic. Your favourite story. Never ignore
a coincidence, unless you're busy. In which case, always ignore a
coincidence. <br>
RIVER: So can you open it? <br>
DOCTOR: Easily. Anyone can break into a prison. But I'd rather know
what I'm going to find first. <br>
RIVER: You won't have long to wait. It's already opening. There are
layers and layers of security protocols in there, and they're being
disabled one by one. Like it's being unlocked from the inside. <br>
DOCTOR: How long do we have? <br>
RIVER: Hours at the most. <br>
DOCTOR: What kind of security? <br>
RIVER: Everything. Deadlocks, time stops, matter lines. <br>
DOCTOR: What could need all that? <br>
RIVER: What could get past all that? <br>
DOCTOR: Think of the fear that went into making this box. What could
inspire that level of fear? Hello, you. Have we met? <br>
RIVER: So why would it start to open now? <br>
DOCTOR: No idea. <br>
AMY: Ahem, And how could Vincent have known about it? He won't even be
born for centuries. <br>
DOCTOR: The stones. These stones are great big transmitters,
broadcasting a warning to everyone, everywhere, to every time zone. The
Pandorica is opening. <br>
RIVER: Doctor, everyone everywhere? <br>
DOCTOR: Even poor Vincent heard it, in his dreams. But what's in there?
What could justify all this? <br>
RIVER: Doctor, everyone? <br>
DOCTOR: Anything that powerful, I'd know about it. Why don't I know? <br>
RIVER: Doctor, you said everyone could hear it. So who else is coming? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
AMY: Oh? Oh, what? <br>
RIVER: Okay. If it is basically a transmitter, we should be able to
fold back the signal. <br>
DOCTOR: Doing it. <br>
(The Doctor goes around the bases of the Sarsen stones with his sonic
screwdriver.) <br>
AMY: Doing what? <br>
RIVER: Stonehenge is transmitting. It's been transmitting for a while,
so who heard? <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, should be feeding back to you now. River, what's out
there? <br>
RIVER: Give me a moment. <br>
DOCTOR: River, quickly. Anything? <br>
RIVER: Around this planet there are at least ten thousand starships. <br>
AMY: At least? <br>
RIVER: Ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million, I don't know.
There's too many readings. <br>
DOCTOR: What kind of starships? <br>
DALEK [OC]: Maintaining orbit. <br>
DALEK 2 [OC]: I obey. Shield cover compromised on ion sectors. <br>
AMY: Daleks. Those are Daleks. <br>
DALEK [OC]: Scan detects no temporal activity. <br>
DALEK 2 [OC]: Soft grid scan commencing. <br>
DALEK [OC]: Reverse thrust for compensatory stabilisation. <br>
RIVER: Daleks, Doctor. <br>
DALEK [OC]: Launch preliminary armaments protocol. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Dalek fleet, minimum twelve
thousand battleships, armed to the teeth. Ah! But we've got surprise on
our side. They'll never expect three people to attack twelve thousand
Dalek battleships. Because we'd be killed instantly. So it would be a
fairly short surprise. Forget surprise. <br>
CYBERMAN [OC]: Course correction proceeding.) <br>
RIVER: Doctor, Cyberships. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Dalek ships. Listen to them. Those are Dalek ships. <br>
RIVER: Yes. Dalek ships and Cyberships. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we need to start a fight, turn them on each other. I
mean, that's easy. It's the Daleks. They're so cross. <br>
RIVER: Sontaran. Four battlefleets. <br>
DOCTOR: Sontarans! Talk about cross, who stole all their handbags? <br>
RIVER: Terileptil. Slitheen, Chelonian, Nestene, Drahvin. Sycorax,
Haemogoth, Zygon, Atraxi, Draconian. They're all here for the
Pandorica. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you? What could you possibly be?

<br>
AMY: What do we do? <br>
RIVER: Doctor, listen to me. Everything that ever hated you is coming
here tonight. You can't win this. You can't even fight it. Doctor, this
once, just this one time, please, you have to run. <br>
DOCTOR: Run where? <br>
RIVER: Fight how? <br>
DOCTOR: The greatest military machine in the history of the universe. <br>
AMY: What is? The Daleks? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, no. The Romans.

prisoner.) <br>
COMMANDER: So. I return to my command after one week and discover we've
been playing host to Cleopatra. Who's in Egypt. And dead. <br>
RIVER: Yes. Funny how things work out. <br>
(A spaceship buzzes them.) <br>
COMMANDER: The sky is falling and you make jokes. Who are you? <br>
RIVER: When you fight Barbarians, what must they think of you? <br>
COMMANDER: Oh, riddles now. <br>
RIVER: Where do they think you come from? <br>
COMMANDER: A place more deadly and more powerful and more impatient
than their tiny minds can imagine. <br>
(River uses her gun to disintegrate a wooden stand filled with
ornaments.) <br>
RIVER: Where do I come from? Your world has visitors. You're all
Barbarians now. <br>
COMMANDER: What is that? Tell me what? <br>
RIVER: A fool would say the work of the Gods, but you've been a soldier
too long to believe there are Gods watching over us. There is, however,
a man. And tonight he's going to need your help. <br>
MAN [OC]: Sir? <br>
COMMANDER: One moment. <br>
(The Commander has a whispered conference with a shady Centurion.) <br>
COMMANDER: Well, it seems you have a volunteer.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMY: So what's this got to do with the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing, as far as I know. <br>
AMY: But Vincent's painting. The Tardis was exploding. Is that going to
happen? <br>
DOCTOR: One problem at a time. There's forcefield technology inside
this box. If I can enhance the signal, I could extend it all over
Stonehenge. Could buy us half an hour. <br>
AMY: What good is half an hour? <br>
DOCTOR: There are fruit flies live on Hoppledom Six that live for
twenty minutes and they don't even mate for life. There was going to be
a point to that. I'll get back to you. <br>
(Amy takes the ring box from her pocket.) <br>
AMY: So, are you proposing to someone? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry? <br>
AMY: I found this in your pocket. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, no, that's er, a memory. A friend of mine. Someone I
lost. Do you mind? <br>
AMY: It's weird. I feel, I don't know, something. <br>
DOCTOR: People fall out of the world sometimes, but they always leave
traces. Little things we can't quite account for. Faces in photographs,
luggage, half eaten meals, rings. Nothing is ever forgotten, not
completely. And if something can be remembered, it can come back. <br>
AMY: So, was she nice, your friend? <br>
DOCTOR: Remember that night you flew away with me? <br>
AMY: Of course I do. <br>
DOCTOR: And you asked me why I was taking you and I told you there
wasn't a reason. I was lying. <br>
AMY: What, so you did have a reason? <br>
DOCTOR: Your house. <br>
AMY: My house. <br>
DOCTOR: It was too big. Too many empty rooms. Does it ever bother you,
Amy, that your life doesn't make any sense? <br>
(An energy weapon fires at them. It is the severed Cyberman arm. They
hide behind the Pandorica.) <br>
AMY: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, I need a proper look. Got to draw its fire, give it a
target. <br>
AMY: How? <br>
DOCTOR: You know how sometimes I have really brilliant ideas? <br>
AMY: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. <br>
(The Doctor runs out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look at me, I'm a target! <br>
(He gets shot at and hides behind the base of a Sarsen.) <br>
AMY: What is that? <br>
DOCTOR: Cyberarm. Arm of Cyberman. <br>
AMY: And what's a Cyberman? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, sort of part man, part robot. The organic part must have
died out years ago. Now the robot part is looking for, well, fresh
meat. <br>
AMY: What, us? <br>
DOCTOR: It's just like being an organ donor, except you're alive and
sort of screaming. I need to get round behind it. Could you draw its
fire? <br>
AMY: What, like you did? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll be fine if you're quick. It's only got one arm,
literally. <br>
(Amy runs, screaming. The Doctor pounces on the arm.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come here! <br>
(He manages to sonic it.) <br>
AMY: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Scrambled its circuits, but stay where you are, it could be
bluffing. <br>
AMY: Bluffing? It's an arm. <br>
DOCTOR: I said stay where you are! <br>
(Something creeps up behind Amy and lassoes her ankle.) <br>
AMY: Doctor? <br>
(She is pulled to the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Amy! <br>
(The Cyberarm gives the Doctor an electric shock, knocking him out.) <br>
AMY: Doctor! <br>
(Amy is being attacked by the Cyberhead. She grabs it by the ears. It
fizzles, then the mask pops open to reveal a skull, which falls out.
Amy screams. The mask keeps snapping open and shut. She hits it against
a Sarsen until it lets her go, then throws it to the floor. It crawls
away.) <br>
AMY: Doctor? <br>
(The Cyberhead fires a little dart into Amy's neck.) <br>
CYBERHEAD: You will be assimilated. <br>
AMY: Yeah? You and whose body? <br>

goes after the
woozy Amy. She backs out through the big doors.) </font></p>

RORY: She's fine, Doctor. Just unconscious. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Yes, she's sedated, that's all. Half an hour, she'll be
fine. Okay, Romans. Good. I was just wishing for Romans. Good old
River. How many? <br>
RORY: Fifty men up top, volunteers. What about that thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Fifty? You're not exactly a legion. <br>
RORY: Your friend was very persuasive, but it's a tough sell. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know that, Rory. I'm not exactly one to miss the
obvious. But we need everything we can get. Okay, Cyberweapons. This is
basically a sentry box, so headless wonder here was a sentry. Probably
got himself duffed up by the locals. Never underestimate a Celt. <br>
RORY: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hush, Rory. Thinking. Why leave a Cyberman on guard, unless
it's a Cyberthing in the box. But why would they lock up one of their
own? Okay, no, not a Cyberthing, but what? What? No, I'm missing
something obvious, Rory. Something big. Something right slap in front
of me. I can feel it. <br>
RORY: Yeah, I think you probably are. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll get it in a minute. <br>
(The Doctor leaves with the weapons, drops them and returns. He prods
Rory.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello again. <br>
RORY: Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: How've you been? <br>
RORY: Good. Yeah. Good. I mean, Roman. <br>
DOCTOR: Rory, I'm not trying to be rude, but you died. <br>
RORY: Yeah, I know. I was there. <br>
DOCTOR: You died and then you were erased from time. You didn't just
die, you were never born at all. You never existed. <br>
RORY: Erased? What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: How can you be here? <br>
RORY: I don't know. It's kind of fuzzy. <br>
DOCTOR: Fuzzy? <br>

DOCTOR: Because guess who? Ha! Listen, you lot, you're all whizzing
about. It's really very distracting. Could you all just stay still a
minute because I am talking! The question of the hour is, who's got the
Pandorica? Answer, I do. Next question. Who's coming to take it from
me? Come on! Look at me. No plan, no back up, no weapons worth a damn.
Oh, and something else. I don't have anything to lose! So, if you're
sitting up there in your silly little spaceship, with all your silly
little guns, and you've got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight,
just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I
ever stopped you, and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody
else try first. <br>
(The spaceships retreat.) <br>

going to be a huge explosion in the future, on one particular day. And
every other moment in history is cracking around it. <br>

RIVER [memory]: And for those of us who can't read the base code of the

DOCTOR [memory]: Amy's time. <br>
DOCTOR: Doesn't matter. The cracks are everywhere now. Get too close to
them and you can fall right out of the universe. <br>
RORY: So I fell through a crack and now I was never born? <br>
DOCTOR: Basically. <br>
RORY: Well, how did I end up here? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, you shouldn't have. What happened? From your
point of view, what physically happened? <br>
RORY: I was in the cave, with you and Amy. I was dying, and then I was
just here, a Roman soldier. A proper Roman. Head full of Roman stuff. A
whole other life, just here like I'd woken up from a dream. I started
to think it was a dream, you and Amy and Leadworth. And then today, in
the camp, the men were talking about the visitors. The girl with the
red hair. I thought you'd come back for me. But she can't even remember
me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, shut up. <br>
RORY: What? <br>
(The Doctor throws the ring box to Rory.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go get her. <br>
RORY: But I don't understand. Why am I here? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you are. The universe is big. It's vast and complicated
and ridiculous, and sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just
happen and we call them miracles, and that's the theory. Nine hundred
years, never seen one yet, but this would do me. Now get upstairs.
She's Amy and she's surrounded by Romans. I'm not sure history can take
it.
