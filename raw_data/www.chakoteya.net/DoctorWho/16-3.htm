They have collected the shrunken remains of Calufrax and converted it.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Right, let's put these two together and go and find the third.
Er. Oh, I see. <br>
(But he struggles to see how the two irregular polygons fit together.) <br>
ROMANA: Here, let me do it. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROMANA: I used to be rather good at puzzles. <br>
DOCTOR: Puzzles? You don't call that a puzzle, do you? <br>
(Romana succeeds in placing the base and one side.) <br>
ROMANA: Well, hardly complex enough to be called a puzzle, is it. <br>
DOCTOR: It certainly isn't. <br>
ROMANA: Look, shouldn't we be getting on? We've only got two segments.
Why don't you go and find out where our next destination is? <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
(The Doctor takes the tracer and goes towards the console room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ahem. Romana, I've just decided to go and find out where our
next destination is. <br>
ROMANA: Oh. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Have I got a treat in store for you, Romana. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: Really? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: Better than Calufrax, I hope. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, much better than Calufrax. You'll love it, I promise you.
You'll love it. </font></p>

Oxfordshire as a group of robed figures with flaming torches enter.) <br>
DRUIDS: Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach. <br>
(A woman hands a goblet and bowl to the priest and kneels before the
altar stone in the centre.) <br>
DRUIDS: Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach! <br>
(The priest goes to one of the stone and pours the red contents of the
goblet into a hollow at the side of it. The stone glows and starts
pulsing to a heart beat. He adds the contents of the bowl and the beat
gets louder. Everyone backs away except the woman, who kneels with
raised arms.) <br>

ROMANA [OC]: Not yet! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, sorry. Not yet. Not yet? What does she mean, not yet? What
do you mean, not yet? <br>
ROMANA [OC]: I'm not ready yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, sorry. <br>
(Romana enters, wearing a peach trouser suit fastened with a leather
belt, and what my dad calls a skimmer - a flat cap.) <br>
ROMANA: Well, how do I look? <br>
DOCTOR: (without looking) Ravishing. <br>
ROMANA: That's not what I meant. I mean, will this do? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, very nicely, I should think, except for those shoes. <br>
(Four inch heels and just a couple of straps to hold the sole to her
feet.) <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I rather like them. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you please yourself. I'm no fashion expert. <br>
ROMANA: No. <br>
(She leaves to change. There is a strange sound.) <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Beware the Black Guardian. <br>
ROMANA: What about these, Doctor? <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Beware the Black Guardian. <br>
ROMANA: What? Doctor, what does it mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a warning, and a reminder. <br>
(Romana hangs the purple platform shoes on the hatstand and follows the
Doctor into -) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis side room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROMANA: Doctor, I do wish I knew what you were
talking about. <br>
DOCTOR: If she'd been meant to know, he would have told her. <br>
ROMANA: What? Look, I only want to know about our mission. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROMANA: After all, what would I do if something happened to you? <br>
DOCTOR: If something happened to me? Yes, I suppose you have a point.
Yes, I don't really think it's fair. <br>
ROMANA: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Romana, you were not sent on this mission by the President of
the Supreme Council. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, you weren't. <br>
ROMANA: But, I saw. He told me. Well, what am I doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: The voice you just heard and the being you saw in the shape of
the President was the White Guardian, or to be more accurate, the
Guardian of Light and Time as opposed to the Guardian of Darkness,
sometimes called the Black Guardian. They can assume any shape or form
they wish. <br>
ROMANA: Just like the segment of the key. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. That's why our mission is so vital. Romana, the Key of
Time is so powerful that it must not be allowed to fall into the hands
of any one being. It's been broken up into six segments and the
segments scattered through the universe and disguised as other objects.
<br>
ROMANA: Yes, I know that, but what I don't know is why. <br>
DOCTOR: Because there are times when the forces within the universe
upset the cosmic balance so badly that the entire universe is in danger
of eternal chaos. <br>
ROMANA: And I suppose the Key can prevent that. <br>
DOCTOR: That's what the White Guardian said. When it's fully assembled
and activated, it stops everything. <br>
ROMANA: Everything? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. So that the White Guardian can restore the balance. <br>
ROMANA: I see. And I suppose there's a time like that approaching. <br>
DOCTOR: Rapidly. <br>

DOCTOR: Hello, K9. <br>
K9: Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, my dear old thing. My <br>

ROMANA: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: That's your surprise. We've landed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROMANA: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Come here. (whispers) Earth. <br>
ROMANA: Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: I thought you'd be pleased. <br>
ROMANA: I might have guessed. Your favourite planet. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you know that? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, everybody knows that. <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't tell everybody that. <br>
ROMANA: I can't think why, for the life of me. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll like it. It's pretty civilised, on the whole. <br>
ROMANA: Hmm, oxygen level good. Slight aqueous precipitation. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mean it's raining? <br>
ROMANA: So it would appear. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah well, that's what the locals call a soft day. <br>
(Romana tucks the tracer into the back of her belt, and the Doctor
picks up a large multicoloured umbrella.) <br>
ROMANA: Oh, really? <br>
DOCTOR: Any one for tennis? <br>
ROMANA: Tennis? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's an English expression. It means, is anyone coming
outdoors to get soaked? <br>
ROMANA: Oh. <br>
K9: Master? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Guard duty for you, K9. We don't know if the natives are
friendly yet. <br>
K9: Master. <br>
ROMANA: K9, what is tennis? <br>
K9: Real, lawn or table, mistress? <br>
ROMANA: Never mind. Forget it. <br>
K9: Forget. Erase memory banks concerning tennis. Memory erased. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis has parked herself by a cart track
running through a grassy landscape littered with the raised lumps and
bumps of ancient archaeology. Romana starts using the tracer. It isn't
raining.) <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I do believe it's going to be a nice day after all. <br>
ROMANA: So, this is Earth, is it? <br>
(He throws the umbrella away, litterbug.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Pretty, isn't it? <br>
ROMANA: Hmm. Well, the third segments can't be far away. It's over
there. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go. <br>
(Further on, there are fresh holes in the turf where something has been
dug out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Very strange. <br>
ROMANA: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: These are. <br>
ROMANA: Why strange? They're indentations, obviously caused by
something very heavy. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, probably some form of animal. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? They don't have very heavy elephants around here. It must
weigh at least three and a half tons. <br>
ROMANA: Oh more, I should think. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you? <br>
ROMANA: Yes, judging by the specific density of the ground here. <br>
(Her stilettos barely make a dent.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. You know, I <br>
ROMANA: Over there. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that looks promising. <br>
(It's the Stones on the skyline.) <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go and have a look. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Stone circle]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Well, here we are. Yes. What do you think?
Fascinating, eh? <br>
ROMANA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a stone circle. <br>
ROMANA: I can see that, but what's it for? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a sort of megalithic temple cum observatory. <br>
ROMANA: Observatory? They're just stones, aren't they? <br>
(Romana sits to rub her feet. Those shoes are very unsuitable for the
terrain.) <br>
DOCTOR: Just stones? Yes, they're just stones. They're all aligned with
various points on the horizon, giving you sunrise and moonrise at
different times of the year. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I didn't realise the people here were so primitive. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Primitive? No, not now. Thousands of years ago, when
these were built. <br>
ROMANA: Ah, I see. It's very old, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Very. And clever. With some of these circles you could even
calculate eclipses. <br>
ROMANA: Fascinating. Do you think one of these stones is the third
segment? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Try. <br>
(A silver haired woman leans against a stone to watch.) <br>
ROMANA: Oh, that's very odd. Nothing. (gasp) <br>
EMILIA: It's been surveyed, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? <br>
EMILIA: Surveyed. The circle. Many times. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
EMILIA: Ah, so you noticed it, did you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well <br>
EMILIA: I always knew it was a matter of time before another
professional came in and noticed the discrepancies. Oh, haven't I met
you somewhere before, Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor. <br>
EMILIA: Oh, Doctor. Yes, of course. I have a wonderful memory for
faces. Fougous. <br>
DOCTOR: Fougous? <br>
EMILIA: Fougous. Cornish fougous. You read that paper on them at the
symposium at Princeton, or was it Cardiff? Oh, or was it that fool
Leamington-Smith. Oh, dreadful paper. Complete bosh. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? <br>
EMILIA: Professor Emilia Rumford. Author of Bronze Age Burials in
Gloucestershire. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! The definitive work on the subject. <br>
EMILIA: Oh, you're too kind, Doctor, but of course perfectly right. It
was the survey of Doctor Borlase in 1754 that brought you on to it.
That's how I twigged, cos when I came to compare the survey of Doctor
Borlase with the survey of the Reverend Thomas Bright in 1820 and then
the two surveys of 1874 and 1911, well, it was obvious, wasn't it. <br>
DOCTOR + ROMANA: What was obvious? <br>
DOCTOR: I do beg your pardon. That's my assistant, Romana. <br>
EMILIA: Oh, hello. <br>
ROMANA: Hello. <br>
EMILIA: What a charming name. What's the origin, I wonder? <br>
ROMANA: What was obvious, Professor Rumford? <br>
EMILIA: That there's been a miscount, my dear. <br>
ROMANA: A miscount? <br>
EMILIA: Of the stones. According to Doctor Borlase, the Nine Travellers
here <br>
ROMANA: The Nine Travellers? <br>
EMILIA: Oh, it's a local name for them. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, but there are more than nine stones. <br>
EMILIA: Curious, isn't it. <br>
DOCTOR: So is this. <br>
ROMANA: Yes. <br>
EMILIA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Dried blood, and quite a lot of it. Almost as if something had
had it's throat cut. <br>
(A tall woman in a pink trouser suit thrusts a marker post into the
ground where the Doctor is looking.) <br>
VIVIEN: It probably did. <br>
EMILIA: Oh, Vivien. Doctor, my friend Miss Vivien Fay. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do? You move very quietly, Miss Fay. I didn't hear
you approach. <br>
VIVIEN: I used to be a Brown Owl. <br>
ROMANA: Really? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) The leader of a Brownie pack. Doesn't the blood upset
you, then? <br>
VIVIEN: Oh, it'll probably be just another sacrifice. <br>
(Vivien moves off with her measuring pole and theodolite.) <br>
ROMANA: I thought you told me Earth was civilised now. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. You mean there have been sacrifices before? <br>
VIVIEN: The BIDS are a bit primitive. <br>
ROMANA: The BIDS? <br>
VIVIEN: The British Institute of Druidic Studies. Nothing at all to do
with real Druids, of course, past or present. No, there's a group of
them who come regularly. They all wear white robes and wave bits of
mistletoe and curved knives in the air. It's all very unhistoric. <br>
(The aged Professor Rumford has settled herself on a folding camp
stool.) <br>
EMILIA: Oh, I think you dismiss them a little too easily. <br>
DOCTOR: Why, has there been trouble? <br>
EMILIA: Well, their leader, Mister De Vries, is a very unpleasant man. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>
VIVIEN: Yes. As a matter of fact, we thought you were one of his group.
<br>
DOCTOR: So you don't have anything to do with them, then. <br>
EMILIA: No, no more than we can help. All that mumbo-jumbo nonsense.
No, Vivien and I are conducting a topographical, geological,
astronomical, archeological survey of the site.<br>
DOCTOR: How would I see this Mister De Vries? <br>
EMILIA: Oh, he lives over the hill in the big house. <br>
DOCTOR: I think I'll look him up. <br>
ROMANA: What, now? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
EMILIA: I warn you, Doctor, he doesn't like scientists. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, very few people do, in my experience. Oh, by the way.
Over there we noticed some indentations in the ground made by something
very heavy. <br>
VIVIEN: Oh, it's probably one of the local farmers moving equipment. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, very probably, yes. Over this way, you say? <br>
EMILIA: Yes, you can't miss it. <br>
DOCTOR: How far is it? <br>
EMILIA: Oh, only a couple of miles. <br>
ROMANA: Only? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I did warn you about those shoes. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, you did. <br>
EMILIA: Yes, I see what you mean. They're not very practical, are they.
<br>
ROMANA: Yes, well, I didn't realise <br>
DOCTOR: She wouldn't be told. Look, I tell you what. Why don't you hang
on here and I'll stop off on the way back and bring you some boots,
right? <br>
ROMANA: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Listen. Keep an eye on those two. There's something
very odd going on. <br>
ROMANA: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, I won't be long. Goodbye. <br>
ROMANA: Bye. <br>
(The Doctor leaves.) <br>
VIVIEN: Oh, typical. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
VIVIEN: Typical male. Strands you here in the middle of nowhere with
two complete strangers while he goes off somewhere enjoying himself. <br>
EMILIA: Never mind. You can help us with the work while you're waiting.
<br>
ROMANA: Right. </font></p>

EMILIA: Is that straight? <br>
ROMANA: Yes. <br>
EMILIA: Jolly good. What does that make it? Twenty eight point nine
metres? <br>
ROMANA: Ah ha. <br>
EMILIA: Well, girls, let's have a breather. Take five, as they say. <br>
(A crow screeches overhead and lands on one of the tall uprights.) <br>
ROMANA: What's that? <br>
VIVIEN: Don't be afraid. It's only a crow. <br>
ROMANA: Oh. It looks evil. </font></p>

MARTHA: Oh, Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach. <br>
(A crow arrives.) <br>
DE VRIES: Cailleach, Cailleach, Cailleach. Your spirit fills us. Your
worshippers are our brothers. Your enemies are our enemies. <br>
(He takes the knife out of its sheath.) <br>
DE VRIES: Death to the enemies of the Cailleach! <br>
MARTHA: Death to the enemies of the Cailleach! <br>
(The Doctor arrives at Brewery Row in Little Compton, goes through the
gates and up the drive to Little Compton Manor. A statue of Mercury
stands on a plinth in the Tudor courtyard. He walks up to the door and

DOCTOR: Hello? Anybody home? Any? Nobody home except us Druids. <br>
(The Doctor reads the label on one portrait.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thomas Borlase 1701 to 1754. Oh. Oh, so that's the good doctor.
<br>
DE VRIES: He surveyed the Nine Travellers, but then you probably know
that already, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Mister De Vries. <br>
DE VRIES: Correct. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you know my name? <br>
DE VRIES: It was very sad about Doctor Borlase. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
DE VRIES: Didn't Professor Rumford tell you? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
DE VRIES: One of the stones fell on him just after he completed his
survey. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Maybe we should warn the Professor.&nbsp;<br>
DE VRIES: She's quite safe. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. What about them? <br>
DE VRIES: Those are away being cleaned. One of them's rather fine, by
the Scottish painter Ramsey. Lady Morgana Montcalm. Perhaps you've
heard of her? <br>
(Vivien? Morgana? Uh oh. We must be in Cornwall.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid I haven't. <br>
DE VRIES: The Montcalms owned this land and this house, including the
circle. They used to call her the wicked Lady Montcalm. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>
DE VRIES: She's said to have murdered her husband on her wedding night.
<br>
(Second empty space.) <br>
DE VRIES: That's Mrs Trefusis. She was a recluse. She lived here for
sixty years and never saw a soul. <br>
(Yup, that clinches it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Really. <br>
DE VRIES: And that's a Brazilian lady, or would be if she were here.
Senora Camara. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Was there a Senor Camara? <br>
DE VRIES: He doesn't seem to have survived the crossing from Brazil.
But don't let's stand about here in the hall, Doctor. Do come in. Let
me offer you a glass of sherry. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, thank you. I'd like that. <br>

DOCTOR: That's rather an unusual pet, isn't it? <br>
DE VRIES: It's not exactly what you'd call a pet, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, Mister De Vries, you never told me how you knew my
name. <br>
DE VRIES: Didn't I, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
DE VRIES: You never told me what your interest in the circle is. <br>
DOCTOR: That's true. I'm looking for something. <br>
DE VRIES: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Part of a key. <br>
DE VRIES: A key to what? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's just a key. It's been mislaid. Tell me, you're not
really a Druid, are you. <br>
DE VRIES: Not in the conventional sense, no, but I am a humble student
of Druidic lore. <br>
DOCTOR: That must be very boring. <br>
DE VRIES: Boring? What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I mean there's so little of it that's historically
reliable, is there. The odd mention in Julius Caesar, Tacitus, no great
detail. I always thought that Druidism was founded by John Aubrey in
the seventeenth century as a joke. He had a great sense of humour, John
Aubrey. <br>
DE VRIES: It is no laughing matter. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well that's a pity. What's your interest in the stones?
<br>
DE VRIES: The stones are sacred. <br>
DOCTOR: To whom? <br>
DE VRIES: To one who is mighty and all-powerful. To the Goddess. <br>
DOCTOR: The Goddess? What goddess is that? <br>
DE VRIES: She has many names. Morrigu, Nermintana, the Cailleach. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Celtic, of course. <br>
DE VRIES: Goddess of war, death and magic. Beware the raven or the
crow, Doctor. They are her eyes. <br>
DOCTOR: (to Quoth, the raven) You don't really believe that, do you,
hmm? <br>
DE VRIES: I have seen her power, Doctor. Come. <br>

stone circles in this part of the country. <br>
EMILIA: If I knew that I'd be professor of megalithic archaeology at
Bangor instead of that fool, Idwal Morgan. <br>
ROMANA: Er, there is one thing which does strike me as rather curious.
Well, until recently, the land the circle stands on has always been
owned by a woman. Haven't you noticed? Lady Montcalm, Senora Camara,
Mrs Trefusis. And if you go further back, right in the Middle Ages, it
came under the control of the Mother Superior of the Convent of the
Little Sisters of Saint Gudula. <br>
VIVIEN: What does that prove? Lots of convents and monasteries owned
enormous areas of land in the Middle Ages. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, but here it was women. All women. <br>
VIVIEN: What are you suggesting, Romana? Some kind of sisterhood that's
been worshipping these stones for, when was the convent founded?
Twelfth century, wasn't it? For seven hundred odd years? That's a
little bit hard to believe, isn't it? <br>
ROMANA: What other explanation is there? <br>
VIVIEN: What about Mister De Vries? He doesn't quite qualify as a head
of a sisterhood. <br>
ROMANA: Well maybe he's not really the head. This convent, does it
still exist? <br>
EMILIA: Oh, good heavens, no. And it was a man who saw to that, Henry
the Eighth. It went the way of all flesh with the dissolution of the
monasteries. <br>
ROMANA: What about the convent records? <br>
VIVIEN: Oh, I should think they were destroyed. <br>
EMILIA: Some of them could still be at the hall. <br>
ROMANA: The hall? What hall? <br>
EMILIA: Mister De Vries' house. It was built in 1572 on the old site of
the convent. <br>
ROMANA: Well, let's go and take a look. What are we waiting for? <br>

EMILIA: No. Keep a good fire burning in case the Doctor comes back. Ah,

let me get on with it then? He's a terrible old gasbag. <br>
EMILIA: I still don't understand about hyperspace. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, who does? <br>
K9: I do. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, shut up, K9. It's all to do with interspatial geometry. <br>
EMILIA: Oh, I never studied that. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not surprised. They gave up teaching it two thousand
years ago, even on Gallifrey. <br>
EMILIA: Oh, I beg your pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: Here. Look, how can I explain? Listen, Einstein's Special
Theory of Relativity said <br>
EMILIA: Said that you cannot travel in space faster than the speed of
light, because the speed of light is a limiting factor. If you
travelled more than a hundred and eighty thousand miles per second,
you'd encounter the time distortion effect. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, well, he was nearly right. <br>
EMILIA: In fact, you'd arrive at your destination before you'd left
your starting point. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Absurd, isn't it? <br>
EMILIA: Oh, I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: I always thought it was fun, myself. I did try to explain the
realities to poor old Albert, but he would insist that he knew best. <br>
EMILIA: Oh, they're all the same, these physicists. Oh, sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's all right. I mean, apart from space warping, which
he couldn't possibly understand, there is a theoretical way of avoiding
the time distort. <br>
EMILIA: Is there really? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Just pass me that screwdriver, will you? Yes, you operate
in a different dimension, you see, in another kind of space. <br>
EMILIA: Otherwise, hyperspace. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
EMILIA: But I still don't know where Romana and Vivien are. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. They're still in the circle, or whatever occupies that
space in the other dimension. <br>
EMILIA: Oh, I see. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Perhaps you'll explain it to me sometime when you've got
a few minutes to spare. <br>
EMILIA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
EMILIA: May I ask you a personal question? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don't see how I can stop you asking. <br>
EMILIA: Are you from outer space? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
EMILIA: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm more from what you'd call inner time. <br>
EMILIA: Ah. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, never mind about that now. K9, what do you think of
this? Hmm? Well? <br>
K9: The theory appears to be ingenious. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but will it work? <br>
K9: Affirmative. It will be effective on a setting of point naught
naught three seven on the hyperspace scale. <br>
DOCTOR: What, only on that end of the scale? <br>
K9: Affirmative, master. <br>
DOCTOR: That means it'll burn out the circuits in about ten and a half
seconds flat. <br>
K9: Correction, master. Circuits will burn out after thirty one point
two seven seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: Thirty one point two seven. Is that long enough to get me into
hyperspace? <br>
K9: Insufficient data, master. Answer depends upon where in hyperspace
and what is there when you arrive. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you very much, K9. <br>
K9: Actual area of transportation beam will be small. It is imperative,
therefore, that you mark your point of entry on arrival in order to
facilitate finding it again for return. <br>

DOCTOR: Right. Now remember, you've only got thirty seconds and then
pow! <br>

means that all the microcircuitry will fuse into one great urgh of

EMILIA: Yes, but what happens if the Ogri come back while you're

trial. <br>
MEGARA 2: There has been a trial. <br>

MEGARA: I defended you. <br>
MEGARA 2: I was judge. You were found guilty. <br>
DOCTOR: But I wasn't there. <br>
MEGARA 2: Immaterial. Your counsel was. He was most eloquent on your
behalf. <br>
DOCTOR: I demand the right to defend myself. <br>
MEGARA 2: Not permitted. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
MEGARA: You are a humanoid and therefore quite incapable of
appreciating the subtleties of the law. <br>
DOCTOR: Machine law. <br>
MEGARA 2: But of course. There is no other law. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. I see. Just a minute. <br>
MEGARA: As your counsel, my advice to you is to submit to execution. So
much easier in the end. <br>
DOCTOR: I wish to appeal against my sentence. <br>

DOCTOR: Ahem. Could we get back to my appeal, please? <br>
MEGARA 2: In accordance with article fourteen of the legal code,
subsection one three five, this humanoid's execution is stayed for two
hours while we graciously consent to hear his appeal. Afterwards, the

(The Doctor enters the Tardis. Romana and Emilia walk along a track,
carrying the hyperspace window generator.) <br>
EMILIA: Poor Vivien. I can't help feeling sorry for her, but she hasn't
finished making trouble yet. <br>
ROMANA: What do you mean? <br>
EMILIA: The Nine Travellers. They'll have to be surveyed all over
again. Oh, that'll put the cat amongst the pigeons, believe me. <br>
DOCTOR: Professor, you could write a monograph about it. <br>
EMILIA: Ah yes, and make Idwal Morgan look a fool. <br>
ROMANA: Will you write everything that happened? <br>
EMILIA: Certainly not. I do have my academic reputation to consider.
Funny, I never noticed a police box there before. <br>
ROMANA: Goodbye, Professor, and thank you for everything. <br>
(Romana joins the Doctor and K9 in the Tardis.) <br>
EMILIA: Goodbye? Where <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
EMILIA: I do have my academic reputation to consider. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Romana gets the two pieces of the Key out of the
safe.) <br>
DOCTOR: The tracer. <br>
(She hands it over. The Doctor touches the pendant.) <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, is Earth always like that? <br>
(The pendant transforms into another polygon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sometimes it's even exciting. <br>
ROMANA: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Now. <br>
(He tries to fit the three pieces together, and fails.) </font></p>
