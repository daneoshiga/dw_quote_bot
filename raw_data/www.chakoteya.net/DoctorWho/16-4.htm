<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (As the time rotor goes gently up and down, the
Doctor is lying on the floor playing chess with K9.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rook to bishop's four. <br>
(He stops his clock and starts K9's.) <br>
DOCTOR: I saw Capablanca make that move against Alekhine in 1927. <br>
K9: He lost, master. <br>
DOCTOR: Who? <br>
K9: Capablanca. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you sure? <br>
K9: Master, I have been programmed with all the Championship games
since 1866. Capablanca lost. <br>
DOCTOR: I must have been called away. Are you really sure? <br>
K9: King to knight's two. <br>
(The Doctor moves the white King for him.) <br>
DOCTOR: King to knight's two. King? That's a terrible move. You've
weakened the king's side. <br>
K9: Clock, master. <br>
DOCTOR: I know, I know. I'll check your programming sometime. We're not
supposed to be playing draughts, you know. <br>
K9: Master. <br>
(Romana enters, wearing her original long white gown.) <br>
ROMANA: What are you doing, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. We're playing chess. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, I can see that, but aren't you forgetting something? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so. <br>
ROMANA: What about our task? The Key to Time, remember? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that old thing. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, that old thing. The Guardian did stress the need for
urgency, didn't he? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
ROMANA: I'll do it. <br>
DOCTOR: If you must. <br>
(Romana puts the tracer into the hole in the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: I just feel I deserve a little break. After all, we've got half
the segments. I prefer to play chess. <br>
ROMANA: Really. Materialisation in fifteen seconds. Mate in twelve. <br>
K9: Correction, mistress. Eleven. <br>
ROMANA: Eleven? Oh yes. Sorry, K9. <br>
K9: Apologies are unnecessary, mistress. <br>
DOCTOR: Mate in eleven? Oh yes, oh yes. Well, that's the trouble with
chess, isn't it. It's all so predictable. <br>
ROMANA: Materialisation commencing now. Five, four, three, two, one. <br>
(Romana gently pulls back a control and the Tardis appears amongst a
stand of silver birch.) <br>
ROMANA: Was that smooth enough for you, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
ROMANA: I said, was that smooth enough? <br>
DOCTOR: Mate in eleven? What, have we arrived? Oh good. Where? <br>
ROMANA: Tara. <br>
DOCTOR: Tara? <br>
ROMANA: Earth-type gravity, oxygen atmosphere, climate, temperate. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Peaceful looking place. That shouldn't give you too much
trouble. <br>
ROMANA: Me? <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's rather beautiful, don't you? Very good for. Yes, I
think it would be. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Shouldn't you be getting changed? <br>
ROMANA: Oh yes, all right. </font></p>

ROMANA: No. Tally ho. Tara! <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor opens a cupboard directly in front of
the camera and removes a bunch of fake flowers and a pair of
binoculars.) <br>
ROMANA [OC]: What are you looking for? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's in here somewhere. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: I said, what are you looking for? <br>
DOCTOR: Aha! Aha! Goody. Gosh, that takes me back. <br>
(It's a fishing rod.) <br>
DOCTOR: Or forward. That's the trouble with time travel, you can never
remember. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Last time I used this, I was with Isaak Walton. Yes. Yes, it's
all here. <br>
(Romana enters in her new satin semi-cossack outfit - calf length coat
over green trousers tucked into leather boots, and matching top hat
with green trim. It's a Mary Tamm exclusive design.) <br>
ROMANA: Well, how do you like it? Good. According to our records, it's
what everyone on Tara's wearing this year. Isn't that right, K9? <br>
K9: Affirmative. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There are sounds of the jungle, with monkeys
chattering and birds of paradise calling, and the tracer clicking like
crazy.) <br>
ROMANA: Aha. <br>
DOCTOR: Aha. <br>
ROMANA: Where are you going? <br>
DOCTOR: Fishing. <br>
ROMANA: Fishing? What's fishing? <br>
DOCTOR: Fishing? It's an art, worthy of the knowledge and practise of a
wise man. Isaak Walton <br>
ROMANA: Look, we haven't got time for you to practise anything. We've
got to find the fourth segment. <br>
DOCTOR: You find it. I'm taking the day off. <br>
ROMANA: The day off? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. After a journey of four hundred years and twelve parsecs,
I'm allowed a rest of fifty years. <br>
ROMANA: Where does it say that? <br>
DOCTOR: Section ninety three, paragraph two, laws governing Time Lords.
You look it up. Go on. <br>
ROMANA: What? You just made that up. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[By the river]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROMANA: But you can't just spent the fifty years
fishing. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course not. I'd get bored. I just propose to spend the
next couple of hours fishing. <br>
ROMANA: But what about the fourth segment? <br>
DOCTOR: You get it. <br>
ROMANA: Right, I will. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you do that. It's a lovely day, beautiful countryside. The
walk will do you good. <br>
ROMANA: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you just mind standing aside, please? You're casting a
shadow. It frightens the fish. <br>
ROMANA: Frightens the fish. Look, I'm going to get that fourth segment
and I'll be back here in under an hour. You be ready to leave. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Woodland garden]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Romana leaves the Doctor, and crosses a small
stream by some handy stepping stones. She follows the tracer signal
through a well-tended piece of woodland. Something is watching here,
hidden by the giant rhubarb leaves. It growls. Finally she comes to a
statue near a semi-derelict mill. It is a rough image, either of
Michael and the devil or George and the dragon. Same basic design - man
with spear and shield standing victorious over a dead monster. Romana
touches the creature's snout and it transforms into the fourth segment.
That was far too easy. An ape-like creature with massive canine teeth
appears out of the giant rhubarb. Romana backs away, and a man in
armour comes to her rescue.) <br>
GRENDEL: Here, beast! <br>
(His rapier gives off an electric charge with each hit. The creature
retreats across the stream. Romana's rescuer lifts his visor to reveal
himself as a man of middle years with neatly trimmed moustache and
small beard.) <br>
GRENDEL: It's incredible! <br>
ROMANA: I don't know how to thank you. If you hadn't have come along
when you did, that beast would have got me. What's your name? <br>
GRENDEL: My name? Er, you're not damaged in any way? <br>
ROMANA: No, no, I just stumbled slightly, that's all. <br>
GRENDEL: Your head isn't injured? <br>
ROMANA: No, I don't think so. There's no harm done. I'm sorry if you're
somebody frightfully important, but I'm a stranger here, you see. My
name's Romana. <br>
GRENDEL: Ah, the fair Romana. That's a pretty name. <br>
ROMANA: Thank you. Tell me, are there many creatures like that around
here? I understood that the fauna of Tara were supposed to be friendly.
<br>
GRENDEL: I always keep some beasts in my woods to hunt, but they don't
usually attack people unless they're frightened in some way. <br>
ROMANA: Your woods? <br>
GRENDEL: Yes. These are part of the estates of Gracht. What a curiously
shaped stone. <br>
(He takes the fourth segment.) <br>
ROMANA: Yes. <br>
(Romana stumbles reaching for it.) <br>
GRENDEL: Oh, have you hurt your ankle? <br>
ROMANA: No, no, it's nothing, really. Could I have my stone, please? <br>
GRENDEL: Of course, as soon as its been registered. <br>
ROMANA: Registered? <br>
GRENDEL: Yes. Do you not know the law? <br>
ROMANA: No. As I said, I'm a stranger here. <br>
GRENDEL: The law decrees that all minerals, particularly unusual ones
like of this kind, must be registered with the Knight of Castle Gracht.
<br>
ROMANA: Who's that? <br>
GRENDEL: Me. I am Count Grendel, Knight of Gracht, Master of the Sword.
<br>
ROMANA: Oh, I see. <br>
GRENDEL: What's happened to the statue? <br>
ROMANA: Is it important? <br>
GRENDEL: Only to superstitious fools. <br>
ROMANA: Oh? <br>
GRENDEL: It's our family emblem. At least, it was. It's supposed to
guard our fortunes. How very odd. <br>
ROMANA: Look, I'm sorry, but I really must <br>
GRENDEL: It's of no importance. What is important is to get that ankle
of your attended to. <br>
ROMANA: It's nothing, really. <br>
GRENDEL: I shall take you to my castle. My steward can register your
stone while my surgeon attends to your injury. <br>
ROMANA: Look, it's very kind of you, but I really couldn't <br>
GRENDEL: Then I shall provide you with a mount and an escort to take
you wherever you wish. <br>
ROMANA: It's just a question of time. <br>
GRENDEL: An hour, no more. What's an hour out of your life? <br>
(Grendel picks up Romana in his arms.) <br>
GRENDEL: I shall not take no for an answer. <br>
(Grendel carries Romana to his steed, a white horse that is waiting
patiently for him.) <br>
ROMANA: What's that? Is it yours? <br>
GRENDEL: My favourite charger. Strong as a tree and swift as the wind. <br>
ROMANA: Well, how does it go? What makes it work? <br>
GRENDEL: Good heavens, I don't know, my dear. <br>
ROMANA: You don't? <br>
GRENDEL: I'm a knight, not a farrier. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[By the river]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is wakened by the smell of burning
from his hat brim. A young knight has touched one of those electric
rapiers to it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mind not standing on my chest? My hat's on fire. I don't
think we've met before. <br>
(A second older man speaks.) <br>
ZADEK: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
ZADEK: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Call me Doctor. <br>
ZADEK: What are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, fishing. <br>
ZADEK: This is Prince Reynart's hunting estate. <br>
(The Doctor leaps to his feet.) <br>
DOCTOR: What? Prince Reynart? <br>
ZADEK: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: I've never heard of him. Decent sort of chap, is he? <br>
FARRAH: Shall I kill him, Swordmaster? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, that won't be necessary. <br>
(The Doctor accidentally touches the tip of the rapier and gets a
shock. He takes the weapon from the young man.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good heavens, electrically charged. The control's in the hilt,
I see. <br>
(He hands the rapier back.) <br>
ZADEK: You know about such things? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've travelled. <br>
FARRAH: He said he was a doctor. <br>
ZADEK: You know about machines, electronics? <br>
DOCTOR: A little. <br>
ZADEK: You don't look like a peasant. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course not. I've travelled. <br>
ZADEK: But you have certain skills. Can you mend an android? <br>
DOCTOR: What? What did you just say? <br>
ZADEK: An android. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought you said an android. What's wrong with it? <br>
ZADEK: It won't go. <br>
DOCTOR: Why don't you just try your local android dealer? <br>
FARRAH: Shall I kill him now, Swordmaster? <br>
DOCTOR: Look, that isn't necessary. You see, I'd really love to help
you out but I'm frightfully busy and where is this android? </font></p>

towers stuck on for effect.) <br>
GRENDEL: There is Castle Gracht, my dear. <br>
ROMANA: It's beautiful. <br>
GRENDEL: It's the ancient home of the Grendels of Gracht. And it's
quite, quite escape-proof, I'm glad to say. </font></p>

TILL: My lord is come! Open the gate! <br>
(The big double gates swing open as Grendel and Romana ride across the
moat bridge and into the courtyard. The gates swing silently closed
again afterwards. Grendel lifts Romana down from the horse.) <br>
GRENDEL: There, that wasn't too bad, was it? <br>
ROMANA: There's no need to carry me. I can still walk. <br>
TILL: Master. <br>
GRENDEL: Fetch Madame Lamia. <br>
TILL: Master. <br>
GRENDEL: She's my surgeon. Come, my dear. </font></p>

over an examination couch, computers and earthenware jugs, chemical
retorts and a carved wooden chair. Grendel carries Romana in and lays
her on the couch.) <br>
GRENDEL: There. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, thank you. You won't forget to register my stone, will you?
<br>
GRENDEL: What? <br>
ROMANA: My stone. <br>
GRENDEL: Oh, no, no, of course not, my dear. <br>
(A woman enters.) <br>
LAMIA: I got your message. <br>
GRENDEL: Oh, Romana, my dear, this is Madame Lamia, my
surgeon-engineer. <br>
ROMANA: Hello. Engineer? <br>
LAMIA: I don't believe it. <br>
(Lamia examines Romana's head.) <br>
ROMANA: What's the matter? <br>
LAMIA: It's incredible. It's a marvellous job. Who did it? <br>
GRENDEL: The question is not so much who, my dear, as why. <br>
LAMIA: I'm a peasant. I leave politics to my betters. <br>
GRENDEL: Very wise of you, my dear. <br>
ROMANA: Now look, I don't know what all this is about, but I must <br>
GRENDEL: Restrain her. <br>
(Lamia takes a box from her pocket and presses a button. Curved bars
come out of the couch and over Romana's chest and ankles.) <br>
LAMIA: What do you want me to do with her, my lord? <br>
GRENDEL: Well, we can't have her running around the kingdom.
Disassemble her. We can cannibalise her for parts. <br>
ROMANA: What parts? Now, wait a minute. <br>
GRENDEL: I should like to keep the head. You're right, it really is
quite remarkable. <br>
(Lamia picks up an electric carving knife.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Ahem, you're standing on my scarf. <br>
FARRAH: I'm terribly sorry. <br>
(Farrah cuts through the scarf with his rapier.) <br>
DOCTOR: If you don't stop burning my scarf, you're going to have to
kill me. <br>
(An elegant man enters with Zadek.) <br>
REYNART: Doctor, you must forgive Swordsman Farrah. He tends to get
overenthusiastic in the pursuit of his duties. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps he does <br>
REYNART: But particularly in defence of his prince. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, maybe he does get too enthusiastic in the course of his
duty. What about my scarf? <br>
ZADEK: Peasant, you will speak with respect when you address Prince
Reynart of Tara. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you, I'm not a peasant. <br>
REYNART: But you do know about androids. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that depends. <br>
ZADEK: On what? <br>
REYNART: On how we treat him, obviously. <br>
(The Doctor sits, and gets another near miss with Farrah's rapier. He
stands again.) <br>
REYNART: So you're not a peasant. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
REYNART: Very well, I'll make you an offer. One thousand gold pieces if
you can mend our android. <br>
DOCTOR: One thousand gold pieces? Pfft. Do you think you can buy me for
money? Ha! Five hundred. <br>
REYNART: Done. <br>
DOCTOR: Suppose I can't mend the android? <br>
ZADEK: Then we shall give you to Swordsman Farrah for sword practice. <br>
REYNART: No, we won't, Zadek. This man is obviously a gentleman. If he
can mend our android, we shall reward him. If he cannot, you have my
word, Doctor, you will come to no harm. You may go free. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(The Doctor opens the front door. There is a swordsman standing there.)
<br>
REYNART: Wait. The android? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes. Where? Excuse me. <br>
Reynart goes to the other side of the room and removes a blanket from a
faceless android wearing similar clothes to Lamia.) <br>
REYNART: There he is, Doctor. <br>

GRENDEL: I always enjoy watching you work, my dear. <br>
LAMIA: Thank you, my lord. I shall make the cut here. <br>
GRENDEL: Excellent. <br>
ROMANA: Count, far be it from me to query this lady's competency as a
doctor, but where I come from you don't cut off the patient's head if
you wish to cure their ankle! <br>
LAMIA: Ankle? <br>
GRENDEL: Yes, there was supposed to be something wrong with its ankle. <br>
(Lamia removes Romana's right boot.) <br>
LAMIA: It's swollen. <br>
ROMANA: Well, what did you expect? <br>
LAMIA: Extraordinary. If I didn't know better, my lord. <br>
(Lamia checks the back of Romana's head.) <br>
LAMIA: She is not an android.&nbsp;<br>

LAMIA: She is real. <br>
ROMANA: Brilliant. <br>
GRENDEL: Well, you can keep your head, my dear. I may have a better use
for it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: That's not bad. I have seen better. <br>
REYNART: Don't you sometimes wish, Zadek, that our fathers had
permitted us to learn peasant skills? <br>
ZADEK: No, your highness. If we'd have meant to have been peasants,
we'd have been born peasants. <br>
REYNART: Perhaps you're right, Zadek. Well, Doctor, can it be fixed? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that depends. Fixed for what? <br>
REYNART: Zadek. <br>
(Zadek fetches a box.) <br>
REYNART: For one thing, it must wear this. <br>
(A Reynart face mask.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
REYNART: Tomorrow, at the appropriate hour fixed by the astrologers, in
the great Coronation room of the Palace of Tara, I am to be crowned
King. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, congratulations. <br>
REYNART: They will be in order if I get there. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? What's to stop you? <br>
REYNART: Count Grendel of Gracht. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
REYNART: He'll kill me if he needs to. After all, you can't crown a
dead Prince. Grendel and his men will be watching every entrance to the
palace to prevent my getting to the Coronation room at the ordained
time. <br>
DOCTOR: So? <br>
REYNART: If I fail to appear at the right moment, I forfeit my right to
the crown. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. And that's when Grendel of Gracht steps in? <br>
REYNART: The only other contender for the throne is the Princess
Strella, but she disappeared some time ago. Nobody knows where she is. <br>
DOCTOR: Where does George come into all this? <br>
ZADEK: There have been three attempts on his Highness's life already.
The next one could be successful. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. Let them attack George here instead of the Prince. <br>
REYNART: Precisely. We use George, the android copy of me to create a
diversion, to distract their attention. <br>
DOCTOR: And draw their fire. <br>
REYNART: To draw their fire, while we slip past the guards into the
Coronation room. What do you think, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it has been done before. </font></p>

her right sleeve while Grendel and Lamia talk.) <br>
LAMIA: I don't like it. <br>
GRENDEL: I'm not asking you to like it, just do it. <br>
LAMIA: Is it wise? Think of the risk. <br>
GRENDEL: You question my commands? <br>
LAMIA: No, my lord, of course not. <br>
GRENDEL: Then do what I tell you or I shall have you flogged, and don't
imagine that I won't. <br>
LAMIA: Yes, my lord. <br>

REYNART: Excellent! Farrah, bring wine. Do you know, it's quite eerie
seeing oneself walk and talk like that. I never thought I'd see that
thing going again. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it'll do for now, but if I'd had the proper tools I could
have done a much better job. <br>
REYNART: It's good enough to fool Grendel and his men, don't you think
so, Zadek? <br>
ZADEK: I hope so, your Highness, for our sake. <br>
REYNART: Oh, Zadek, always the pessimist. Thank you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: My pleasure. <br>
REYNART: Zadek. <br>
(Zadek puts a heavy leather pouch on the table.) <br>
ZADEK: Five hundred gold pieces. <br>
REYNART: You wouldn't be interested in permanent employment, would you,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm otherwise engaged. <br>
(Farrah returns with a tray with a flagon and goblets.) <br>
REYNART: Pity. Still, you will stay and drink a toast to our success
for tomorrow, won't you? <br>
DOCTOR: All right. <br>
REYNART: One of our local wines. Modest, demure, but palatable. Join
us, Farrah. <br>
FARRAH: Thank you, your Highness. <br>
DOCTOR: You look better without your helmet. <br>
FARRAH: Cooler, anyway. <br>
ZADEK: With your permission, your Highness. To the King. <br>
DOCTOR: To the King. <br>
FARRAH: To the King. <br>
REYNART: Not yet. Tomorrow, perhaps, thanks to the Doctor. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FARRAH: Wake up! <br>
DOCTOR: So much for the local wine. <br>
(Farrah has his rapier at the Doctor's throat.) <br>
FARRAH: Wake up, you traitor! <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
FARRAH: Traitor! <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
FARRAH: I want you to be totally conscious when I kill you. <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't you got anything better to do? <br>
FARRAH: There's only one thing preventing me from running you through
right now. <br>
(Farrah drags the Doctor to his feet.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's that? <br>
FARRAH: Where is he? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know what you're talking about. <br>
ZADEK: That's enough, Farrah. Doctor, the Prince has gone. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Where? <br>
ZADEK: Vanished. He's been kidnapped. <br>
DOCTOR: By whom? <br>
FARRAH: Your master, Count Grendel, of course! <br>
DOCTOR: But I don't even know who Count Grendel is! <br>
ZADEK: I'm inclined to believe you, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor dashes to the curtained alcove, where the android is still
lying.) <br>
FARRAH: But Swordmaster <br>
ZADEK: Why should he remain when the Prince has been taken? It doesn't
make sense. <br>
DOCTOR: Well at least he didn't take the android. <br>
ZADEK: They took the real Prince. What use is the copy? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that depends on what you're going to do. <br>
ZADEK: What honour demands. <br>
DOCTOR: And what's that? <br>
ZADEK: Farrah and I will take our swords and do battle with the Count's
men. <br>
DOCTOR: What? What, just the two of you? <br>
FARRAH: A swordsman does not fear death if he dies with honour. <br>
DOCTOR: Then he's an idiot. Listen, let me see if I understand this. In
order to be crowned King, the Prince must present himself in the
Coronation room at a specific time, right? <br>
ZADEK: Correct. <br>
DOCTOR: Then you've got no problem. Excuse me. <br>
(The Doctor sits in the Prince's chair.) <br>
DOCTOR: You take it to the Coronation room and get it crowned. <br>
FARRAH: Crown an android King of Tara? Never! <br>
DOCTOR: Would you rather crown Count Grendel of Gracht? <br>
FARRAH: But an android. It's unthinkable. <br>
ZADEK: In any case, Grendel's men will see that we don't get into the
Coronation room. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don't suppose the King was going to walk in through the
front door, was he? <br>
ZADEK: He had a plan. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. What? <br>
ZADEK: There is a secret passage. <br>
DOCTOR: Aha, I thought there might be something like that. How secret?
Would Grendel know about it? <br>
ZADEK: I hope not. <br>
DOCTOR: So do I. Right, now listen. I'll do some more work on George,
you get him to the Coronation room, get him crowned, and while he's
ruling the country you two can find the real Prince. I mean, that's
worth a try, isn't it? <br>
ZADEK: Doctor, I see only two objections to your plan. <br>
DOCTOR: Only two? <br>
ZADEK: What if the android breaks down? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, I can't guarantee you anything, but if I had the
proper tools <br>
ZADEK: Second problem, security. <br>
DOCTOR: Security? But only the three of us need even know of George's
existence. <br>
ZADEK: Precisely. Farrah I can trust. <br>
DOCTOR: And by the time George is King, I'll be light years away. <br>
ZADEK: No, Doctor. You'll be with the android at all times. <br>
DOCTOR: Now look here, Zadek. I've got better things to do than meddle
in the politics of your piffling little planet. <br>
(Farrah puts his electric rapier close to the Doctor's face.) <br>
DOCTOR: On the other hand, I could be with the android at all times. </font></p>

computer wakes up in the Tardis.) <br>
FARRAH: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Calling my dog. <br>
FARRAH: I don't see any dog. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course not. He hasn't arrived yet. </font></p>

ZADEK: Doctor? You've checked the android? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, as far as I can without the proper tools. <br>
ZADEK: Everything is functioning correctly? <br>
DOCTOR: No. His micro-circuitry's not perfect and his power packs need
a boost. <br>
ZADEK: I have great confidence in you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm deeply touched. <br>
ZADEK: But remember, either Farrah or myself will be with you at all
times. Don't let us down. <br>
(A bird screeches outside. Farrah and the Doctor go to the window.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't draw that sword. <br>
(The Doctor opens the door and K9 trundles in.) <br>
K9: You called, master? <br>
ZADEK: What is that thing? <br>
DOCTOR: That thing? That's my dog. <br>
ZADEK: But it's a machine. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, so is your Prince. <br>
(The Doctor kicks the chair the android is sitting on, and Farrah
reacts.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't draw that sword! <br>
(Farrah's hand and rapier are caught in an energy field.) <br>
DOCTOR: K9? K9? <br>
(The energy field stops and Farrah drops the rapier. The Doctor picks
it up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, I don't like to say I told you so, but I told you so. Do
put it away, quickly. K9, where's Romana? <br>
K9: She has not yet returned, master. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Where is she? <br>
K9: Insufficient data to formulate a reply. She's not within range of
my sensors. <br>
DOCTOR: But she was only meant to be gone an hour. <br>
ZADEK: You've lost someone? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, my assistant. She was looking for something. <br>
ZADEK: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing important. <br>
ZADEK: Where was she last seen? <br>
DOCTOR: Where you picked me up yesterday. <br>
FARRAH: Which way was she going? <br>
DOCTOR: Up the hill. <br>
FARRAH: Towards Count Grendel's lands. <br>
ZADEK: I'm afraid, Doctor, that it sounds as though she might have
fallen into the hands of the Count. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GRENDEL: So, the lovely lady wakes. <br>
ROMANA: How long have I been unconscious? <br>
GRENDEL: Twelve hours, my dear. I trust you slept well. Release her. <br>
ROMANA: Twelve hours? Oh, no. <br>
GRENDEL: Why, what's the matter, my dear? <br>
ROMANA: Look, why don't you just let me go? I've no money and I'm not
worth ransoming. Why did you bring me here? <br>
GRENDEL: Do you think I'm a common bandit? <br>
ROMANA: I'm not even Taran. What possible use can I be to you? <br>
GRENDEL: I'll show you. Help her down. <br>
(Lamia helps Romana get off the couch.) <br>
GRENDEL: Come with me. I want you to see something. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Grendel leads Romana and Lamia down steps to a
dark vaulted area, where a guard stands by a door.)&nbsp;<br>
GRENDEL: And how is our guest? <br>
GUARD: She's well, my lord. <br>
GRENDEL: Good. Let's see for ourselves. <br>
(Grendel slides open a panel in the door.) <br>
GRENDEL: Take a look, my dear. <br>
(Romana looks into the cell.) <br>
ROMANA: Oh! It's incredible! <br>
GRENDEL: Yes, the resemblance is extraordinary, isn't it? <br>
(In the cell, an exact double of Romana is sitting sewing a tapestry.) <br>
ROMANA: Is it an android? <br>
GRENDEL: Good heavens, no, my dear. That's the Princess Strella. First
Lady of Tara, a descendant of the Royal House, Mistress of the domains
of Thorvald, Mortgarde and Freya. In fact, Tara's most eligible
spinster, shortly to become, in rapid succession, my fiancée, my bride,
and then deceased. Yes, it will be a tragic accident. A flower blighted
in its prime. And naturally, as her husband, I shall claim her estates
and her position as second in line to the throne, as provided for under
Taran law. <br>
ROMANA: I see. But since you've already got a princess, what do you
need me for? <br>
GRENDEL: Well, the Princess does not entirely agree with my plan. <br>
ROMANA: I can't say I'm wildly surprised. <br>
GRENDEL: In fact, she quite refuses to cooperate. <br>
ROMANA: Good for her. But I still don't see what all this has got to do
with me. <br>
GRENDEL: Don't you, my dear? I should have thought that was obvious. If
she goes on refusing, I can marry you instead in front of the great
assembly of the nobles of Tara, who won't know the difference. <br>
ROMANA: What happens if I refuse, too? <br>
GRENDEL: Oh, but you won't. Aren't I a lucky man to have two such
beautiful women as my bride? <br>
ROMANA: Apparently your staff doesn't agree. <br>
GRENDEL: She's prejudiced, my dear, just because I once showed her a
certain courtesy. That's the trouble with peasants these days. They
don't know their place any more. Open! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Grendel enters a second cell in his dungeons.
Prince Reynart is lying on a cot with a metal shackle around his neck,
chained to the wall.) <br>
REYNART: Why don't you kill me, Grendel, and get it over with. <br>
GRENDEL: Never rush your pleasures, my dear Reynart. Besides, I've
brought someone to see you. Meet his Royal Highness, Prince Reynart,
first in line to the throne of Tara. <br>
REYNART: Strella! <br>
ROMANA: No, I'm not Strella. I just look like her. My name's Romana. <br>
GRENDEL: You see, my dear Reynart, when I play for high stakes I like
to hold all the cards. <br>
ROMANA: You won't be holding this one much longer. He's ill. He's
running a fever. <br>
GRENDEL: That's why we brought him a permanent nurse for his bedside.
Hold her, Kurster. Lamia. <br>
(Grendel's equivalent of Zadek grabs Romana while Lamia puts a shackle
around Romana's neck.) <br>
REYNART: Let her go! <br>
GRENDEL: Don't be so tediously heroic, my dear fellow. Not too tight,
Lamia. We don't want to choke her. <br>
LAMIA: She is secure, my lord. <br>
GRENDEL: Good. <br>
(Kurster fastens Romana's chain to the wall.) <br>
GRENDEL: You know, my dear Reynart, you ought to thank me. <br>
REYNART: For what? <br>
GRENDEL: For what? For finding you such a charming nurse. There. Take
good care of our royal guest, my dear. Watch them, Kurster. <br>
KURSTER: Yes, my lord. <br>
GRENDEL: And now, my friend, I must go to your coronation. It's a pity
you will miss it. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Where is Count Grendel's castle? <br>
ZADEK: About eight leagues from here. <br>
DOCTOR: Eight leagues. <br>
ZADEK: You're not thinking of going there alone? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, where else might he have taken her if not there? <br>
ZADEK: To Tara itself. He will want to make sure that no one else
claims the throne. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. K9, you take the castle. I'll go to Tara with George. <br>
FARRAH: You're going to help us then? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course. Anyway, we need Zadek to get us into the
palace, right? <br>
ZADEK: Correct, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: K9, off you go. Find out if Romana's there and report straight
back to me. Come on, off you go. <br>

DOCTOR: Who is. <br>

FARRAH: Are you all right, sir? How do you feel? (no reply) I can't
talk to androids. Is he all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. <br>
FARRAH: He's not talking. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've switched off his communication mechanism to conserve
power. <br>
FARRAH: He'll have to make a speech at his coronation. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, he'll make a speech. Don't worry. It won't be a
long one, but he'll make a speech. <br>
FARRAH: I don't know what it is about androids. I know it's silly. You
know what I mean. <br>

ZADEK: They were plague tunnels built about two hundred years ago to
allow the royal court to move in and out of the palace without having
to pass through the contaminated city. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
ZADEK: The great plague wiped out nine tenths of the population. <br>
FARRAH: That's when the survivors started using androids to replace the
people. <br>

(The royal guard commander nods, and the guards leave.) <br>
KURSTER: Take up your place. Come on. <br>

Room, lit with stained glass windows, and mounts the steps to the
golden throne. He sits, laughs, and leaves. The pursuit continues

salutes Grendel.) <br>
GRENDEL: Well? <br>
KURSTER: Everything is ready, my lord. <br>
GRENDEL: The peasants are prepared? <br>
KURSTER: I have my men dressed as peasants, my lord. As soon as it is
announced that the Prince has not appeared for the coronation, there
will be a spontaneous demonstration of love and loyalty to the House of
Gracht. <br>
GRENDEL: I think I shall reject the crown once. Rejecting it twice
might be misconstrued. Besides, I'm not sure I can trust the
Archimandrite to offer it to me a third time. <br>
(The Archimandrite enters from the Coronation Room. He is a small but
dignified figure with a neat silver beard and multicoloured turban, who
has the role of the Archbishop of Canterbury in these matters.) <br>

GRENDEL: It does indeed, your Eminence. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Where is the Prince? <br>

choose to be King of Tara will immediately be offered the protection of
my guard. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Your guard? These are your men? <br>
GRENDEL: Er, the palace guard proved to be indisposed. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: I see. Perhaps, in the circumstances, it would be
simpler if I offered you the crown immediately. <br>
GRENDEL: An excellent suggestion, my dear Archimandrite. It would avoid
a great deal of possible unpleasantness later. But we must wait for the
exact moment. Everything must be done correctly. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Noble sentiments, Count. Nobly spoken. <br>

NOBLES: Hail! Hail to the King! <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Your Majesty. The speech of accession. You must say it. <br>

GEORGE: My subjects, I acknowledge your salutations and I swear that I

GRENDEL: Take care what you say, Zadek. Your Eminence, I suggest we
postpone the oath-taking for the time being. Who knows how many other
programmed androids there may be. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: You think there are more? <br>

GRENDEL: It is not for you to say. <br>
ZADEK: As Commander of His Majesty's bodyguard, it is my decision and

wine, dog! <br>
(Till hurries out. A guard shows the Archimandrite in.) <br>
GRENDEL: Ah, Archimandrite. Welcome. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: What is so urgent that I must leave my duties and hurry
here like this? <br>
GRENDEL: I'm sorry, Archimandrite, but there is a ceremony you must
perform. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Here? What ceremony? <br>
GRENDEL: A marriage. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Your own chaplain could have done that. <br>
GRENDEL: Not this marriage. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Why? Who is to be married, and to whom? <br>
GRENDEL: The King to the Princess Strella. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: The King? Here? <br>
GRENDEL: He has placed himself under my protection, your Eminence.
Sadly, I have to tell you he is sick. In fact, he's very near to death.
<br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Oh, dear, dear, dear. He did not look well at the
coronation. Not himself at all. <br>
GRENDEL: No. No, I did note that, Archimandrite. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: But near to death, you say? <br>
GRENDEL: Indeed he is. It would be as well if you stayed here. I fear
he will be in need of the funeral rites very soon after the wedding. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: Oh, how sad. <br>
GRENDEL: Mmm, yes. And after the funeral rites, there will be a second
wedding for you to perform. <br>
ARCHIMANDRITE: A second wedding? May I ask whose that will be? <br>
GRENDEL: My own. I shall be marrying the poor King's widow. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FARRAH: But surely, sir, we have a supply problem
if we place the batteries there. <br>
ZADEK: But if we do what you're suggesting, we expose our left flank. <br>
DOCTOR: How long do you think the siege will last, Zadek? <br>
ZADEK: Hard to say. The last siege of the Castle of Gracht went on for
nearly two years. <br>
DOCTOR: Two years? Well, we haven't got two years before Grendel kills
both the King and Romana. Anyway, looking at that plan, I'd say there's
only one way into the castle. <br>
ZADEK: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: If someone on the inside opens the main gate and a group of our
men, under cover of darkness, take the guard by surprise. <br>
FARRAH: That's hardly ethical. <br>
ZADEK: Have you ever known Grendel abide by the rules of war? But who's
going to open the gates? <br>
DOCTOR: Me. <br>
ZADEK: One man alone? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. One man and his dog. Come on, K9. </font></p>

STRELLA: Grendel. <br>
GRENDEL: I have come to offer you one last chance to change your mind. <br>
STRELLA: Never. <br>
GRENDEL: The Archimandrite is here, the King is here. It will be quite
easy for you. <br>
STRELLA: Grendel, I've told you already. I will never marry you under
any circumstances, and I will not marry the King under these
circumstances. <br>
GRENDEL: Come, come, my dear. Don't you want to be Queen? <br>
STRELLA: I know, Grendel, that as long as I refuse to marry the King,
his life is safe. <br>
GRENDEL: Huh. And that matters to you? <br>
STRELLA: More than my own life. For the last time, I will not go
through any marriage under your roof. You can kill me if you like. <br>
GRENDEL: Very well, my dear, I may just do that before long. You have
become dispensable, Princess. <br>

ROMANA: Very weak. <br>
GRENDEL: Oh, what a shame. I fear he's not long for this world. <br>
ROMANA: Nonsense. All he needs is some proper medical <br>
GRENDEL: I know exactly what he needs, my dear. Just as long as he's
the strength left for a little ceremony. <br>
REYNART: Never. Do you hear me, Grendel? Never. <br>
GRENDEL: Oh, what a pity, because I'm sure you wouldn't want to be the
cause of Princess Strella's death, would you? <br>
REYNART: What do you mean? <br>
GRENDEL: Or you, my dear. <br>
ROMANA: What are you saying? <br>
GRENDEL: The Princess, the real Princess, that is, is in the next
dungeon. For the moment she's quite safe. <br>
REYNART: If you harm her, Grendel <br>
GRENDEL: What! What can you do? Be quiet and listen to me. I had
everything arranged before this girl and her friend interfered. Madame
Lamia was preparing a perfect android copy of the Princess for you to
marry. You would have been married with full ceremony, and after your
unfortunate death at her hands, she would have married me. Now Madame
Lamia is dead and the android can never be completed. So, we need
another bride. <br>
ROMANA: Well, if you think you can persuade me to marry anybody, you're
wrong. <br>
GRENDEL: Oh, but I do. I'm sure you will. Because if you refuse, the
Princess will die. Very slowly. Now what have you to say? Good. I
thought you'd see reason. I shall return shortly. Be ready. </font></p>

moonlight. An owl hoots nearby. The Doctor and K9 are in a small boat.)
<br>
DOCTOR: All right, K9, let's go. <br>
ZADEK: The old watergate should be right under the far wall. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
ZADEK: I'm afraid the door must be a foot thick. The timbers were
intended to withstand any battering ram. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry. <br>
ZADEK: But <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, we'll manage. You just make sure you're all ready
to charge in the moment those gates are open. <br>

KURSTER: My lord. <br>

At the first sign of trouble, get down to the dungeons and deal with
the Princess. You understand me? <br>
KURSTER: I do, my lord. <br>
GRENDEL: I shall deal with the King myself. <br>
KURSTER: I shall be nearby if you need help. <br>

something I always enjoy, it's a good wedding, isn't that true, Romana?
(to the Archimandrite) Now, listen. Have you got to the bit where you
ask them if there's any just cause why they shouldn't be joined in <br>

GRENDEL: I shall give you a fencing lesson before you die. <br>

sparks. Grendel takes the en garde position and the Doctor copies him
exactly, turning his back to his opponent.) <br>
GRENDEL: En garde! <br>
(Grendel hits the Doctor in the back. The Doctor turns and the fight
begins. Grendel makes the attacks and the Doctor parries or dodges at
first, then they get into a series of attacks and ripostes.) <br>
GRENDEL: You improve, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor does a series of feints which leaves his tip near Grendel's
throat. Kurster watches from the doorway. The Doctor doesn't follow
through, so they start again. Finally, the Doctor knocks the sword from
Grendel's hand. After briefly having him at his mercy, he kicks the
sword back to its owner. He turns his back and still parries Grendel's
attack. Kurster leaves now, and Romana follows. Till tries to join in
the fight, but Reynart stops him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gate control. <br>
REYNART: Where is it? <br>
