GIRL: Yes. <br>

DOCTOR: The Library. So big it doesn't need a name. Just a great big
The. <br>
DONNA: It's like a city. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a world. Literally, a world. The whole core of the planet
is the index computer. Biggest hard drive ever. And up here, every book
ever written. Whole continents of Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones, Monty
Python's Big Red Book. Brand new editions, specially printed. <br>
(They look over a balcony onto roofs below.) <br>
DOCTOR: We're near the equator, so this must be biographies. I love
biographies. <br>
DONNA: Yeah, very you. Always a death at the end. <br>
DOCTOR: You need a good death. Without death, there'd only be comedies.
Dying gives us size. <br>
(Donna picks up a book and the Doctor takes it from her.) <br>
DOCTOR: Way-a. Spoilers. <br>
DONNA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: These books are from your future. You don't want to read ahead.
Spoil all the surprises. Like peeking at the end. <br>
DONNA: Isn't travelling with you one big spoiler? <br>
DOCTOR: I try to keep you away from major plot developments. Which, to
be honest, I seem to be very bad at, because you know what? This is the
biggest library in the universe. So where is everyone? It's silent. <br>
(The Doctor uses his screwdriver on a nearby information screen,
bringing it online.) <br>
DONNA: The library? <br>
DOCTOR: The planet. The whole planet. <br>
DONNA: Maybe it's a Sunday. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I never land on Sundays. Sundays are boring. <br>
DONNA: Well, maybe everyone's really, really quiet. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, maybe. But they'd still show up on the system. <br>
DONNA: Doctor, why are we here? Really, why? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you know, just passing. <br>
DONNA: No, seriously. It was all let's hit the beach, then suddenly
we're in a library. Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's interesting. <br>
DONNA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Scanning for life forms. If I do a scan looking for your basic
humanoids. You know, your book readers, few limbs and a face, apart
from us, I get nothing. Zippo, nada. See? Nobody home. But if I widen
the parameters to any kind of life. <br>
(The screen says Error 1,000,000,000,000 lifeform number capped at
maximum record.) <br>
DOCTOR: A million, million. Gives up after that. A million, million. <br>
DONNA: But there's nothing here. There's no one. <br>
DOCTOR: And not a sound. A million. million life forms, and silence in
the library. <br>
DONNA: But there's no one here. There's just books. I mean, it's not
the books, is it? I mean, it can't be the books, can it? I mean, books
can't be alive. <br>
(They both reach slowly for a book. A voice makes them jump.) <br>
NODE [OC]: Welcome. <br>

humanoid sculpture by a curved desk turns its head and speaks with a
female voice from a small face on its surface.) <br>
NODE: I am Courtesy Node seven one zero slash aqua. Please enjoy the
Library and respect the personal access codes of all your fellow
readers, regardless of species or hygiene taboo. <br>
DONNA: That face, it looks real. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, don't worry about it. <br>
DONNA: A statue with a real face, though? It's a hologram or something,
isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: No, but really, it's fine. <br>
NODE: Additional. There follows a brief message from the Head Librarian
for your urgent attention. It has been edited for tone and content by a
Felman Lux Automated Decency Filter. Message follows. Run. For God's
sake, run. No way is safe. The library has sealed itself, we can't. Oh,
they're here. Argh. Slarg. Snick. Message ends. Please switch off your
mobile comm. units for the comfort of other readers. <br>
DOCTOR: So that's why we're here. Any other messages, same date stamp? <br>
NODE: One additional message. This message carries a Felman Lux
coherency warning of five zero eleven <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, fine, fine, fine. Just play it. <br>
NODE: Message follows. Count the shadows. For God's sake, remember, if
you want to live, count the shadows. Message ends. <br>
DOCTOR: Donna? <br>
DONNA: Yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: Stay out of the shadows. <br>

DOCTOR: Yeah, I kind of, sort of lied a bit. I got a message on the

DOCTOR: What do you think? Cry for help? <br>
DONNA: Cry for help with a kiss? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we've all done that. <br>
DONNA: Who's it from? <br>
DOCTOR: No idea. <br>
DONNA: So why did we come here? Why did you <br>
DOCTOR: Donna. <br>

DONNA: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: Run! <br>
(They can't get the nearest door open.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
DONNA: What, is it locked? <br>
DOCTOR: Jammed. The wood's warped. <br>
DONNA: Well, sonic it. Use the thingy. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't, it's wood. <br>
DONNA: What, it doesn't do wood? <br>
DOCTOR: Hang on, hang on. I can vibrate the molecules, fry the
bindings. I can shatterline the interface. <br>

of surprise. What was that? What was after us? I mean, did we just run
away from a power cut? <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly. <br>
DONNA: Are we safe here? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course we're safe. There's a little shop. <br>

occasion of his death. <br>
DONNA: It's a real face?. <br>
MARK NODE: It has been actualised individually for you from the many
facial aspects saved to our extensive flesh banks. Please enjoy. <br>

real dead person's face on it. <br>

of stuff. I need a bigger head. <br>

DOCTOR: It's not dark. <br>

DOCTOR: We need to get back to the Tardis. <br>

DOCTOR: Because that shadow hasn't gone. It's moved. <br>

DOCTOR: Get out. <br>
DONNA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: All of you. Turn around, get back in your rocket and fly away.

believe you. <br>

ANITA: How do you know they're not androids? <br>
RIVER: Because I've dated androids. They're rubbish. <br>

exclusives. <br>
RIVER: I lied, I'm always lying. Bound to be others. <br>
LUX: Miss Evangelista, I want to see the contracts. <br>
RIVER: You came through the north door, yeah? How was that, much
damage? <br>
DOCTOR: Please, just leave. I'm asking you seriously and properly, just
leave. Hang on. Did you say expedition? <br>
LUX: My expedition. I funded it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you're not, are you? Tell me you're not archaeologists. <br>
RIVER: Got a problem with archaeologists? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm a time traveller. I point and laugh at archaeologists. <br>
RIVER: Ah. Professor River Song, archaeologist. <br>
DOCTOR: River Song, lovely name. As you're leaving, and you're leaving
now, you need to set up a quarantine beacon. Code wall the planet, the
whole planet. Nobody comes here, not ever again. Not one living thing,
not here, not ever. Stop right there. What's your name? <br>
ANITA: Anita. <br>
DOCTOR: Anita, stay out of the shadows. Not a foot, not a finger in the
shadows till you're safely back in your ship. Goes for all of you. Stay
in the light. Find a nice, bright spot and just stand. If you
understand me, look very, very scared. No, bit more scared than that.
Okay, do for now. You. Who are you? <br>

DOCTOR: Okay, Dave. <br>
OTHER DAVE: Oh, well, Other Dave, because that's Proper Dave the pilot,
he was the first Dave, so when we <br>

OTHER DAVE: Yeah. Oh, it's a bit darker. <br>
DOCTOR: How much darker? <br>
OTHER DAVE Oh, like I could see where we came through just like a
moment ago. I can't now. <br>
DOCTOR: Seal up this door. We'll find another way out. <br>
OTHER DAVE: Would you <br>
LUX: We're not looking for a way out. Miss Evangelista? <br>
EVANGELISTA: I'm Mister Lux's personal everything. You need to sign
these contracts agreeing that your individual experience inside the
library are the intellectual property of the Felman Lux Corporation. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, give it here. <br>
DONNA: Yeah, lovely. Thanks. <br>
(The Doctor and Donna tear up the contracts.) <br>
LUX: My family built this library. I have rights. <br>
RIVER: You have a mouth that won't stop. You think there's danger here?
<br>
DOCTOR: Something came to this library and killed everything in it.
Killed a whole world. Danger? Could be. <br>
RIVER: That was a hundred years ago. The Library's been silent for a
hundred years. Whatever came here's long dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Bet your life? <br>
RIVER: Always. <br>
LUX: What are you doing? <br>
OTHER DAVE: He said seal the door. <br>
DOCTOR: Torch. <br>
LUX: You're taking orders from him? <br>
DOCTOR: Spooky, isn't it? <br>
(The Doctor takes Lux's torch and shines it into the far recesses of
the round room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Almost every species in the universe has an irrational fear of
the dark. But they're wrong, because it's not irrational. It's Vashta
Nerada. <br>
DONNA: What's Vashta Nerada? <br>
DOCTOR: It's what's in the dark. It's what's always in the dark.
Lights! That's what we need, lights. You got lights? <br>
RIVER: What for? <br>
DOCTOR: Form a circle. Safe area. Big as you can, lights pointing out. <br>
RIVER: Oi. Do as he says. <br>
LUX: You're not listening to this man? <br>
RIVER: Apparently I am. Anita, unpack the lights. Other Dave, make sure
the door's secure, then help Anita. Mister Lux, put your helmet back
on, block the visor. Proper Dave, find an active terminal. I want you
to access the library database. See what you can find about what
happened here a hundred years ago. Pretty boy, you're with me. Step
into my office. <br>
LUX: Professor Song, why am I the only one wearing my helmet? <br>
RIVER: I don't fancy you. <br>
(The Doctor goes over to Dave at the terminal. Lux takes off his
helmet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Probably I can help you. <br>
RIVER: Pretty boy. With me, I said. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm pretty boy? <br>
DONNA: Yes. Ooo, that came out a bit quick. <br>
DOCTOR: Pretty? <br>
DONNA: Meh. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't let your shadows cross. Seriously, don't even let them
touch. Any of them could be infected. <br>
OTHER DAVE: How can a shadow be infected? <br>
EVANGELISTA: Excuse me, can I help? <br>
ANITA: No, we're fine. <br>
EVANGELISTA: I could just you know, hold things. <br>
OTHER DAVE: No, really, we're okay. <br>
DONNA: Couldn't she help? <br>
OTHER DAVE: Trust me. I just spent four days on a ship with that woman.
She's er <br>
ANITA: Couldn't tell the difference between the escape pod and the
bathroom. We had to go back for her. Twice. <br>
(Evangelista talks with her boss. River takes a battered book from her
backpack. Its cover is blue with eight squares. <br>
RIVER: Thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: For what? <br>
RIVER: The usual. For coming when I call. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that was you? <br>
RIVER: You're doing a very good job, acting like you don't know me. I'm
assuming there's a reason. <br>
DOCTOR: A fairly good one, actually. <br>
RIVER: Okay, shall we do diaries, then? Where are we this time? Er,
going by your face, I'd say it's early days for you, yeah? So, er,
crash of the Byzantium. Have we done that yet? Obviously ringing no
bells. Right. Oh, picnic at Asgard. Have we done Asgard yet? Obviously
not. Blimey, very early days, then. Whoo, life with a time traveller.
Never knew it could be such hard work. Look at you. Oh, you're young. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm really not, you know. <br>
RIVER: No, but you are. Your eyes. You're younger than I've ever seen
you. <br>
DOCTOR: You've seen me before, then? <br>
RIVER: Doctor, please tell me you know who I am. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? <br>

protocols. I seem to have set something off. What is that? Is that an

LUX: I'm protecting my family's pride. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, funny thing, Mister Lux. I don't want to see everyone in
this room dead because some idiot thinks his pride is more important. <br>
RIVER: Then why don't you sign his contract? I didn't either. I'm
getting worse than you. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, okay. Let's start at the beginning. What happened
here? On the actual day, a hundred years ago, what physically happened?
<br>
(The girl presses a button on her remote, and a panel slides up in the
wall. Evangelista notices it.) <br>
RIVER: There was a message from the Library. Just one. The lights are
going out. Then the computer sealed the planet, and there was nothing
for a hundred years. <br>
LUX: It's taken three generations of my family just to decode the seals
and get back in. <br>
EVANGELISTA: Er, excuse me? <br>
LUX: Not just now. <br>
RIVER: There was one other thing in the last message. <br>
LUX: That's confidential. <br>
RIVER: I trust this man with my life, with everything. <br>
LUX: You've only just met him. <br>
RIVER: No, he's only just met me. <br>
EVANGELISTA: Er, this might be important, actually. <br>
LUX: In a moment. <br>
RIVER: This is a data extract that came with the message. <br>
DOCTOR: Four thousand and twenty two saved. No survivors. <br>
RIVER: Four thousand and twenty two. That's the exact number of people
who were in the library when the planet was sealed. <br>
DONNA: But how can four thousand and twenty two people have been saved
if there were no survivors? <br>
RIVER: That's what we're here to find out. <br>
LUX: And so far, what we haven't found are any bodies. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lecture hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Evangelista explores the open panel alone. She
goes down a short passage to what might be a reading room or lecture
hall. Anyway, every flat surface has books piled on it. She steps into
the darkness and screams. The Doctor leads the way to investigate. They
find a skeleton in rags.) <br>
DOCTOR: Everybody, careful. Stay in the light. <br>
DAVE: You keep saying that. I don't see the point. <br>
DOCTOR: Who screamed? <br>
DAVE: Miss Evangelista. <br>
DOCTOR: Where is she? <br>
RIVER: Miss Evangelista, please state your current <br>
(River's voice echoes from very nearby.) <br>
RIVER: Please state your current position. <br>
(River takes a lit comm. unit from the remains of the skeleton's
collar.)<br>
RIVER: It's her. It's Miss Evangelista. <br>
ANITA: We heard her scream a few seconds ago. What could do that to a
person in a few seconds? <br>
DOCTOR: It took a lot less than a few seconds. <br>
ANITA: What did? <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Hello? <br>
RIVER: Er, I'm sorry, everyone. Er, this isn't going to be pleasant.
She's ghosting. <br>
DONNA: She's what? <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Hello? Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hello? Excuse me. <br>
DONNA: That's, that's her, that's Miss Evangelista. <br>
DAVE: I don't want to sound horrible, but couldn't we just, you know? <br>
RIVER: This is her last moment. No, we can't. A little respect, thank
you. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Sorry, where am I? Excuse me? <br>
DONNA: But that's Miss Evangelista. <br>
RIVER: It's a data ghost. She'll be gone in a moment. Miss Evangelista,
you're fine. Just relax. We'll be with you presently. <br>
DONNA: What's a data ghost? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a neural relay in the communicator. Lets you send
thought mail. That's it there. Those green lights. Sometimes it can
hold an impression of a living consciousness for a short time after
death. Like an afterimage. <br>
ANITA: My grandfather lasted a day. Kept talking about his shoelaces. <br>
DONNA: She's in there. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: I can't see. I can't. Where am I? <br>
DAVE: She's just brain waves now. The pattern won't hold for long. <br>
DONNA: But, she's conscious. She's thinking. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: I can't see, I can't. I don't know what I'm thinking.
<br>
DOCTOR: She's a footprint on the beach. And the tide's coming in. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Where's that woman? The nice woman. Is she there? <br>
LUX: What woman? <br>
DONNA: She means. I think she means me. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Is she there? The nice woman. <br>
RIVER: Yes, she's here. Hang on. Go ahead. She can hear you. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Hello? Are you there? <br>
DOCTOR: Help her. <br>
DONNA: She's dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Help her. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Hello? Is that the nice woman? <br>
DONNA: Yeah. Hello. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm here. You okay? <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: What I said before, about being stupid. Don't tell
the others, they'll only laugh. <br>
DONNA: Course I won't. Course I won't tell them. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Don't tell the others, they'll only laugh. <br>
DONNA: I won't tell them. I said I won't. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Don't tell the others, they'll only laugh. <br>
DONNA: I'm not going to tell them. <br>
(The green light starts blinking.) <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Don't tell the others, they'll only laugh. <br>
RIVER: She's looping now. The pattern's degrading. <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: I can't think. I don't know, I, I, I, I scream. Ice
cream. Ice cream. Ice cream. Ice cream. <br>
RIVER: Does anybody mind if I? <br>
EVANGELISTA [OC]: Ice cream. Ice cream.<br>
(River turns off the comm. unit.) <br>
DONNA: That was, that was horrible. That was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen. <br>
RIVER: No. It's just a freak of technology. But whatever did this to
her, whatever killed her, I'd like a word with that. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll introduce you. </font></p>

FATHER: Darling, Doctor Moon is going now, but he'd like a word with
you alone. Is that all right? <br>
GIRL: Yes, of course, Doctor Moon. <br>
MOON: Thank you. Now, listen. This is important. There's the real
world, and there's the world of nightmares. That's right, isn't it? You
understand that? <br>
GIRL: Yes, I know, Doctor Moon. <br>
MOON: What I want you to remember is this, and I know it's hard. The
real world is a lie, and your nightmares are real. The library is real.
There are people trapped in there, people who need to be saved. The
shadows are moving again. Those people are depending on you. Only you
can save them. Only you.

screwdriver.) <br>
RIVER: You travel with him, don't you? The Doctor, you travel with him.
<br>
DONNA: What of it? <br>
DOCTOR: Proper Dave, could you move over a bit? <br>
DAVE: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Over there by the water cooler. Thanks. <br>
DONNA: You know him, don't you? <br>
RIVER: Oh God, do I know that man. We go way back, that man and me.
Just not this far back. <br>
DONNA: I'm sorry, what? <br>
RIVER: He hasn't met me yet. I sent him a message, but it went wrong.
It arrived too early. This is the Doctor in the days before he knew me.
And he looks at me, he looks right through me and it shouldn't kill me,
but it does. <br>
DONNA: What are you talking about? Are you just talking rubbish? Do you
know him or don't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Donna! Quiet, I'm working. <br>
DONNA: Sorry. <br>
RIVER: Donna. You're Donna. Donna Noble. <br>
DONNA: Yeah. Why? <br>
RIVER: I do know the Doctor, but in the future. His personal future. <br>
DONNA: So why don't you know me? Where am I in the future? <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, got a live one. That's not darkness down those tunnels.
This is not a shadow. It's a swarm. A man eating swarm. <br>
(The Doctor throws a chicken leg into the shadow. It is only bone by
the time it hits the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: The piranhas of the air. The Vashta Nerada. Literally, the
shadows that melt the flesh. Most planets have them, but usually in
small clusters. I've never seen an infestation on this scale, or this
aggressive. <br>
DONNA: What do you mean, most planets? Not Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. Earth, and a billion other worlds. Where there's meat,
there's Vashta Nerada. You can see them sometimes, if you look. The
dust in sunbeams. <br>
DONNA: If they were on Earth, we'd know. <br>
DOCTOR: Nah. Normally they live on road kill. But sometimes people go
missing. Not everyone comes back out of the dark. <br>
RIVER: Every shadow? <br>
DOCTOR: No. But any shadow. <br>
RIVER: So what do we do? <br>
DOCTOR: Daleks, aim for the eyestalk. Sontarans, back of the neck.
Vashta Nerada? Run. Just run. <br>
RIVER: Run? Run where? <br>
DOCTOR: This is an index point. There must be an exit teleport
somewhere. <br>
LUX: Don't look at me, I haven't memorised the schematics. <br>
DONNA: Doctor, the little shop. They always make you go through the
little shop on the way out so they can sell you stuff. <br>
DOCTOR: You're right. Brilliant! That's why I like the little shop. <br>
DAVE: Okay, let's move it. <br>
He heads towards the shop but the Doctor spots something. <br>
DOCTOR: Actually, Proper Dave? Could you stay where you are for a
moment? <br>
DAVE: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry. But you've got two shadows. <br>
(He has, at right angles to each other.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's how they hunt. They latch on to a food source and keep it
fresh. <br>
DAVE: What do I do? <br>
DOCTOR: You stay absolutely still, like there's a wasp in the room.
Like there's a million wasps. <br>
RIVER: We're not leaving you, Dave. <br>
DOCTOR: Course we're not leaving him. Where's your helmet? Don't point,
just tell me. <br>
DAVE: On the floor, by my bag. <br>
(Anita goes to get it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't cross his shadow. Thanks. Now, the rest of you, helmets
back on and sealed up. We'll need everything we've got. <br>
(The Doctor puts Dave's helmet on him.) <br>
DONNA: But, Doctor, we haven't got any helmets. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, but we're safe anyway. <br>
DONNA: How are we safe? <br>
DOCTOR: We're not. That was a clever lie to shut you up. Professor,
anything I can do with the suit? <br>
LUX: What good are the damn suits? Miss Evangelista was wearing her
suit. There was nothing left. <br>
RIVER: We can increase the mesh density. Dial it up four hundred
percent. Make it a tougher meal. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. <br>
(The Doctor uses his screwdriver to adjust Dave's suit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Eight hundred percent. Pass it on. <br>
RIVER: Gotcha. <br>
(River holds up a sonic screwdriver of her own.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's that? <br>
RIVER: It's a screwdriver. <br>
DOCTOR: It's sonic. <br>
RIVER: Yeah, I know. Snap. <br>

time to shop? <br>

DOCTOR: No talking, just moving. Try it. Right, stand there in the
middle. It's a teleport. Stand in the middle. Can't send the others,
Tardis won't recognise them. <br>
DONNA: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: You don't have a suit. You're not safe. <br>
DONNA: You don't have a suit, so you're in just as much danger as I am
and I'm not leaving you <br>

then flickers, screams, and vanishes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Where did it go? <br>
DAVE: It's just gone. I looked round, one shadow, see. <br>
RIVER: Does that mean we can leave? I don't want to hang around here. <br>
LUX: I don't know why we're still here. We can leave him, can't we? I
mean, no offence. <br>
RIVER: Shut up, Mister Lux. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you feel anything, like an energy transfer? Anything at
all? <br>
DAVE: No, no, but look, it's gone. <br>

DOCTOR: Stop there. Stop, stop, stop there. Stop moving. They're never
just gone and they never give up. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, this one's benign. <br>

here? <br>

DOCTOR: Back from it! Get back. Right back. <br>
