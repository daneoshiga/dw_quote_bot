tells me we're in the 1920's. A showgirl in skimpy red costume with
wings and feathers is hurrying along.) <br>

STAGE MANAGER [OC]: Two minutes to curtain up! <br>
MYRNA: Where's Tallulah? <br>
LOIS: Where do you think? <br>
(She knocks on the star's dressing room door.) <br>
LOIS: Hey, Tallulah, leave him alone! <br>

three juggling balls.)

She is kissing her boyfriend.) <br>
TALLULAH: It's nearly showtime, Laszlo. I got to go. <br>
LASZLO: Just promise me you'll come on Sunday, okay? My mother will
kill me if she doesn't get to meet you. <br>
TALLULAH: What if she doesn't like me? <br>
LASZLO: Tallulah, she'll love you just as much as I do. <br>
TALLULAH: Oh, you say the sweetest things. <br>
LASZLO: It's true. Now, promise me, Sunday you'll come. <br>
TALLULAH: I promise. Cross my heart. <br>
LASZLO: Oh, here. Take this, sweetheart. <br>

LASZLO: Wear it on stage and think of me. <br>
LOIS [OC]: Tallulah! <br>
TALLULAH: I'm coming! Quit yelling! How do I look? <br>
LASZLO: Like an angel. <br>
(Tallulah blows one last kiss before heading up the stairs to the
stage, where the audience are already whistling and cheering.) <br>

MARTHA: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, smell that Atlantic breeze. Nice and cold. Lovely. Martha,
have you met my friend? <br>
(She turns around and looks up. Background music is Rhapsody in Blue.) <br>
MARTHA: Is that? Oh, my God. That's the Statue of Liberty. <br>
DOCTOR: Gateway to the New World. Give me you tired, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to breath free. <br>
MARTHA: That's so brilliant. I've always wanted to go to New York. I
mean the real New York, not the new, new, new, new, new one. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's the genuine article. So good, they named it
twice. Mind you, it was New Amsterdam originally. Harder to say twice.
Now wonder it didn't catch on. New Amsterdam, New Amsterdam. <br>
MARTHA: I wonder what year it is, because look, the Empire State
Building's not even finished yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Work in progress. Still got a couple floors to go, and if I
know my history, that makes the date somewhere around <br>
(Martha picks up a copy of the New York Record which is lying on a
bench.) <br>
MARTHA: November first 1930. <br>
DOCTOR: You're getting good at this. <br>
MARTHA: Eighty years ago. It's funny, because you see all those old
newsreels all in black and white like it's so far away, but here we
are. It's real. It's now. Come on then, you. Where do you want to go
first? <br>
DOCTOR: I think our detour just got longer. <br>
MARTHA: (reads) Hooverville Mystery Deepens. What's Hooverville?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Music changes to Putting on the Ritz.) <br>
DOCTOR: Herbert Hoover, thirty first President of the USA, came to
power a year ago. Up till then New York was a boom town, the Roaring
Twenties, and then. <br>
MARTHA: The Wall Street Crash, yeah? When was that, 1929? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Whole economy wiped out overnight. Thousands of people
unemployed. All of a sudden, the huddled masses doubled in number with
nowhere to go. So, they ended up here in Central Park. <br>
MARTHA: What, they actually live in the park? In the middle of the
city?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A shanty town overlooked by Manhattan
skyscrapers.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ordinary people lost their jobs. Couldn't pay the rent and they
lost everything. There are places like this all over America. No one's
helping them. You only come to Hooverville when there's nowhere else to
go. <br>
BLACK MAN: You thieving lowlife! <br>
(A fight breaks out.) <br>
BLACK MAN: (unintelligible) for a single loaf! <br>
WHITE MAN: I didn't touch it! <br>
BLACK MAN: Somebody stole it.! <br>
(A black man comes out of a tent.) <br>
SOLOMON: Cut that out! Cut that out right now! <br>
(He breaks up the fight.) <br>
BLACK MAN: He stole my bread! <br>
SOLOMON: That's enough! Did you take it? <br>
WHITE MAN: I don't know what happened. He just went crazy. <br>
SOLOMON: That's enough! Now, think real careful before you lie to me. <br>
WHITE MAN: I'm starving, Solomon. <br>
(Soloman holds out his hand, and the white man takes the bread out from
inside his coat.) <br>
SOLOMON: We all starving. We all got families somewhere. <br>
(He does the judgment of Soloman and gives each man half of the loaf.) <br>
SOLOMAN: No stealing and no fighting. You know the rules. Thirteen
years ago I fought in the Great War. A lot of us did. And the only
reason we got through was because we stuck together. No matter how bad
things get, we still act like human beings. It's all we got. <br>
(The two fighters walk away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. (to Solomon) I suppose that makes you the boss around
here. <br>
SOLOMON: And, er, who might you be? <br>
MARTHA: He's the Doctor. I'm Martha. <br>
SOLOMON: A doctor. Huh. Well, we got stockbrokers, we got a lawyer, but
you're the first doctor. Neighbourhood gets classier by the day. <br>
MARTHA: How many people live here? <br>
SOLOMON: At any one time, hundreds. No place else to go. But I will say
this about Hooverville. We are a truly equal society. Black, white, all
the same. All starving. So you're welcome, both of you. But tell me.
Doctor, you're a man of learning, right? Explain this to me. That
there's going to be the tallest building in the world. How come they
can do that, when we got people starving in the heart of Manhattan?

on, men are standing on the scaffolding and pulling up buckets.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Inside the structure, a man is sitting at a desk
looking at blueprints while the foreman paces.) <br>
FOREMAN: I'm telling you, the men won't stand for it. I mean, are you
out of your mind? I got five hundred men working seven days a week.
They're flat out, and you want us to go faster? <br>
DIAGORAS: The new masters demand it, <br>
FOREMAN: But we're on schedule. What's the problem? Another month and
we'll be done. <br>
DIAGORAS: The mast on this building needs extra work completed by
tonight. <br>
FOREMAN: Tonight? No way. It's impossible. <br>
DIAGORAS: That's an order. <br>
FOREMAN: Yeah? Well, one word from me and every man on this site stops
working. So go on. Tell your masters that. <br>
DIAGORAS: If that's your attitude, I think that you should tell them
yourself. <br>
FOREMAN: Yeah? Well, I ain't afraid of no man in a suit. <br>
(Diagoras summons the lift.) <br>
FOREMAN: These er, these new bosses? What's their names? <br>
DIAGORAS: I think you could say they're from out of town. <br>
FOREMAN: Italians? <br>
DIAGORAS: A bit further than that. <br>
FOREMAN: How much further? <br>
DIAGORAS: Beyond your imagination. <br>
FOREMAN: What's that supposed to mean? Who are they? Mister Diagoras,
who're we working for? <br>
(The lift comes up from the bottom to floor 100.) <br>
DIAGORAS: Behold your masters. <br>
(The lift doors open to reveal one of the Cult of Skaro Dalek number 3
with by two pigmen.) <br>
FOREMAN: What the hell? <br>
DALEK 3: I have been summoned. Explain. Explain. <br>
FOREMAN: It can talk. How does it talk? And what the hell are they? You
got to be kidding me. <br>
DIAGORAS: I'm sorry, my lord, but this man is refusing to complete the
work. <br>
DALEK 3: Then we must replace him. <br>
FOREMAN: Is anybody going to tell me what the hell is happening here? <br>
DALEK 3: Use him. Take him for the Final Experiment. <br>
(The pigmen take hold of the foreman and bundle him into the lift.) <br>
FOREMAN: Hey, what's going on? Let go! Let go of me! Get off me, you
freaks! Mister Diagoras, will you tell
them? <br>
(The lift goes back down.) <br>
DALEK 3: The Empire State Building must be completed in time. <br>
DIAGORAS: It will be. Trust me. Labour is cheap and that man can be
replaced. <br>
DALEK 3: The plan must not fail. We calculate the gamma strike has
accelerated. We need more bodies immediately. <br>
DIAGORAS: Yes, Master.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: So, men are going missing. Is this true? <br>
SOLOMON: It's true all right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Solomon's tent]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: But what does missing mean? Men must come
and go here all the time. It's not like anyone's keeping a register. <br>
SOLOMON: Come on in. This is different. <br>
MARTHA: In what way? <br>
SOLOMON: Someone takes them, at night. We hear something, someone calls
out for help. By the time we get there, they're gone like they vanished
into thin air. <br>
DOCTOR: And you're sure someone's taking them? <br>
SOLOMON: Doctor, when you got next to nothing, you hold on to the
little you got. Your knife, blanket, you take it with you. You don't
leave bread uneaten, fire still burning. <br>
MARTHA: Have you been to the police? <br>
SOLOMON: Yeah, we tried that. Another deadbeat goes missing, big deal. <br>
DOCTOR: So the question is, who's taking them and what for? <br>
FRANK [OC]: Solomon! <br>
FRANK: Solomon, Mister Diagoras is here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Hooverville]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DIAGORAS: I need men. Volunteers. I've got a little
work for you and you sure look like you can use the money. <br>
FRANK: Yeah. What is the money? <br>
DIAGORAS: A dollar a day. <br>
SOLOMON: What's the work? <br>
DIAGORAS: A little trip down the sewers. Got a tunnel collapsed needs
clearing and fixing. Any takers? <br>
SOLOMON: A dollar a day? That's slave wage. And men don't always come
back up, do they. <br>
DIAGORAS: Accidents happen. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? What sort of accidents? <br>
DIAGORAS: You don't need the work? That's fine. Anybody else? <br>
(The Doctor raises his hand.) <br>
DIAGORAS: Enough with the questions. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no. I'm volunteering. I'll go. <br>
(Martha raises her hand.) <br>
MARTHA: I'll kill you for this. <br>
DIAGORAS: Anybody else? <br>
(Frank and Solomon.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DIAGORAS: Turn left. Go about a half a mile. Follow
tunnel two seven three. Fall's right ahead of you, you can't miss it. <br>
FRANK: And when do we get our dollar? <br>
DIAGORAS: When you come back up. <br>
DOCTOR: And if we don't come back up? <br>
DIAGORAS: Then I got no one to pay. <br>
SOLOMON: Don't worry, we'll be back. <br>
MARTHA: Let's hope so. <br>
(The Doctor stares into Diagoras' eyes for a few moments, then follows
the others.) <br>
FRANK: We just got to stick together. It's easy to get lost. It's like
a huge rabbit warren. You could hide an army down here. <br>
MARTHA: So what about you, Frank? You're not from around these parts,
are you? <br>
FRANK: Oh, you could talk. No, I'm Tennessee born and bred. <br>
MARTHA: So how come you're here? <br>
FRANK: Oh, my daddy died. Mama couldn't afford to feed us all. So, I'm
the oldest, up to me to feed myself. So I put on my coat, hitched up
here on the railroads. There's a whole lot of runaways in the camp,
younger than me, from all over. Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas. Solomon
keeps a lookout for us. So, what about you? You're a long way from
home. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah, I'm just a hitcher too. <br>
FRANK: You stick with me, you'll be all right. <br>
DOCTOR: So this Diagoras bloke, who is he then? <br>
SOLOMON: A couple of months ago, he was just another foreman. Now, it
seems like he's running most of Manhattan. <br>
DOCTOR: How'd he manage that then? <br>
SOLOMON: These are strange times. A man can go from being King of the
Hill to the lowest of the low overnight. It's just for some folks it
works the other way round. <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa! <br>
(A luminous green jellyfish is lying on the ground in front of them.) <br>
MARTHA: Is it radioactive or something? It's gone off, whatever it is.
And you've got to pick it up. <br>
DOCTOR: Shine your torch through it. Composite organic matter. Martha?
Medical opinion? <br>
MARTHA: It's not human. I know that. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's not. And I'll tell you something else. We must be at
least half a mile in. I don't see any sign of a collapse, do you? So
why did Mister Diagoras send up down here? <br>
MARTHA: Where are we now? What's above us? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we're right underneath Manhattan.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DIAGORAS: And here, the crowning glory of the
Empire State Building, the mast itself. One thousand four hundred and
seventy two feet above New York. <br>
FOREMAN 2: It's a beautiful thing, sir, and every single one of us is
proud of it. My wife says it's like a, like a spire reaching into
Heaven. <br>
DIAGORAS: Except the Gates of Heaven need a little decoration. These
plates have got to be fixed to the mast, right to the base itself. <br>
(Three plates with a familiar row of four domes on them.) <br>
FOREMAN 2: That's okay. It's not too bad. Shouldn't take too long. <br>
DIAGORAS: But the work has got to be finished tonight. <br>
(The five men protest.) <br>
FOREMAN 2: What, are you trying to kill us? We're flat out up here!
Come on. <br>
DIAGORAS: Don't argue with me! <br>
FOREMAN 2: But sir, men can't work up there at night. It's freezing.
Your hands go numb. You lose your grip, you fall. <br>
DIAGORAS: You don't get it. If you won't work I can replace you like
that! Now take those panels and get going. <br>
(A man picks up a panel. It is very heavy.) <br>
MAN: What sort of metal is this anyway? <br>
DIAGORAS: Don't ask questions, just go. <br>
(They take the panels leave.) <br>
DIAGORAS: And I don't care how cold it is, how tired you are. Just get
out there and finish the job! <br>
(A few moments later, a Dalek enters from the lift.) <br>
DALEK 3: The conductor must be complete for our plan to succeed. <br>
DIAGORAS: Unemployment is such an incentive. It'll get done, don't
worry. <br>
DALEK 3: Daleks have no concept of worry. <br>
DIAGORAS: Yeah? Well, lucky you. <br>
DALEK 3: This day is ending. Humankind is weak. You shelter from the
dark. And yet, you have built all this. <br>
DIAGORAS: That's progress. You got to move with the times or you get
left behind. <br>
DALEK 3: My planet is gone, destroyed in a great war, yet versions of
this city stand throughout history. The human race always continues. <br>
DIAGORAS: We've had wars. I've been a soldier myself, and I swore then
I'd survive, no matter what. <br>
DALEK 3: You have rare ambition. <br>
DIAGORAS: I want to run this city, whatever it takes, by any means
necessary. <br>
DALEK 3: You think like a Dalek. <br>
DIAGORAS: I'll take that as a compliment.

first made contact with me, transmitting your thoughts into the corners

lost. <br>

got a point, though, my mate Frank. I'd hate to be stuck down here on
my own. We know the way out. Daylight. If you come with us <br>

disappeared two weeks ago. No letter, no goodbye, no nothing. And I'm
not stupid. I know some guys are just pigs but not my Laszlo. I mean,
what kind of guy asks you to meet his mother before he vamooses? <br>

TALLULAH: I wish I knew. One minute he's there, the next, zip.

TALLULAH: Tallulah. <br>
DOCTOR: Tallulah. <br>
TALLULAH: Three Ls and an H. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. We can try to find Laszlo, but he's not the only one.
There are people disappearing every night. <br>
SOLOMON: And there are creatures. Such creatures. <br>
TALLULAH: What do you mean, creatures? <br>
DOCTOR: Look, listen, just trust me. Everyone is in danger. I need to
find out exactly what this is. <br>

crude little DNA scan for this beastie. If I can get a chromosomal

SOLOMON: How about you, Doctor? Where are you from? I've been all over.
I never heard anybody talk like you. Just exactly who are you? <br>

(Solomon goes to the NYC sewer entrance.) <br>
SOLOMON: I was so scared, Doctor. I let them take Frank because I was
just so scared. I got to get back to Hooverville. With these creatures
on the loose, we got to protect ourselves. Ain't no one else
going to help us. <br>

was a lady. He'd leave a flower for me on my dressing table. Every day,
just a single rose bud. <br>
MARTHA: Haven't you reported him missing? <br>
TALLULAH: Sure. He's just a stagehand. Who cares? The management

TALLULAH: Okay, so then they fire me. <br>
MARTHA: But they'd listen to you. You're one of the stars. <br>

only because Heidi Chicane broke her ankle. Which had nothing to do
with me whatever anybody says. I can't afford to make a fuss. If I

MARTHA: Okay, I get it. <br>
TALLULAH: It's the Depression, sweetie. Your heart might break, but the

come back. <br>
