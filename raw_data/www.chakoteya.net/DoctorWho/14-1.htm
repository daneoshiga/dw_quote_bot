<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SARAH: Where are we now? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis, where else? <br>
SARAH: I know we're in the Tardis, I just don't know this bit. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll give you a guided tour someday. <br>
(Sarah stops to look through an open doorway into a room which looks
like an elegant Georgian drawing room, with a pair of Wellington boots
by the door.) <br>
SARAH: What's in there? <br>
DOCTOR: Boot cupboard. Not very interesting. <br>
SARAH: Boot cupboard? It's enormous! <br>
(They keep walking.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I've seen bigger boot cupboards. <br>
SARAH: Just how big is the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, how big's big? Relative dimensions, you see. No constant.
<br>
SARAH: That's not an answer. <br>
DOCTOR: How big are you at the moment? <br>
SARAH: Five four, just, and that's still not an answer. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, listen. There are no measurements in infinity. You
humans have got such limited little minds. I don't know why I like you
so much. <br>
SARAH: Because you have such good taste. <br>
DOCTOR: That's true, that's very true. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Wooden console room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SARAH: Oh, this looks good. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
SARAH: Hey. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it is good. Do you know, this is the second control
room. You know, I could run the Tardis just as easily from here as I
could from the old one. Come to think of it, this was the old one. <br>
(He blows the dust off a frilly shirt on a suit hangar. <br>
SARAH: That looks like a shaving mirror. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. <br>
(Sarah finds a descant recorder and starts playing 'British Grenadiers'
on it. The Doctor opens the wooden shutters on the small console and
switches on the power, lighting up the wood and brass room fully. Then
he activates a viewscreen in the panelled wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha. <br>
SARAH: What? What's that? <br>
(A blue swirly thing on the viewscreen looks like it is sucking stars
into itself.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's the Mandragora Helix. I thought we'd avoided it. <br>
SARAH: Oh. What's the Mandragora Helix? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a spiral of pure energy that radiates outwards in ways no
one understands, though at its centre there's a controlling
intelligence. <br>
SARAH: Intelligence? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SARAH: We're heading straight for it. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it does seem more active than usual. Let's hope we can
counter-magnetise enough to resist the pull. <br>
SARAH: Is it living? <br>
DOCTOR: It's living, all right, but that's all anyone <br>
(Werp, jolt!) <br>
SARAH: Oh! Something has hit us, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: We'll just have to push on and hope we come out the other side.
<br>
SARAH: Oh, it's inside my head! <br>
DOCTOR: Concentrate, Sarah. <br>
SARAH: On what? <br>
DOCTOR: Anything, anything. Say the alphabet backwards. Come on. Z, Y,
X <br>
SARAH: W, U, V, T, S <br>
(The Tardis is distorted as it is sucked into the middle of the swirly
thing. It all solidifies into a series of concentric circles of
crystals, and the Tardis appears again in the middle.) <br>
SARAH: F, E, D <br>
DOCTOR: C, B, A. It's all over, it's all over. Any ill effects? <br>
SARAH: No, I don't think so. Are we there? <br>
DOCTOR: Where? <br>
SARAH: Where we're going. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. The Astrosextant rectifier has gone out of phase.
I'll just go out and have a look. Not you, me. You stay there. <br>
(The Doctor goes up a short flight of stairs that lead to the main
doors.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Helix]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has to step down onto an invisible
hard surface in the middle of the ring of giant crystals.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Bigger than my boot cupboard. <br>
ECHO: Bigger than my boot cupboard. <br>
(Sarah steps down out of the Tardis.) <br>
SARAH: I see what you mean about relative dimensions. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I thought I told you to stay inside. <br>
SARAH: What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: What noise? <br>
(Something red is approaching very quickly.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, quick! Get down. <br>
(The Doctor pulls Sarah behind the Tardis as the red projectile whizzes
past.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, let's get out of here. <br>
SARAH: What was it? <br>
DOCTOR: Helix energy. It could have been very nasty. <br>
SARAH: What do you mean, could have been very nasty? It was. My ears <br>
DOCTOR: Will you stop whittering. <br>
(The Doctor pushes Sarah back into the Tardis and they dematerialise.
Something laughs demoniacally as they go.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A group of rustics pulling a cart of hay are
waylaid by armed men on horseback. They try to scatter but the men are
killed and the hay is burned. A richly dressed noble arrives with his
bodyguard in shining armour.) <br>
FEDERICO: Leave a few alive, Captain, to tell the others how
insurrection is dealt with. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[San Martino]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The noble rides through the gateway into Clough
Williams-Ellis' Italianate masterpiece at Portmerion, Wales. Number 2's
dome is unmistakable ahead of us.) <br>
SOLDIER: Make way for Count Federico. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Duke's bed chamber]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A priest blesses the body of an old man and
leaves. Two young men approach the bedside. The older bears a
remarkable resemblance to Henry VII.) <br>
MARCO: He was a good man, Giuliano. A just and noble ruler. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683116/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Tim
Pigott-Smith</a>.) <br>
GIULIANO: Heironymous, you foretold my father's death. How? <br>
HEIRONYMOUS: Everything is foretold by the stars. I am just a humble
astrologer. I only interpret their meaning. <br>
GIULIANO: The exact day, the very hour. It's not possible. <br>
(Count Federico enters.) <br>
HEIRONYMOUS: When Mars comes into conjunction with Saturn in the
seventh layer, in the House of the Ram, and the moon is full grown,
death comes to great ones. So it is decreed. <br>
GIULIANO: I don't believe it. <br>
HEIRONYMOUS: Many do not believe it, but the decrees of fate will be
obeyed. We have no choice. <br>
(Heironymous makes a small obeisance and leaves.) <br>
GIULIANO: I'm sorry you couldn't be present at my father's deathbed,
Uncle. <br>
FEDERICO: I came as quickly as I could. There were important matters of
state to attend to. <br>
GIULIANO: I see. I'm sorry, I thought you were out enjoying some sport.
<br>
FEDERICO: There was some trouble among the peasants in the villages.
They needed a lesson. <br>
GIULIANO: Isn't that your sport, Uncle? <br>
(The death knell tolls as Federico leaves.) <br>
MARCO: You're upset now, my lord, but don't anger your uncle. Not at
this time. <br>
GIULIANO: If I don't speak the truth, Marco, who will? <br>
MARCO: You're alone now, Giuliano. Your uncle is strong and ruthless. <br>
GIULIANO: You're forgetting, Marco. I am Duke now, and I want to rule
over a land where there is no tyranny, no lies, no blind ignorance and
superstition like that old fool who preaches about the stars. We make
our own lives, Marco, not the stars. <br>
MARCO: Nevertheless, it is most remarkable. Your father was in good
health. To die so suddenly. And he did predict it, exactly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hieronymous' chamber]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The astrologer is mixing a potion.) <br>
FEDERICO: Oh, he angers me. The last obstacle between myself and the
dukedom. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Your nephew Giuliano? <br>
FEDERICO: How soon? <br>
HIERONYMOUS: You must be patient. <br>
FEDERICO: I've been patient. Now it is almost within my grasp. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Nevertheless, so many deaths in so short a time, all so
suddenly. <br>
FEDERICO: You said yourself it was written in the stars. Don't say
you're doubting your own predictions? <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Giuliano has a sharp mind. He may suspect. <br>
FEDERICO: All the more reason to act quickly. One day, two days at the
most. The poison is still ready? Well, what's wrong? <br>
HIERONYMOUS: These last few weeks, as the summer solstice approaches, I
have been feeling <br>
FEDERICO: Feeling what? <br>
HIERONYMOUS: As if my powers were growing. As if I had been chosen to
be granted visions of the future. <br>
FEDERICO: Ha! So many correct predictions have gone to your head. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: The stars will not be mocked! <br>
FEDERICO: And neither will I! Cast your horoscope, Hieronymous. The
young Duke Giuliano will die in two day's time. I will do the rest. <br>
(The demoniac laughter is here, too.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Woodland]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises without disturbing the
birdsong. The Doctor and Sarah step out into the greenery.) <br>
DOCTOR: Strange. Forced landing. <br>
SARAH: You mean you weren't in control? <br>
DOCTOR: Not that time. I didn't touch a thing. Promise. <br>
SARAH: Oh, it's very pleasant. Nice, warm. <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe that's why I stopped using the old control room. <br>
SARAH: Doctor, there's some fantastic oranges over here! <br>
DOCTOR: Helix forcefields must have distorted the coordinates. <br>
(Sarah goes to pick an orange and start eating it, then wanders off,
watched by three hooded figures. The Doctor picks up a small broken
glass jug.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've landed on Earth. Glass technology indicates Mediterranean
area. Late fifteenth century. Not a very pleasant time. Sarah? Sarah?
Sarah? <br>
(The hooded figures are slowly carrying Sarah's unconscious body away.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Stop. <br>
(They obey. One of the figures approaches the Doctor then raises his
arms. The Doctor grabs an arm and throws the man onto his back.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now put the girl down. Gently. <br>
(Sarah is lowered to the ground then the Doctor is hit over the head
with a large stone. The Tardis door opens and the red Helix energy
sneaks out into the countryside. After a while, the Doctor wakes. The
men and Sarah are gone. <br>
By a pond, a peasant is cutting and stacking reeds. The Doctor runs up
to a drystone wall and is about to call to him when the Helix energy
whirs into view. It touches down on the water, making it boil then
heads for the peasant. His scythe bursts into flames and he is thrown
backwards. Then silence. The Doctor goes over to the corpse which now
has a lot of turquoise on it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Mandragora energy. And I brought it here. It got into the
Tardis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Giuliano's chamber]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Marco is cleaning his sword when the young Duke
sighs and sits at his desk.) <br>
MARCO: What is it? <br>
GIULIANO: Well, there's this man in Florence who claims that by
arranging ground glasses in a certain order, it's possible to see the
Moon and the stars as large as your hand. <br>
MARCO: Is that a good thing? <br>
GIULIANO: Well of course it's a good thing. That way we can learn more
about them, understand their mystery. <br>
MARCO: What is there to know about the stars except how they move in
the heavens, and we've known that for hundreds of years. <br>
GIULIANO: That's the whole point, Marco. Perhaps the stars don't move
as we think they move. That's what this man in Florence is saying.
Maybe the stars don't move at all. Maybe it's we who move. <br>
(Federico enters with Hieronymous.) <br>
GIULIANO: It is customary to knock before entering a room, Uncle. <br>
FEDERICO: I'm sorry, Giuliano, but there's bad news. <br>
GIULIANO: Why? What's happened?&nbsp;<br>
FEDERICO: Tell him. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Sire, forgive me, it is not of my doing, but this morning
I was casting a horoscope <br>
GIULIANO: I've told you often enough, I don't believe in horoscopes. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: I only wish I too could not believe, but it was there too
plainly to be ignored. <br>
GIULIANO: What was there? My death? <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Please, my lord, do not take these things lightly. I beg
you not to leave the palace, take no risks of any kind. <br>
GIULIANO: I've no intention of sacrificing my life to some old
superstitious nonsense. <br>
FEDERICO: Remember your father? He too scoffed. <br>
GIULIANO: Oh, yes. I remember my father. His death remains a mystery,
but of one thing I am certain. It was nothing to do with the stars. <br>
(Federico gestures Hieronymous to leave, and he does.) <br>
GIULIANO: How are the troubles with the peasants, Uncle? <br>
FEDERICO: We think they are being stirred by spies sent by our enemies,
but we shall catch them and make them pay for it. <br>
(Federico makes a deep bow and leaves.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Woodland path]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor comes across three men and two women
sitting by the path, muttering.) <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. I'm a traveller around here. I'm a stranger in these
parts, and I was wondering if you'd seen a girl. She'd be about <br>
(A group of four horsemen come round the corner and the peasants flee.)
<br>
DOCTOR: She's a friend of mine. She'd be about five foot four and a
half. <br>
ROSSINI: (Federico's Captain) Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm a traveller. <br>
ROSSINI: From where? <br>
DOCTOR: Have you seen a young girl, about five foot <br>
ROSSINI: Silence! <br>
DOCTOR: Probably with orange juice on her chin. <br>
(Rossini draws his sword and the Doctor shuts up.) <br>
ROSSINI: Your life is in peril. Produce your documents. <br>
(The Doctor puts his orange on the sword tip while he searches his
pockets. He produces a football fan's rattle and gives it a whirl. The
horses don't like it. He grabs one's reins and tips off its rider, then
mounts and rides off.) <br>
ROSSINI: After him! Don't let him go! <br>
(The chase is brief. The locals surround the Doctor and knock him off
the horse.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Stone pillars and an altar raised up on three
steps. Sarah is brought in blindfolded.) <br>
SARAH: Come on, this is ridiculous! Where are you taking me? Who are
you? Say something? <br>
(A man seated at above head height stands.) <br>
PRIEST: Release her. <br>
(Sarah pulls off the blindfold herself.) <br>
PRIEST: Where was she found? <br>
MONK: On the slopes of the hill of sorrows. <br>
PRIEST: At what hour? <br>
MONK: At the noon hour. <br>
PRIEST: Exactly as it was foretold. A maiden fair of face and sturdy of
body. <br>
SARAH: You can forget the flattery. What do you lot want? <br>
PRIEST: It is written that some are conscious of the purpose for which
they are chosen. Others are as innocent lambs. <br>
SARAH: Sorry? <br>
PRIEST: My child, the purity of your sacrifice renders it doubly
welcome to the mighty Demnos, god of the twin realms of moontide and
solstice. <br>
SARAH: Sacrifice? Now just a minute. <br>
PRIEST: Let her be prepared to receive the sacred blade. <br>
(Sarah is dragged away.) </font></p>

his courtiers. Rossini and his men bring in the Doctor.) <br>
ROSSINI: This is the man, sire. <br>
FEDERICO: I hear you led my ruffians quite a dance. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just a short gallop. It's good for the liver. <br>
FEDERICO: What is your name? <br>
DOCTOR: Huh? Er, Doctor. <br>
FEDERICO: Where do you come from? You wear strange garments. <br>
DOCTOR: Around. Around. <br>
FEDERICO: You're already tall enough, Doctor. You will answer my
questions civilly and promptly or your body will be lengthened on the
rack. <br>
DOCTOR: Please don't threaten me, Count. I've come here to help you. <br>
ROSSINI: Sire, let me punish this insolent dog. <br>
FEDERICO: Wait. The fellow interests me. How can you help me? <br>
DOCTOR: A wave of energy has been released, Count. It's part of the
Mandragora Helix. It could do untold damage. And I must take it back to
the stars. <br>
(Everyone laughs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Please. Please. Please. Please listen. Listen, please. I
realise that must sound very strange to you. Let me put it this way. A
ball of heavenly fire has come down to Earth. It could consume
everything in its path. It could destroy the world. <br>
ROSSINI: His mind is afflicted, sire. It's the fall from the horse. <br>
FEDERICO: He professes sorcery. There is no gold for you in San
Martino. My seer Hieronymous is the finest in the land. <br>
DOCTOR: Ask your seer Hieronymous if he's ever seen an energy wave. <br>
FEDERICO: Do you tell the future? <br>
DOCTOR: Sometimes. <br>
FEDERICO: Can you tell mine? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
FEDERICO: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you don't have a future unless you listen to me. <br>
FEDERICO: Send Heironymous here. <br>

FEDERICO: If you are making sport with us, Doctor, we shall make sport
with your body. Be warned. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HIERONYMOUS: Now, answer me this. What does it
signify when Venus is in opposition to Saturn and a great shadow passes
over the Moon? <br>
DOCTOR: This is all a great waste of time. <br>
FEDERICO: Answer him. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it depends, doesn't it. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: On what? <br>
DOCTOR: On whether the Moon is made of cheese, on whether the cock
crows three times before dawn, and twelve hens lay addled eggs. <br>
HEIRONYMOUS: What school of philosophy is that? <br>
DOCTOR: I can easily teach him. All it requires is a colourful
imagination and a glib tongue. <br>
FEDERICO: And you, Doctor, have a mocking tongue. Prepare the
execution. <br>
DOCTOR: But you haven't listened to a word I've said! <br>
(As the Doctor is dragged away.) <br>
GIULIANO: Who is that man? <br>
FEDERICO: A spy. <br>

obelisk, your hour of glory will have come. Cup. <br>

headsman's feet from under him. The Doctor runs and jumps onto the back
of a horse which already has a rider.) <br>
FEDERICO: Fools! Stop him! <br>
(The Doctor pushes the rider out of the saddle and gallops away before
the pikesmen and other foot soldiers can get close.) <br>

dismounts and sends the horse on its way with a slap on the rump. Then
he leaps over a balustrade and runs down some steps and past the front
of a building where two men are with the body of the gate guard.) <br>
GUARD 1: Hey, fellow! <br>
(The Doctor runs on.) <br>
GUARD 1: You say there was no thunderbolt? <br>
GUARD 2: Nothing. He was found just beyond the gate. <br>
GUARD 1: The Duke must be told of this. <br>
(The Doctor runs into the market square and hides behind a display of
fabrics. His pursuers go in the opposite direction. He comes out of
hiding and they or others catch up to him. He runs down another flight
of steep steps.) </font></p>

bottom of the hill.) <br>
GIOVANNI: I swear he came in here, and there's no way out. Here, are we
chasing a phantom? <br>
SOLDIER: Or a worshipper of Demnos. Those devils know a hundred secret
ways under the city. <br>
GIOVANNI: A passage? Quick, then, let's find the trick. <br>
SOLDIER: No, I ain't going in there, Giovanni. Not for all the gold in
Rome. I know men who've tried. They've never been seen again. </font></p>

the ceiling as the Brother takes the dagger.) <br>

(The Doctor hides as a purple robed figure in a bearded gold mask
passes by. He follows and sees the man open a secret door in the
stonework and go through. Meanwhile, the Brothers are making obeisance
to the sacrificial maiden. The Priest gives the dagger to the Masked
Man, who then stands at Sarah's head and raises the blade high. Sarah
is quietly slid away into the arms of the Doctor, where she wakes, and
the blade stabs down into the stone of the altar.) <br>
MASKED MAN: Seize them! <br>
(Just before they can get through the secret door, the crypt goes dark
and the red energy bolt appears.) <br>

GUARD 1: What is it, Sire? <br>
GIULIANO: I don't know. His skin, such a strange colour. <br>
GUARD 1: I still think it could be a fire demon, Sire. I once heard of
a case in Florence <br>
GIULIANO: Yes, all right. You'd better get back to your duties. <br>
GUARD 1: Sire. <br>
(The guard captain leaves, and Marco enters.) <br>

here in this temple. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FEDERICO: Hieronymous. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: You will forgive me for not rising, Count. <br>
FEDERICO: Only the dead fail to stand in my presence. However, your
lack of courtesy is easily corrected. <br>
(Federico draws a dagger, and Hieronymous stands.) <br>
HIERONYMOUS: My lord, spare an old servant. It is only out of my love
for you. I am numb with fear for your life. <br>
FEDERICO: But your numbness has passed, I see. You're a fake,
Hieronymous. A fraud, a charlatan, a marketplace soothsayer. You and I
both know the truth of this, so just remember your place, Court
Astrologer. That way you may also keep your head. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: But, my lord, I bring you a warning. <br>
FEDERICO: Go on. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Intrigues are brewing. Plots are being prepared. You are
in great danger. <br>
FEDERICO: The only plots, Hieronymous, are mine, and they are going
well. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: It is written that a blow will be struck against you here,
in the palace. You must bring your guards here to protect your noble
person. <br>
FEDERICO: You try my patience, Hieronymous. You can no more tell the
stars than you can tell my chamber pot. Go. Get out of my sight! <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Very well, sire. But before Mars sinks to rest, the blow
will fall and your life will be forfeit. So it is written. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: I'd say you've had visitors. <br>
GIULIANO: Marco. My uncle's men must have taken him. <br>
DOCTOR: There's nothing you can do on your own, Giuliano. <br>
GIULIANO: But he's my friend, my loyal friend. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, listen. Listen, there are other considerations besides
your uncle and his petty ambitions. <br>
GIULIANO: Petty? They are far from petty, Doctor. I've called a
gathering of scholars here to celebrate my accession to the dukedom. My
uncle will do everything in his power to stop our meeting. <br>
DOCTOR: Who's coming? <br>
GIULIANO: The most learned men of all Italy. Scholars, artists, men of
the new sciences. <br>
DOCTOR: Is Leonardo da Vinci coming? <br>
GIULIANO: And his patron, the Duke of Milan. <br>
DOCTOR: If anything should happen to those men, they'd be thrown back
into a new dark age. <br>
(Sarah tries to get close to the Doctor, but) <br>
DOCTOR: You two stay here. <br>
SARAH: Where are you going? <br>
DOCTOR: I have an idea who the leader of the Brethren is. <br>
GIULIANO: Be careful, Doctor. The soldiers are everywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry about me. I'm not likely to miss Leonardo da Vinci.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Rossini comes out of a cell where a man is crying
out in pain.) <br>
FEDERICO: Scarlatti is enjoying his work? <br>
ROSSINI: He's a craftsman. <br>
FEDERICO: Nonetheless, these cries. I would prefer not to rouse the
entire palace. Has he weakened yet? <br>
ROSSINI: He is a stubborn ape, sire. <br>
FEDERICO: I'll have a word with him myself. Sometimes the voice of
reason is more effective than the burning iron. I have a task for you,
Rossini. <br>
ROSSINI: My lord. <br>
FEDERICO: The astrologer Hieronymous. It appears he's moving against
me. He's forecast my death. <br>
ROSSINI: My lord! <br>
FEDERICO: Don't be alarmed. He plucks these lies out of the sky. But I
want the old spider out of the city tonight. <br>
ROSSINI: Banished, sire? <br>
FEDERICO: Throw him out, and all his rubbish with him. <br>
(Federico enters the cell, where Marco is chained up on the wall. <br>
Meanwhile, Sarah follows the Doctor along marbled palace corridors,
poisoned needle at the ready. The Doctor knows she is there.) </font></p>

MARCO: Never. <br>
FEDERICO: Come, Marco. You're of noble birth, a man of intelligence.
Use your intelligence and save yourself pain. <br>
MARCO: I shall not lie against the Duke. You can kill me first. <br>
FEDERICO: No, but we may kill you afterwards. Scarlatti's enthusiasm is
such that not all survive his attentions. <br>
MARCO: You devils! <br>
FEDERICO: Come now, Marco. Confess that Giuliano is a follower of
Demnos and I will reward you well. Come, man, what is your answer? <br>

FEDERICO: You insolent fool. Now you will truly learn what suffering
is. </font></p>

cauldron, and there is a flash!) <br>
DOCTOR: Good evening. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: You! What are you? <br>
DOCTOR: It's time you and I had a little talk, Hieronymous. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Keep back. Keep away from me! <br>
DOCTOR: Not sure of yourself? Influence comes and goes? I suppose that
must be very worrying. <br>
(Sarah enters quietly. The Doctor looks at Hieronymous' golden mask on
a table.) <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Were you sent from the stars? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you could say that, yes. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: They told me, the voices, that I would be joined by
another. Give me the proof that you are the one. <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating. Predeluvian sandstone with a complex circuit of
base metal fused into it. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: You defile the sacred image of Demnos! Destroy him now! <br>
(The Doctor turns to see Sarah, smiling, needle at the ready.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Sarah. Poisoned needle? Drop it. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Strike him down! <br>
(The Doctor grabs Sarah's arm.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you don't want to hurt me, Sarah. I'm your friend,
remember? Your best friend. Drop it. <br>
(Sarah drops the needle.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
(Hieronymous stabs at the Doctor with a dagger.) <br>
HIERONYMOUS: The curse of Demnos on you, sorcerer! <br>
DOCTOR: You're getting a bit old for this, Hieronymous. <br>
(The Doctor kicks the dagger out of Hieronymous' hand as Rossini and
his guards enter to grab him.) <br>
SARAH: No! <br>
ROSSINI: Stop him! Don't let him get away! <br>
(Guards go after Hieronymous.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>

him in the corridor and grab him.) </font></p>

ROSSINI: No, sire. He's in the dungeons with the other prisoners. <br>
FEDERICO: Then it is finished, Rossini. The Duke and his troublemakers

ROSSINI: There is only Hieronymous, but he won't evade capture for

SARAH: I'm trying to remember what happened to me, but I can't. There's
just nothing. <br>
(The Doctor and Sarah are also chained up. Two guards are on duty.) <br>
DOCTOR: Drug induced hypnosis. Hieronymous is an old slyboots. <br>
SARAH: And I really tried to kill you? <br>
DOCTOR: You only did what you were ordered. What I expected. <br>
SARAH: But how did you know I'd been drugged? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've taken you to some strange places before and you've
never asked how you understood the local language. It's a Time Lord's
gift I allow you to share. But tonight when you asked me how you
understood Italian, I realised your mind had been taken over. <br>
SARAH: Poor Marco. <br>
(Giuliano is thrown into the cell.) <br>
GIULIANO: Doctor! Sarah! <br>
DOCTOR: See to Marco. <br>
GIULIANO: Marco, what have they done to you? <br>
MARCO: They made me speak against you. They forced me to say. <br>
GIULIANO: Say what? <br>
FEDERICO: That you, dear nephew, and this dog of a sorcerer, are in
league to revive the blasphemous cult of Demnos. <br>
GIULIANO: You stinking butcher! <br>
ROSSINI: My lord! All over the city, they're coming out of every
street. <br>
FEDERICO: The Brethren. They're moving towards the temple. </font></p>

HIERONYMOUS: Great god Demnos, we are ready to receive you into
ourselves. If we are worthy of your mighty presence, show yourself. <br>
(The red light envelopes Hieronymous, and energy bounces off the altar.
His gloves smoke. He gestures to a Brother, who gets up and joins hands
with him across the altar. The energy enters him too.) </font></p>

sorcerer. There is nothing now that will stop me from becoming Duke. <br>
DOCTOR: Count Federico, can't you understand? I'm not interested in
your political ambitions. Your enemies are not here in this dungeon.
They're in the temple. It isn't Giuliano you have to fear, it's
Hieronymous. <br>
FEDERICO: Ha! That fake. <br>
DOCTOR: That fake is the leader of the Brethren. <br>
FEDERICO: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. And he's possessed of extraordinary powers. Helix energy. <br>
ROSSINI: It's a trick, sire. <br>
FEDERICO: How do I know you're telling the truth? <br>
DOCTOR: You don't. But if Hieronymous isn't stopped, I promise you,
there'll be no dukedom for you or anyone else to rule over after
tonight. <br>
FEDERICO: I'll see for myself, and you will come with me. Unchain him. <br>
ROSSINI: Don't trust him, my lord. <br>
FEDERICO: I don't have to trust him. Keep these three here as hostages.
If I'm not back within the hour, you know what to do. I'll take two of
your best men. </font></p>

Federico and the Doctor enter dressed in black robes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whatever you do, Count, don't go near him. <br>
FEDERICO: Do I need your advice? When I give the signal, seize him. <br>
(The last of the Brethren have been energised. Federico walks forward.)
<br>
FEDERICO: Hieronymous! <br>
(Still in the red light, Hieronymous turns. Federico steps up and rips
off his mask.) <br>
FEDERICO: You traitor! <br>
(But there is no face under the mask, just a glowing light. Hieronymous
takes his mask as Federico backs away, then zaps the Count.) </font></p>

HIERONYMOUS: So shall perish all our Earthly enemies. Surround me with
a helix of powers, brothers, and none shall overcome us. All has
happened as was foretold down the centuries. The waiting, the prayers,
the sacrifices. Now, at last, the empire of Mandragora will encompass
the Earth, for Demnos is only the servant of Mandragora, and Mandragora
is a mighty master of all things. Let the power flood into you,
brothers. Tomorrow night we shall witness the last prophecy. As it is
written, Mandragora shall swallow the Moon! <br>

ROSSINI: It is time. Count Federico ordered the execution of these
traitors at the end of an hour. <br>
SARAH: If he didn't return. <br>
ROSSINI: Neither he, nor the sorcerer, nor any of their party have
returned from the temple. <br>
SARAH: You mean it's an hour already? Doesn't time fly when you're
enjoying yourself. <br>
ROSSINI: Take them down. <br>
GIULIANO: Stay, fellow. Rossini, you call us traitors, but lay one hand
on your prince and it's you who are the traitor. <br>
ROSSINI: I follow the Count. <br>
MARCO: You follow a murderer and a tyrant. It is to the Duke Giuliano
you owe allegiance. <br>
ROSSINI: Enough! Take them down. The execution block grows dry. <br>
MARCO: Infamous filth! <br>
GIULIANO: You call yourselves soldiers? Are we to die without a priest?
<br>
SARAH: Or even a hearty breakfast? <br>

ROSSINI: What have you done with the Count, sorcerer? <br>
DOCTOR: Your Count is dead. <br>
GIULIANO: Dead? My uncle? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, in the temple ruins. <br>
GIULIANO: How did he die? <br>
DOCTOR: Let's say Hieronymous gave him a blank look. <br>
ROSSINI: Seize him. Seize him! <br>
DOCTOR: Rossini, you don't have any authority to give orders any more.
Giuliano is the lawful ruler. <br>
GIULIANO: You men, are you with your prince? <br>
(The guards draw their swords against Rossini, who wisely kneels and
offers his weapon to Giuliano.) <br>
MARCO: Take him to the block, sire. <br>
GIULIANO: No, Marco. Take him away. His fate will be decided later. <br>
(The guards leave with Rossini.) <br>
MARCO: The evil is ended. At last you can rule without fear. <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong, Marco, wrong. The evil's only just beginning.
Hieronymous and the Brethren remain <br>
MARCO: Then destroy them! <br>
GIULIANO: What do you think, Doctor? <br>
MARCO: You're the prince, the men will rally to you. Lead them to the
temple and win your inheritance, sire. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, Marco, Marco. Giuliano, if you go near that temple, you
go to your death. <br>
GIULIANO: Then what do you suggest? <br>
DOCTOR: The Brothers are still absorbing power. Gather together all the
men you can, carpenters, stonemasons, soldiers, and block every
entrance to the palace. Turn it into a fortress. Because when the
Brethren attack, you're going to need one. <br>
GIULIANO: I'll explain it all, Marco. We'll see to it at once. <br>
(Giuliano and Marco leave.) <br>

MARCO: Sire. <br>

GIULIANO: What's begun? <br>
MARCO: The Brethren. They're driving people from the town. <br>
GIULIANO: Are you sure of this? <br>
MARCO: Those who refuse to leave are being destroyed by bolts of fire.
They've brought the forces of darkness out of those devilish catacombs.
<br>
GIULIANO: So, we're isolated now. Just the few of us left in this
palace. <br>
MARCO: Some of whom are the most precious heads in all Europe. <br>
GIULIANO: Do they know what we face? <br>
MARCO: I think they have some fear that all is not well. Their personal
guards keep close. And the King of Naples asked the reason for all the
noise. I sent back word it was in preparation for the masque. <br>
GIULIANO: The masque! I'd forgotten the day. Marco, it must be
cancelled. <br>
MARCO: Would you explain to your peers that your accession cannot be
celebrated because of a pagan uprising? <br>
GIULIANO: The masque cannot be held, Marco. It's too dangerous. <br>
MARCO: I have seen our defences, sire. This palace could be held
against an army and the Brothers are not an army, they're a fanatical
rabble. <br>
GIULIANO: Who can kill with bolts of fire. <br>
MARCO: Simple trickery. Hieronymous was always a cunning old fox. And
do not forget, my Lord, we have weapons of our own. <br>
(Giuliano sits on the throne for the first time.) <br>
GIULIANO: I don't know, Marco. <br>
MARCO: Giuliano, you're the ruler now, the leader. If you're seen to
falter at the first challenge, you may lose everything. There are eyes
watching you. There are those who will go from here saying that the
Duke of San Martino is weak, ready to be toppled. Better trust to your
guards and hold the masque as though all was normal. <br>
GIULIANO: Oh, you speak sense as always, dear Marco. But all is not
normal, you and I both know it. I'll seek the Doctor's advice. Where is
he? <br>

science. <br>
SARAH: Astrology? You mean when Mars in in the House of the Ram and all
that nonsense? <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense? It isn't nonsense, miss. Just you remember what
Hieronymous did to you. Mandragora doesn't conquer in the physical
sense. It dominates and controls by Helix energy, astral force. It
takes away from man the only thing worth having. <br>
SARAH: Which is? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a sense of purpose, what else? The ability granted to
every intelligent species to shape its own destiny. Once let Mandragora
gain control, and man's ambition wouldn't stretch beyond the next meal.
It'll turn you into sheep. Idle, mindless, useless sheep. <br>

it's molecular and by now must be spread pretty thinly among

DOCTOR: Could you get me one of these and a length of wire? <br>
GIULIANO: What, wire? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, wire. It must be at least a hundred and fifty years since
wire-drawing machines were invented. There must be some about the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PRIEST: The masque has begun. Shall I order our
brothers to surround the palace, Master? <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Yes. Kill all who try to escape. <br>
PRIEST: The others are inside. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Concealed from prying eyes. They await only my signal. <br>
PRIEST: Glory to Demnos. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: And to Mandragora. <br>
(They leave. A lion's head, and then the Doctor's head, appear from
behind the throne dais. The Doctor goes over to the altar, unwinding
the wire.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Throne room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A jester is doing a series of backward and
forward flips for the group of ladies and lords. Giuliano sits on his
throne.) <br>
MARCO: Sire. <br>
GIULIANO: Marco, what is it? <br>
MARCO: I've had a report from the guards. The Brethren. <br>
GIULIANO: What of them? <br>
MARCO: They're all around the palace. It's as though they're waiting
for something. <br>
GIULIANO: What could it be? A signal? <br>
MARCO: Perhaps. They're just standing silently, in the shadows. <br>
GIULIANO: Is Hieronymous with them? <br>
MARCO: He's not been seen, my lord. <br>
GIULIANO: I don't like it, Marco. Even our guests sense that
something's wrong. <br>
(The jester moves on to fire eating and juggling.) <br>
MARCO: It'll be a very good night, sire. Our walls are thick and solid,
and our guards well trained. A match for any in the land. At least we
have your uncle to thank for that. <br>
GIULIANO: So you think we have nothing to fear? <br>
MARCO: I think by dawn Hieronymous and his followers will have realised
their mistake, and they will leave San Martino to search for easier
pickings elsewhere. If needs be, sire, we can hold out here for a
month. And long before that, the armies of neighbouring states will
have come to our aid. <br>
(Sarah, dressed in a golden gown, approaches and curtsies.) <br>
SARAH: (sotto) Have you seen the Doctor? <br>
GIULIANO: No. <br>
SARAH: What's keeping him? He's been gone for ages. <br>
MARCO: It was gone eight of the evening when I told the guard. <br>
SARAH: All this waiting, not knowing what's happening to him. It's
worse than being with him. <br>
(A masked man bows to Sarah.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, me? <br>
(Sarah is lead to the head of the three couples about to dance.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Temple]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has put wire around the altar, and is
nailing it into the earth floor. Then he sits on the altar, gets out
his yoyo and waits, but not for long.) <br>
HIERONYMOUS: You profane the sacred stone. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, there. Had a hard day in the catacombs, have you? <br>
HIERONYMOUS: You profane the sacred stone! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come off it, Hieronymous. You know who I am. You can drop
all that bosh about sacred stones and profanity. Just be your natural
horrid self. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Why have you come here, Time Lord? <br>
DOCTOR: Would you believe it? I had no choice. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Had it not been you, there would have been other
travellers drawn into Mandragora Helix. Earth had to be possessed.
Unchecked, man's curiosity might lead him away from this planet until
ultimately the galaxy might not contain him, and we of Mandragora will
not allow a rival power within our domain. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you see, that's a great pity because I can't allow you to
interfere with Earth's progress. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: You arrogant dolt! How dare you oppose the might of
Mandragora! <br>
DOCTOR: It's part of a Time Lord's job to insist on justice for all
species. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Then you will be swept aside like the dirt that you are.
Die, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor is thrown back by the zap of energy.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time Lords don't die that easily, Hieronymous. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: I shall crush you! <br>
(Another zap, and another.) <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Now die. Now! <br>
(A further zap to the breastplate, and the Doctor takes longer to get
up this time. The energy glow behind Hieronymous' mask begins to dim.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Hieronymous. You can do better than that. Come on,
Heironymous. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Mandragora, help me! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Throne room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sarah is starting to get the hang of this formal
'country' dancing.) <br>
SARAH: No sign of the Doctor? <br>
GIULIANO: Not yet. <br>
SARAH: Well something must have happened to him. <br>
GIULIANO: Maybe he's hear already, wearing his costume. <br>
SARAH: No, he'd have let us know. Doctor! <br>
(A figure in a lion mask has entered behind the throne. Sarah goes over
to him.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor, what happened? Where've you been? Oh, stop playing the
fool and tell me what happened? Doctor? It is you? <br>
(The figure takes off the lion mask, to reveal no face, but a ball of
energy. She runs. That is the signal for the Brothers to cast aside
their cloaks. The whole room is lit with red light and people are
struck down with energy bolts. Then another figure in purple robe and
wearing Hieronymous' mask enters.) <br>
HEIRONYMOUS: Stop! Stop, brothers. The final sacrifice must be made in
our temple. Bring the victims of Mandragora down. <br>
GIULIANO: The Brethren. We've been tricked, betrayed! <br>
FIGURE: Silence! Take them below. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Temple]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Bound together with ropes, the survivors watch
through a hole in the wall as a shadow falls across the Moon.) <br>
SARAH: The eclipse! Look, it's beginning. <br>
HIERONYMOUS: Now Mandragora swallows the Moon. Now, as it was written,
the power of Mandragora will flood the Earth. Mandragora, we your
servants welcome you. Bestow your power upon us that we may rule over
the whole of your dominion. <br>
(The Brethren place their hands on the altar, and Helix energy appears
above them. There is a zapping noise, and the figures collapse, then
the red light dissipates to reveal a circle of empty cloaks and masks
on the floor. Heironymous walks up to the altar, removes his mask and
turns around.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I thought that was rather clever. (Hieronymous) A case of
energy squared. It puts Mandragora back to square one. (normal) Well,
don't just stand there, I'm in the market for congratulations.
(Hieronymous) I wouldn't even say no to a salami sandwich. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Woodland]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Goodbye, Giuliano. <br>
GIULIANO: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: This is lovely salami. Thank you. <br>
GIULIANO: Oh, it's we who should thank you. Won't you reconsider? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm already committed, sorry. <br>
GIULIANO: There's so much we could learn from you. <br>
DOCTOR: It'll all come in time. Keep an open mind. That's the secret. <br>
SARAH: Goodbye, Giuliano. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Sarah. <br>
(Giuliano kisses Sarah's hand.) <br>
SARAH: Oh! Coming. Hey, thanks for inviting me to the ball. Smashing. <br>
(Sarah and the Doctor walk along a path.) <br>
SARAH: Hey, what did you think of Leonardo? <br>
DOCTOR: Leonardo? Leonardo who? <br>
SARAH: Leonardo da Vinci. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that Leonardo. No, I didn't get to see him. Good thing,
too. <br>
SARAH: Oh? Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, his submarine design wasn't exactly practical, you know. <br>
(They reach the Tardis. Giuliano has followed, and waves to Sarah, who
waves back.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, poor Giuliano. He looked so wistful. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SARAH: Will he have any more trouble from Mandragora? <br>
DOCTOR: No, he won't, but the Earth will. Their constellation will be
in position to try again in about five hundred years. <br>
SARAH: Five hundred years. That takes us to just about the end of the
twentieth century. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. Now that was an interesting century. <br>
SARAH: What do you mean, was? <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
(They go into the Tardis, and Giuliano watches it dematerialise.) </font>
