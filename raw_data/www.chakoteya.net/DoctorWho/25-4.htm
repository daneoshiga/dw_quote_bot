and cracks his whip. Then he does a quick tap dance and starts his
rap.) <br>
RINGMASTER: Now welcome folks, I'm sure you'd like to know, we're at
the start of one big circus show. There are acts that are cool and acts
that amaze. Some acts are scary and some acts will daze. Acts of all
kinds, you can count on that, from folks that fly to disappearing acts.
There are lots of surprises for the family at the Greatest Show in the
Galaxy! So many strange surprises, I'm prepared to bet, whatever you've
seen before, you ain't seen nothing yet. </font></p>

cricket balls and the aid of a book called Juggling for the Complete
Klutz.) <br>
ACE [OC]: Professor? <br>
(Some clothes get thrown through the interior door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
ACE [OC]: Have you seen my Nitro Nine? <br>
DOCTOR: Isn't it in your rucksack? <br>
ACE [OC]: Yeah, but where's my rucksack? <br>
DOCTOR: Interesting question. <br>
(Ace emerges on her hands and knees with a long scarf around her neck.)
<br>
ACE: Things don't just vanish. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>

advertising the Psychic Circus - The Greatest Show in the Galaxy -
starts spouting smoke, then a three wheeled motorcycle appears, ridden
by a man with very large wings on his helmet. He drives it off the ramp
then opens a side pod and takes out a hot burger in a bun, then bites
into it with relish.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A curious six legged gizmo with two small solar
panels and an antenna on its head appears. The Doctor is on a step
ladder hunting for his ball in the console room ceiling.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's that peculiar noise? <br>
ACE: What peculiar noise? I don't hear any peculiar. <br>
(They notice the gizmo.) <br>
DOCTOR: How extraordinary. <br>
(He comes down the ladder.) <br>
DOCTOR: It materialised inside the Tardis. Just the kind of thing you'd
expect to see in this part of the galaxy. <br>
(The gizmo trundles across the floor to the console.) <br>
ACE: Is that just what you'd expect too, Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: Not entirely, no. <br>
(The gizmo then slaps a lead onto the console and the scanner starts up
with an advertisement.) <br>
ADVERT: Yes, it's festival time at the Psychic Circus, the Greatest
Show in the Galaxy! So why not come along and have the time of your
life with the nonstop action of its glittering circus ring. There's big
prizes <br>
ACE: No, I don't believe it. Junk mail. Used to get loads of this stuff
through the letterbox and now we're being bombarded with it inside the
Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, junk mail gets everywhere. <br>
ADVERT: If you want to watch or you want to compete, there's a great
time for you on the planet Segonax. The planet has easy access via our
special polyportable landing bays. <br>
(Ace disconnects the gizmo.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Ace, I thought you'd have been interested in the circus. <br>
ACE: No, kid's stuff. I went once. Didn't even have any tigers. It was
naff and it was boring. Apart from the clowns, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: What, you found them funny? <br>
ACE: No, creepy. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you're being very unfair. A lot of the acts in the
circus require a great deal of skill and courage. That's something you
should appreciate. Anyway, I rather fancy entering the Festival talent
contest myself. <br>
(And starts to play a pair of salad spoons on his leg.) <br>
ACE: Oh no, not the spoons again. <br>
(The gizmo reattaches itself.) <br>
ADVERT: Scared? <br>
ACE: What? <br>
ADVERT: Scared to come to the Psychic Circus? <br>
ACE: No. <br>
ADVERT: Scared to take part? <br>
ACE: No, course not. <br>
ADVERT: Well, if you are, then go ahead, ignore me. I quite understand.
<br>
ACE: I don't believe it. Junk mail that talks back. <br>
DOCTOR: Shall we just fling it away and forget about it? I mean, I'm
sure the Psychic Circus isn't scary at all. It's just a device to get
us to go. <br>
ACE: Okay, you win, junk box. I'm not scared of anything. </font></p>

ground. He falls. He is wearing a yellow jacket with lots of frogging
on it, while she is in a lacy floral dress.) <br>
FLOWERCHILD: Come on, we can't give up now. <br>
BELLBOY: They'll catch us, I know it. They'll drag us back to the
circus. <br>
FLOWERCHILD: Oh, Bellboy, please. You promised. You know it's down to
us now. We're the only ones left to fight. Come on. <br>
(A Bentley hearse cruises along the skyline. It stops and the passenger
window winds down to reveal a white-faced clown in undertakers
clothing. He gets out and looks up at a pair of kites in the sky,
flying without the aid of strings. His companion adjusts a control in
the car and the kites swoop away. They follow. <br>
Meanwhile, Bellboy and the Flowerchild arrive at the dunes. The kites
fly overhead.) <br>
BELLBOY: Flowerchild, look. Your kites, your beautiful kites. <br>

out.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: So this is Segonax. Not quite the green
and pleasant land we'd been led to expect. Still, I've had good reports
of the friendliness of the natives. <br>
ACE: Don't see these landing bays, Professor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I expect that's for those not fortunate enough to possess a
Tardis. <br>
ACE: So now where? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll ask for directions over there. </font></p>

nowhere as the tricycle rider drives along a dusty track, throwing the
remains of his burger over his shoulder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good afternoon. I'm the Doctor, this is my friend Ace. <br>
(The lady stallholder looks up from peeling a turnip. Everyone say Hi!
to the formidable <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0609859/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Peggy

STALLHOLDER: What sort of costume do you call that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't understand. <br>
STALLHOLDER: And her's is no better. We don't want your type around
here. <br>
(She pushes between Ace and the Doctor. His hand goes into something
gunky on the stall, possibly the Plaup from Vulpana at 30 epsy.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, and what type might that be? <br>
STALLHOLDER: Wierdos. You can tell them at a glance, you know. <br>
ACE: Friendly natives, eh, Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: Let's not be hasty. <br>
(The Stallholder uses a sharp cleaver to chop a melon.) </font></p>

BELLBOY: No. The kites will track us forever. <br>
FLOWERCHILD: One of us must get there. <br>
(She kisses him, then takes off a large circular earring.) <br>
FLOWERCHILD: I want you to have this. <br>
BELLBOY: Thanks. Look, I'll wait here awhile and see if I can find a
longer route round. I shall draw them after me. <br>
FLOWERCHILD: No silly risks, now. <br>

of a large fruit.) <br>
ACE: Yuck. Do we really have to eat this muck? <br>
DOCTOR: Elementary diplomacy, my dear Ace. She apparently thinks we're
a pair of undesirable intergalactic hippies. We must try and convince
her we're nice, clean-living people who eat up all our fresh fruit and
pay our way. <br>
ACE: Paying good money for this muck is daylight robbery. Do I have to
finish it? <br>
DOCTOR: Every last bite. Besides, we want the charming lady to tell us
how to find the circus, don't we. Delicious, madam. Quite delicious. </font></p>

isn't it? What are you waiting for? Come on! <br>
(Flowerchild has got to a painted bus with a picture of Bellboy on it
and the slogan The Road is Open and the Rides are Free on it. Also Give
Some Money. She goes inside.) </font></p>

DOCTOR: Er, no. Delicious but extremely filling. I'm sure you will have
gathered by now, dear lady, we're not the kind of hobbledyhoys and
vagabonds you take such exception to. Indeed, as I said before, I'm known as
the Doctor. <br>
STALLHOLDER: Some people will call themselves anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, be that as it may, we would appreciate your help.
You see, we're looking for <br>

STALLHOLDER: Here comes another one of your lot. <br>
ACE: Look at that ace bike, Professor. <br>
(The bike pulls up in a series of backfires, and Ace runs over.) <br>
ACE: Need a hand? I reckon it could be a stuck valve. <br>
NORD: Get lost. <br>
ACE: It's a great bike. <br>
NORD: Go on, hop it, before I get angry. <br>
ACE: Well, if you don't want to save yourself some time, then it's up
to you. Course, it could be a valve <br>
NORD: I've told you, girl, get lost! Or I'll do something horrible to
your ears. <br>
ACE: Suit yourself. I hope your big end goes. <br>
STALLHOLDER: He'll be going there. They all go there, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: Go where? <br>
STALLHOLDER: The Psychic Circus. All the riff-raff go there. All the
infernal extraterrestrials like him. Monopods from Lelex, Doctors. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't understand. You say that he's going to the circus? <br>
STALLHOLDER: Of course. Everyone of them who's up to no good goes
there. We locals wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it far, this appalling spectacle? <br>
STALLHOLDER: Miles and miles. Why do you suppose he's got that noisy
monstrosity polluting the countryside? Here, you're not thinking of
going there, are you? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, the very idea, no. Just a moment, would you excuse me? <br>
(The Doctor goes over to Ace and Nord.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ace, any chance of a lift, do you think? <br>
ACE: Worth a try, I suppose. He doesn't look after that bike, you know.
If only he'd let me have a go,<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, never mind, Ace. Let's concentrate on getting a lift
to the circus. Excuse me. If you're going to the circus, I wonder if
could possibly give <br>

ACE: And this is nothing like a nice walk in the countryside. <br>
(The hearse comes down the track towards them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, now, it could be worse. You could be carrying that
heavy rucksack of yours. <br>
ACE: Yeah, what about my rucksack, Professor? What did you do with it? <br>
(The hearse sounds its horn and the Doctor pushes Ace out of the way as
it drives straight between them without slowing.) <br>
DOCTOR: They seem to be in rather a hurry. Looking for customers. <br>
(Further on.) <br>
ACE: Well, I wouldn't be so chuffed if I kept getting visitors like
Nord the Vandal, I suppose. <br>
DOCTOR: That's true. But then, how do they expect a hard case like him
to going to the circus anyway? <br>
ACE: Maybe he got conned, like I was. <br>
DOCTOR: Something evil's happened here, I can feel it. <br>
ACE: To do with the circus? <br>

CAPTAIN: I was probably the first person to visit the valley for
several millennia, at the very least. So something like this, which for
the ordinary dull old stop-at-home might seem quite extraordinary, is

DOCTOR: Well, I could be wrong, of course, but isn't it from the Groz
Valley of Melogothon? <br>
CAPTAIN: Good. Very good. <br>
ACE: (to Mags) I'll give you a hand. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Ace, wait a minute. <br>
CAPTAIN: Were you ever on Melogothon, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well as a matter of fact, I was. <br>
CAPTAIN: The frozen pits of Overod are worth seeing, of course, though
much overrated, I feel. All right for the trainee explorer. Old hands
like myself need something a bit more exotic. <br>
DOCTOR: Why come here, then? <br>
CAPTAIN: Sorry, old boy? <br>
DOCTOR: I said, why bother to come here? <br>
CAPTAIN: Well, I'm told the Psychic Circus is quite an interesting
little show, particularly at this time, when everybody turns up to
compete in the Festival. Yes, besides, she wanted to come. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you often travel together? <br>
CAPTAIN: Of late, yes. I found her on the planet Vulpana. Between you
and me, old boy, she's rather an unusual little specimen. <br>
DOCTOR: Of what? <br>
CAPTAIN: Ah, that would be telling, old boy. What about yours? <br>
DOCTOR: I never think of Ace as a specimen of anything. <br>
CAPTAIN: Keep your shirt on, Doctor. Everything's a specimen of
something. Take that robot over there, for example. <br>
ACE: What do you reckon, Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose it was buried for some good reason. <br>
ACE: Well, maybe we'll find out what that reason was, eh, Professor? <br>

grabbing her leg.) <br>

CAPTAIN: I hate it when this happens. She can't control herself, of
course, and like all her kind she'll destroy whatever comes in her
path. Which, I'm afraid, in this case has to be you. <br>
(The family give this act a score of three nines.) <br>
CAPTAIN: This circus is only the half of it, you see, old chap. These

self-interest stakes. <br>

her away from himself.) <br>

have to destroy everything that crosses your path. I don't believe
that. Mags! <br>

family are sitting. They all stand up and their eyes glow green. A high
pitched sound makes the Doctor tumble backwards down the seating and
into the ring, where Mags is waiting.) <br>

takes a small blue eye from the box and puts it on his medallion.) <br>

briefly puts the cover over it to extinguish them and removes a snake
from it. Mum throws a thunderbolt.) <br>
