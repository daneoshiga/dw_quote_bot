Amy is navigating by tulip symbols, like on a road rally.) <br>
AMY: Okay, left. Sharp turn! Okay, right. No, no, no, I mean left. No,
sorry, right, right. I definitely meant right. Now loop the loop. <br>
(More corn gets crushed beneath the tyres.) <br>
AMY: Stop! Stop! <br>
(And there, in the middle of the crop circle they have just made, is
the Tardis. The Doctor comes out, holding a copy of the Leadworth
Chronicle with the headline Leadworth's Crop Circle.) <br>
DOCTOR: Seriously? <br>
(They have made the word Doctor in the field.) <br>
RORY: Well, you never answer your phone. <br>
AMY: Okay, you've had all summer. Have you found her? Have you found
Melody? <br>
DOCTOR: Permission? <br>
RORY: Granted. <br>
(The Doctor gives the newspaper to Rory and hugs Amy.) <br>
DOCTOR: You know who she grows up to be, so you know I will find her. <br>
AMY: But you haven't yet. <br>
RORY: Hang on. What's this bit? <br>
(There is a line through the middle of their crop design in the
photograph.) <br>
AMY: That wasn't us. <br>
(Another car is driving towards them through the corn.) <br>
ALL: Argh! <br>
(They dive for safety as the Chevrolet Corvette skids to a halt by the
Tardis. A young woman gets out wearing a River Song type costume.) <br>
MELS: You said he was funny. You never said he was hot. <br>
RORY: Mels! <br>
AMY: What are you doing here? <br>
MELS: Following you. What do you think? <br>
RORY: Er, where did you get the car? <br>
(Police sirens in the distance.) <br>
MELS: It's mine. Ish. <br>
AMY: Oh, Mels, not again. <br>
RORY: You can't keep doing this. You're going to end up in prison. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. Hello. Doctor not following this. Doctor very lost. You
never said I was hot? <br>
MELS: Is that the phone box? The bigger on the inside phone box? Oh,
time travel. That's just brilliant. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.
I'm their best mate. <br>
DOCTOR: Then why don't I know you? I danced with everyone at the
wedding. The women were all brilliant. The men were a bit shy. <br>
MELS: I don't do weddings. <br>
(The sirens get closer.) <br>
MELS: And that's me out of time. <br>
(Mels pulls a gun on the Doctor.) <br>
AMY: Mels! <br>
RORY: For God's sake! <br>
AMY: What are you doing? <br>
MELS: I need out of here, now. <br>
(A helicopter is coming, too.) <br>
DOCTOR: Anywhere in particular? <br>
MELS: Well, let's see. You've got a time machine, I've got a gun. What
the hell. Let's kill Hitler.

AMY: Doctor? Doctor, you did it. He did it! <br>
(River steps out from behind the console.) <br>
RIVER: I seem to be able to fly her. She showed me how. She taught me.
The Doctor says I'm the child of the Tardis. What does he mean? <br>
AMY: Where is he?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMY: You can't die now. I know you don't die now. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Pond, you've got a schedule for everything. <br>
AMY: But it doesn't make any sense. <br>
RORY: Doctor, what do we do? Come on. How do we help you? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Sorry, Rory, you can't. Nobody can. Ponds, listen to me. I
need to talk to your daughter. <br>
(Rory and Amy move away from the Doctor, and let River approach.) <br>
DOCTOR: Find her. Find River Song and tell her something from me. <br>
RIVER: Tell her what? <br>
(The Doctor whispers in her ear.) <br>
RIVER: Well, I'm sure she knows. <br>
(The Doctor is dead.) <br>
RIVER: Who's River Song? <br>
AMY: Are you still working? Because I'm still a relative. Access files
on River Song. <br>
TESELECTA-AMY: Records available. <br>
AMY: Show me her. Show me River Song. <br>
(The Teselecta transforms.) <br>
AMY: What did he say? The Doctor gave you a message for River Song.
What was it? <br>
(River starts to glow.) <br>
AMY: What's happening? River, what are you doing? <br>
RIVER: Just tell me. The Doctor, is he worth it? <br>
AMY: Yes! Yes, he is! <br>
(River pours her golden regeneration energy into the Doctor, and he
revives.) <br>
DOCTOR: River. No. What are you doing? <br>
RIVER: Hello, sweetie. <br>
(River kisses the Doctor.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(River wakes up in a bed.) <br>
AMY: Hey. <br>
RIVER: Hey. Where am I? <br>
AMY: You're safe now. Apparently, you used all your remaining
regenerations in one go. You shouldn't have done that. <br>
RIVER: Mother, I had to try. <br>
AMY: I know. <br>
RIVER: He said no-one could save him, but he must have known I could. <br>
DOCTOR: Rule one. The Doctor lies. <br>
NURSE: She just needs to rest. She'll be absolutely fine. <br>
DOCTOR: No, she won't. She will be amazing. <br>
(The Doctor leaves a brand new Tardis-style diary on the bedside
cabinet.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMY: So that's it, se leave her there? <br>
DOCTOR: Sisters of the Infinite Schism. Greatest hospital in the
universe. <br>
AMY: Yeah, but she's our daughter. Doctor, she's River and she's our
daughter. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, I know. But we have to let her make her own way now. We
have too much foreknowledge. Dangerous thing, foreknowledge. <br>
(His Teselecta biography is on the scanner.) <br>
AMY: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. <br>
(He turns it off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Just some data I downloaded from the Teselecta. Very boring. <br>
RORY: Doctor, River was brainwashed to kill you, right? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, she did kill me, and then she used her remaining lives to
bring me back. As first dates go, I'd say that was mixed signals. <br>
RORY: But that stuff that they put in her head, is that gone now? The
River that we know in the future, she is in prison for murder. <br>
AMY: Whose murder? Will we see her again? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, she'll come looking for us. <br>
AMY: Yeah, but how? How do people even look for you? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Pond. Haven't you figured that one out yet?
