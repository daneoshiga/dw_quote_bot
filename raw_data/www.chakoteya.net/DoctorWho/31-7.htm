very heavily pregnant Amy is mixing ingredients in a bowl, when she
suddenly puts it down and gasps.) <br>

mix.) <br>
RORY: Ah. Okay, okay. <br>
AMY: False alarm. <br>
RORY: What? <br>
AMY: Well, I don't know what it feels like. I've never had a baby
before. <br>
(The sound of the Tardis materialising.) <br>
AMY: No. <br>
RORY: I know, leaf blowers. Use a rake. <br>
AMY: No, it's. <br>
(The Tardis parks herself directly outside the front window.) <br>
AMY: I knew. I just knew.

rockery to get out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rory! <br>
RORY: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I've crushed your flowers. <br>
RORY: Oh, Amy will kill you. <br>
DOCTOR: Where is she? <br>
RORY: She'll need a bit longer. <br>
DOCTOR: Whenever you're ready, Amy. <br>
(Amy waddles out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, way-hey! You've swallowed a planet. <br>
AMY: I'm pregnant. <br>
DOCTOR: You're huge. <br>
AMY: Yeah, I'm pregnant. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at you. When worlds collide. <br>
AMY: Doctor, I'm pregnant. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, look at you both. Five years later and you haven't changed
a bit, apart from age and size. <br>
AMY: Oh, it's good to see you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you pregnant?

RORY: It's Upper Leadworth, actually. We've gone slightly upmarket. <br>
DOCTOR: Where is everyone? <br>
AMY: This is busy. Okay, it's quiet, but it's really restful and
healthy. Loads of people here live well into their nineties. <br>
(Including the old woman twitching her net curtains as they pass.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don't let that get you down. <br>
AMY: It's not getting me down. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I wanted to see how you were. You know me, I don't just
abandon people when they leave the Tardis. This Time Lord's for life.
You don't get rid of your old pal the Doctor so easily. <br>
AMY: Hmm. You came here by mistake, didn't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, bit of a mistake. But look, what a result. Look at this
bench. What a nice bench. What will they think of next? So. What do you
do around here
to stave off the, you know <br>
AMY: Boredom. <br>
DOCTOR: Self harm. <br>
RORY: We relax. <br>
DOCTOR: (silent) Relax. <br>
RORY: We live. We listen to the birds. <br>
AMY: Yeah, see? Birds. Those are nice. <br>
RORY: We didn't get time to listen to birdsong back in the Tardis days,
did we? <br>
(The bird is very loud.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh blimey, my head's a bit. Ooo. Er, no, you're right, there
wasn't a lot of time for birdsong back in the good old <br>

haired Rory and non-pregnant Amy enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: Days. What? No, yes, sorry, what? Oh, you're okay. Oh, thank
God. I had a terrible nightmare about you two. That was scary. Don't
ask. You don't want to know. You're safe now. <br>
(The Doctor hugs Amy.) <br>
AMY: Oh, okay. <br>
DOCTOR: That's what counts. Blimey. Never dropped off like that before.
Well, never, really. I'm getting on a bit, you see. Don't let the cool
gear fool you. Now, what's wrong with the console? Red flashing lights.
I bet they mean something. <br>
RORY: Er, Doctor, I also had a kind of dream thing. <br>
AMY: Yeah, so did I. <br>
RORY: Not a nightmare, though, just, er, we were married. <br>
AMY: Yeah. In a little village. <br>
RORY: A sweet little village, and you were pregnant. <br>
AMY: Yes, I was huge. I was a boat. <br>
RORY: So you had the same dream, then? Exactly the same dream? <br>
AMY: Are you calling me a boat? <br>
RORY: And Doctor, you were visiting. <br>
AMY: Yeah, yeah, you came to our cottage. <br>
RORY: How can we have the same dream? It doesn't make any sense. <br>
AMY: And you had a nightmare about us. What happened to us in the
nightmare? <br>
DOCTOR: It was a bit similar, in some aspects. <br>
RORY: Which aspects? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, all of them. <br>
AMY: You had the same dream. <br>
DOCTOR: Basically. <br>
RORY: You said it was a nightmare. <br>
DOCTOR: Did I say nightmare? No, more of a really good mare. Look, it
doesn't matter. We all had some kind of psychic episode. We probably
jumped a time track or something. Forget it. We're back to reality now.
<br>
(A bird is singing.) <br>
AMY: Doctor? If we're back to reality, how come I can still hear birds?
<br>
RORY: Yeah, the same birds. The same ones we heard in the </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RORY: Dream. Oh! Sorry. Nodded off. Stupid. God, I
must be overdoing it. I was dreaming we were back on the Tardis. <br>
(The Doctor checks his braces and walks away.) <br>
RORY: You had the same dream, didn't you? <br>
AMY: Weren't we just saying the same thing? <br>
RORY: But we thought this was the dream, didn't we? <br>
AMY: I think so. Why do dreams have to fade so quickly? <br>
RORY: Doctor, what is going on? <br>
AMY: Is this because of you? Is this some Time Lordy thing because
you've shown up again? <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me. Trust nothing. From now on, trust nothing you
see, hear or feel. <br>
RORY: But we're awake now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. You thought you were awake on the Tardis, too. <br>
AMY: But we're home. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, you're home. You're also dreaming. Trouble is, Rory, Amy,
which is which? Are we flashing forwards or backwards? Hold on tight.
This is going be a tricky one.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Oh, this is bad. I don't like this. <br>
(He kicks the console, and hurts his leg.) <br>
DOCTOR: Argh. Never use force. You just embarrass yourself. Unless
you're cross, in which case, always use force. <br>
AMY: Shall I run and get the manual? <br>
DOCTOR: I threw it in a supernova. <br>
AMY: You threw the manual in a supernova? Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I disagreed with it. Stop talking to me when I'm cross.
<br>
RORY: Okay, but whatever's wrong with the Tardis, is that what caused
us to dream about the future? <br>
DOCTOR: If we were dreaming of the future. <br>
AMY: Well, of course we were. We were in Leadworth. <br>
RORY: Upper Leadworth. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, and we could still be in Upper Leadworth, dreaming of
this. Don't you get it? <br>
AMY: No, okay? No, this is real. I'm definitely awake now. <br>
DOCTOR: And you thought you were definitely awake when you were all
elephanty. <br>
AMY: Hey. Pregnant. <br>
DOCTOR: And you could be giving birth right now. This could be the
dream. I told you. Trust nothing we see or hear or feel. Look around
you. Examine everything. Look for all the details that don't ring true.
<br>
RORY: Okay, we're in a spaceship that's bigger on the inside than the
outside. <br>
AMY: With a bow tie-wearing alien. <br>
RORY: So maybe what rings true isn't so simple. <br>
DOCTOR: Valid point. <br>
(The Tardis switches off. There is just a faint glow from the time
rotor left.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's dead. We're in a dead time machine. <br>
(A bird sings. Rory hugs Amy.) <br>
DOCTOR: Remember, this is real. But when we wake up in the other place,
remember how real this feels. <br>
AMY: It is real. I know it's real.

past. The church clock is chiming as Rory and Amy wake up on a bench
outside the Library.) <br>
AMY: Okay, this is the real one. Definitely this one. It's all solid. <br>
DOCTOR: It felt solid in the Tardis too. You can't spot a dream while
you're having it. <br>
(The Doctor waves his hand in front of his face.) <br>
RORY: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Looking for motion blur, pixilation. It could be a computer
simulation. I don't think so, though. <br>
(A little old woman walks past.) <br>
HAMIT: Hello, Doctor. <br>
RORY: Hi. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. You're a doctor. <br>
RORY: Yeah. And unlike you, I've actually passed some exams. <br>
DOCTOR: A doctor, not a nurse. Just like you've always dreamed. How
interesting. <br>
RORY: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: Your dream wife, your dream job, probably your dream baby.
Maybe this is your dream. <br>
RORY: It's Amy's dream too. Isn't it, Amy? <br>
AMY: Yes. Course it is, yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: What's that? <br>
AMY: Old people's home. <br>
(The sign outside says SARN Residential Care Home. A man is looking out
of a window, then a woman and another man.) <br>
DOCTOR: You said everyone here lives to their nineties. There's
something here that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a
stick. <br>

POGGIT: Hello, Rory love. <br>
RORY: Hello, Mrs Poggit. How's your hip? <br>
POGGIT: A bit stiff. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, easy, D-96 compound, plus. No, you don't have that yet.
Forget that. <br>
POGGIT: Who's your friend? A junior doctor? <br>
RORY: Yes. <br>
POGGIT: Can I borrow you? You're the size of my grandson. <br>
(The Doctor has to try on the sweater Mrs Poggit is knitting.) <br>
DOCTOR: Slightly keen to move on. Freak psychic schism to sort out.
You're incredibly old, aren't you? <br>

birdsong starts and they fall asleep.) </font></p>

this is definitely real. It's definitely this one. I keep saying that,
don't I? <br>

DOCTOR: The heating's off. <br>
RORY: The heating's off? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Put on a jumper. That's what I always do. <br>
RORY: Er, yes. Sorry about Mrs Poggit. She's so lovely though. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't believe her nice old lady act if I were you. <br>
AMY: What do you mean, act? <br>
DOCTOR: Everything's off. Sensors, core power. We're drifting. The
scanner's down so we can't even see out. We could be anywhere. Someone,
something, is overriding my controls. <br>
(A little man in a red bow tie and tweed jacket suddenly appears on the
stairs behind the Doctor.) <br>
DREAM LORD: Well, that took a while. Honestly, I'd heard such good
things. Last of the Time Lords, the Oncoming Storm. Him in the bow tie.
<br>
DOCTOR: How did you get into my Tardis? What are you? <br>
DREAM LORD: What shall we call me? Well, if you're the Time Lord, let's
call me the Dream Lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Nice look. <br>
DREAM LORD: This? No, I'm not convinced. Bow ties? <br>
(The Doctor throws his sonic screwdriver through the Dream Lord.) <br>
DREAM LORD: Interesting. I'd love to be impressed, but Dream Lord. It's
in the name, isn't it? Spooky. Not quite there. <br>
(He pops up behind them.) <br>
DREAM LORD: And yet, very much here. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll do the talking, thank you. Amy, want to take a guess at
what that is? <br>
AMY: Er, Dream Lord. He creates dreams. <br>
DOCTOR: Dreams, delusions, cheap tricks. <br>
DREAM LORD: And what about the gooseberry, here. Does he get a guess? <br>
RORY: Er, listen, mate. If anyone's the gooseberry round here, it's the
Doctor. <br>
DREAM LORD: Well now, there's a delusion I'm not responsible for. <br>
RORY: No, he is. Isn't he, Amy. <br>
DREAM LORD: Oh, Amy, have to sort your men out. Choose, even. <br>
AMY: I have chosen. Of course I've chosen. <br>
(Amy is standing close to the Doctor, but she hits Rory.) <br>
AMY: It's you, stupid. <br>
RORY: Oh, good. Thanks. <br>
(The Dream Lord pops behind them again.) <br>
DREAM LORD: You can't fool me. I've seen your dreams. Some of them
twice. Amy. Blimey, I'd blush if I had a blood supply or a real face. <br>
DOCTOR: Where did you pick up this cheap cabaret act? <br>
DREAM LORD: Me? Oh, you're on shaky ground. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I? <br>
DREAM LORD: If you had any more tawdry quirks you could open up a
Tawdry Quirk Shop. The madcap vehicle, the cockamamie hair, the clothes
designed by a first-year fashion student. I'm surprised you haven't got
a little purple space dog just to ram home what an intergalactic wag
you are. Where was I? <br>
RORY: You were <br>
DREAM LORD: I know where I was. So, here's your challenge. Two worlds.
Here, in the time machine, and there, in the village that time forgot. <br>
One is real, the other's fake. And just to make it more interesting,
you're going to face in both worlds a deadly danger, but only one of
the dangers is real. Tweet, tweet. Time to sleep. <br>

DREAM LORD: Oh. Or are you waking up? <br>
(The Doctor tries to stay awake, but finally fails.)

wearing a dark suit and tie, with an x-ray in his hand.) <br>
DREAM LORD: Oh, this is bad. This is very, very bad. Look at this
X-ray. Your brain is completely see-through. But then, I've always been
able to see through you, Doctor. <br>
AMY: Always? What do you mean, always? <br>
DREAM LORD: Now then, the prognosis is this. If you die in the dream,
you wake up in reality. Healthy recovery in next to no time. Ask me
what happens if you die in reality? <br>
RORY: What happens? <br>
DREAM LORD: You die, stupid. That's why it's called reality. <br>
AMY: Have you met the Doctor before? Do you know him? Doctor, does he? <br>
DREAM LORD: Now don't get jealous. He's been around, our boy. But never
mind that. You've got a world to choose. One reality was always too
much for you, Doctor. Take two and call me in the morning. <br>
(The Dream Lord vanishes.) <br>
RORY: Okay, I don't like him. <br>
AMY: Who is he? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. It's a big universe. <br>
AMY: Why is he doing this? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe because he has no physical form. That gets you down after
a while, so he's taking it out on folk like us who can touch and eat
and feel. <br>
RORY: What does he mean, deadly danger, though? Nothing deadly has
happened here. I mean, a bit of natural wastage, obviously. <br>

on. <br>
RORY: Why would they leave? <br>
AMY: And what did you mean about Mrs Poggit's nice old lady act? <br>
DOCTOR: One of my tawdry quirks. Sniffing out things that aren't what
they seem. So, come on, let's think. The mechanics of this reality
split we're stuck in. Time asleep exactly matches time in our dream
world, unlike in conventional dreams. <br>
RORY: And we're all dreaming the same dream at the same time. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, sort of communal trance. Very rare, very complicated. I'm
sure there's a dream giveaway, a tell, but my mind isn't working
because this village is so dull! I'm slowing down, like you two have. <br>

Stars burn. <br>
DOCTOR: So's this one. It's just burning cold. <br>
RORY: Is that possible? <br>
DOCTOR: I can't know everything. Why does everybody expect me to,
always? <br>
RORY: Okay, this is something you haven't seen before. So does that
mean this is the dream? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but there it is, and I'd say we've got about
fourteen minutes until we crash into it. But that's not a problem. <br>
RORY: Because you know how to get us out of this? <br>
DOCTOR: Because we'll have frozen to death by then. <br>
AMY: Oh, then what are we going to do? <br>

be the battle that we have to lose. <br>

only one man to save the day, huh? I just wanted a nice village and a

doctor from Gallifrey, who ended up throwing his life away. He let down

RORY: Just leave her. <br>
DREAM LORD: Yes, you're not quite so impressive, but I know where your
heart lies, don't I, Amy Pond? <br>
AMY: Shut up. Just shut up and leave me alone. <br>
DREAM LORD: But listen. You're in there. Loves a redhead, the Doctor.
Has he told you about Elizabeth the First? Well, she thought she was
the first. <br>
DOCTOR: Drop it. Drop all of it. I know who you are. <br>
DREAM LORD: Course you don't. <br>
DOCTOR: Course I do. No idea how you can be here, but there's only one
person in the universe who hates me as much as you do. <br>
DREAM LORD: Never mind me. Maybe you should worry about them. <br>
(The old people are walking across the grass. The Dream Lord vanishes.)
<br>
RORY: Hi. Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, we were wondering where you went. To get reinforcements,
by the look of it. Are you all right? You look a bit tense. <br>
RORY: Hello, Mister Nainby. <br>
DOCTOR: Rory. <br>
RORY: Mister Nainby ran the sweet shop. He used to slip me the odd free
toffee. <br>
(Nainby grabs Rory by the collar and lifts him off his feet.) <br>
RORY: Did I not say thank you? <br>
(Rory gets thrown into the mud by the swings.) <br>
RORY: How did he do that? <br>
DOCTOR: I suspect he's not himself. Don't get comfortable here. You may
have to run, fast. <br>
AMY: Can't we just talk to them? <br>
(The old people open their mouths, and an eye looks out.) <br>
AMY: There is an eye in her mouth. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a whole creature inside her. Inside all of them.
They've been there for years, living and waiting. <br>
RORY: That is disgusting. They're not going to be peeping out of
anywhere else, are they? <br>
(Mrs Poggit breaths a stream of green gas at them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Run. Okay, leave them, leave them. Talk to me. Talk to me. You
are Eknodines. A proud, ancient race. you're better than this. <br>
(Rory and Amy run off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why are you hiding away here? Why aren't you at home? <br>
POGGIT: We were driven from our planet by <br>
DOCTOR: Planet by upstart neighbours. <br>
NAINBY: So we've <br>
DOCTOR: Been living here inside the bodies of old humans for years. No
wonder they live so long. You're keeping them alive. <br>
POGGIT: We were humbled and destroyed. Now we will do the same to
others. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Makes sense, I suppose. Credible enough. Could be real. <br>
(A paper boy wheels his bicycle past.) <br>
LAD: Morning. <br>
(Mrs Poggit breaths on him and he turns to dust.) <br>
DOCTOR: You need to leave this planet.

RORY: Okay, this is crazy. She loves me. I fixed her depression. She's

DOCTOR: Oh, pipe down. I'm busy. <br>

DOCTOR: This one. <br>

die looking like a Peruvian folk band. <br>
RORY: We're not going to die. <br>
DOCTOR: No, we're not, but our time's running out. If we fall asleep
here we're in trouble. If we could divide up, then we'd have an active
presence in each world, but the Dream Lord is switching us between the
worlds. Why? Why? what's the logic? <br>
DREAM LORD: Good idea, veggie. Let's divide you three up, so I can have
a little chat with our lovely companion. Maybe I'll keep her, and you
can have Pointy Nose to yourself for all eternity, should you manage to
clamber aboard some sort of reality. <br>

with me. Spooky old, not to be trusted me. Anything could happen. <br>
AMY: Who are you, and what do you want? The Doctor knows you, but he's
not telling me who you are. And he always does. Takes him a while
sometimes, but he tells me. So you're something different. <br>

you really give him up for a bumbling country doctor who thinks the

maybe birthdays. <br>
AMY: What are we doing now? <br>
DOCTOR: Me, I'm going to blow up the Tardis. <br>
RORY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Notice how helpful the Dream Lord was? Okay, there was
misinformation, red herrings, malice, and I could have done without the
limerick. But he was always very keen to make us choose between dream
and reality. <br>
AMY: What are you doing?. <br>
RORY: Doctor, the Dream Lord conceded. This isn't a dream. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. <br>
AMY: Stop him. <br>
DOCTOR: Star burning cold? Do me a favour. The Dream Lord has no power
over the real world. He was offering us a choice between two dreams. <br>

DOCTOR: Because I know who he is. <br>
(KaBOOM. The Tardis is back to normal. Rory and Amy enter to see the
Doctor looking at something small and yellow on his palm.) <br>
DOCTOR: Any questions? <br>
AMY: Er, what's that? <br>
DOCTOR: A speck of psychic pollen from the candle meadows of Karass don
Slava. Must have been hanging around for ages. Fell in the time rotor,
heated up and induced a dream state for all of us. <br>
(He takes it to the door and blows it into space.) <br>
RORY: So that was the Dream Lord then? Those little specks. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. No. Sorry, wasn't it obvious? The Dream Lord was me.
Psychic pollen. It's a mind parasite. It feeds on everything dark in
you, gives it a voice, turns it against you. I'm nine hundred and
seven. It had a lot to go on. <br>
AMY: But why didn't it feed on us, too? <br>
DOCTOR: The darkness in you pair, it would've starved to death in an
instant. I choose my friends with great care. Otherwise, I'm stuck with
my own company, and you know how that works out. <br>
AMY: But those things he said about you. You don't think any of that's
true? <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, right now a question is about to occur to Rory. And seeing
as the answer is about to change his life, I think you should give him
your full attention. <br>
RORY: Yeah. Actually, yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: There it is. <br>
RORY: Because what I don't get is, you blew up the Tardis, that stopped
that dream, but what stopped the Leadworth dream? <br>
AMY: We crashed the camper van. <br>
RORY: Oh, right. I don't remember that bit. <br>
AMY: No, you weren't there. You were already <br>
RORY: Already what? <br>
AMY: Dead. You died in that dream. Mrs Poggit got you. <br>
RORY: Okay. But how did you know it was a dream? Before you crashed the
van, how did you know you wouldn't just die? <br>
AMY: I didn't. <br>
RORY: Oh. <br>
AMY: Yeah. <br>
RORY: Oh. <br>
AMY: Yeah, oh. <br>
(Rory kisses Amy, then she kisses him back.) <br>
DOCTOR: So, well then, where now? Or should I just pop down to the
swimming pool for a few lengths? <br>
RORY: I don't know. Anywhere's good for me. I'm happy anywhere. It's up
to Amy this time. Amy's choice. </font> </p>
