Well, when I said&nbsp;afterlife, I was being a tiny bit poetic.
And
Nethersphere's just a cool name we come up with during a spit-ball.<br>
DANNY: What is this place?<br>
SEB:
Well, you have to think of it as a data cloud. You know, for storing

DANNY: We're in a cloud?<br>
SEB: A sort of cloud, yeah.<br>
DANNY: And what's happening to it?<br>

its face in wonderment. Finally it goes to the clipboard Graham has
left on the desk and rips off the top page, which has Known As Danny

(He kisses Missy gently.)<br>
DOCTOR: I really didn't know. I wasn't sure. You lose sight sometimes.
Thank you! I am <i>not</i>
a good man!&nbsp;I am not a bad man. I am not a hero. And I'm definitely
not a president. And no, I'm not an officer. Do you know what I am?
I&nbsp;am an idiot, with a box and a screwdriver. Just passing through,
helping out, learning. I don't need an army. I never have, because I've
got them. Always them. Because love, it's not an emotion. Love is a
promise. <br>
(Cyber-Danny puts his arm around Clara.)<br>
DOCTOR: And <i>he</i> will <i>never</i> hurt
her. P E, catch! &nbsp;<br>
(The control bracelet lands in Cyber-Danny's hand.)<br>

(He speaks into the bracelet.)<br>
CYBER-DANNY:
Attention! <br>(The Cyber-Army spring to attention.)<br>CYBER-DANNY: This is not a good day. This is Earth's darkest hour. And
look at you miserable lot. We are the Fallen. But today, we shall rise.
The army of the dead will save the land of the living. This is not the
order of a general, nor the whim of a lunatic.<br>
MISSY: Excuse me?<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CYBER-DANNY: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is
a promise. The promise of a soldier! (to Clara) You will sleep safe
tonight. <br>
(Cyber-Danny
ignites his rocket boots and rises from the ground. All the Cybermen do
the same. They fly off into the clouds and explode, burning them away
and letting the sunshine through. London, New York, the night sky at
Sydney clears in a roll of flame.)<br>
CLARA: Well. The clouds have all gone.<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, burned up. Totally burnt. Burnt to nothing. Sorry.<br>

To save her soul?&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But who,

(The
Doctor prepares to vaporise Missy, but another energy bolt gets there
first. It was a Cyberman with a dark chest disc. It points to something lying amongst the
gravestones.)<br>

CLARA: She is.<br>

course. The Earth's darkest hour and mine. Where else would you be? <br>
(The
Doctor salutes the spirit of Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge
Stewart. It acknowledges with a bow of its head then blasts off into
the wide blue yonder.) <br>

attention, and without kicking up any dust like it used to in the old
