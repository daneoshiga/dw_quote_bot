<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Deep below the Northern Polar icepack in 1983, a
Russian submarine is navigating by radar.) <br>
VOICE [OC]: Signal is genuine. Signal is genuine. Zero bravo. <br>
(The Captain and his Lieutenant put their keys into the missile firing
controls and two launch doors on the deck of the sub open.) <br>
ZHUKOV: Prepare to launch nuclear weapons. <br>
STEPASHIN: Aye, sir. <br>
VOICE [OC]: Moscow confirming launch sequence. <br>
ZHUKOV: The Firebird stands ready to serve. <br>
STEPASHIN: For the Motherland. <br>
ZHUKOV: For the Motherland. <br>
GRISENKO: (singing) This means nothing to me. This means nothing to me.
<br>
(An elderly civilian is singing along to music on his Walkman.) <br>
GRISENKO: Oh, Vienna. Have I interrupted something? <br>
ZHUKOV: We were about to blow up the world, Professor. <br>
GRISENKO: Again? Ultravox. I bloody love them. Got a friend who sends
me the tapes. <br>
ZHUKOV: This is the Captain. Drill abandoned. All hands, stand down.
Repeat, drill abandoned. <br>
STEPASHIN: With respect, sir, we must run it again. <br>
ZHUKOV: Tomorrow. <br>
STEPASHIN: Comrade Captain, the NATO exercises <br>
ZHUKOV: Sabre rattling. <br>
STEPASHIN: I don't think so. <br>
ZHUKOV: Oh, you don't think so? <br>
STEPASHIN: Sir, American aggression gets more intolerable by the day.
We must run the drill again. <br>
ZHUKOV: Tomorrow. <br>
(Stepashin leaves.) <br>
ZHUKOV: Did you have your specimen stowed okay? <br>
GRISENKO: Yeah. Piotr's looking after it. <br>
ZHUKOV: Well, at least we have something to show for our little hunting
expedition. What is it, a mammoth? <br>
GRISENKO: Probably. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Storage]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (But in the compartment below them, the dirty ice
contains an chunky upright biped, not a hairy quadruped. Piotr holds
out a flame to it.) <br>
PIOTR: What are you, milaya moya? Professor wants you thawed out back
in Moscow, but life's too short to wait. <br>
(Piotr lights a blowtorch and starts melting the block. The something
moves inside, then a big hand bursts out and grabs Piotr's throat.) <br>
PIOTR: Argh! Get away! <br>
(The freed Ice Warrior starts stomping through the submarine. Suddenly,
water flood into all compartments.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEPASHIN: Alarm! Alarm! Hold the bridge, port
side. <br>
ZHUKOV: Evasive manoeuvres! <br>
ONEGIN: Descending to two hundred metres. <br>
VOICE [OC]: We're under attack! <br>
ONEGIN: Two ten! <br>
ZHUKOV: Bring her up! Bring her up! <br>
ONEGIN: It's no good, sir. <br>
(Then the Tardis materialises and the Doctor steps out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Viva Las Vegas! <br>
(The boat shudders and he goes flying across the compartment along with
Clara, in an evening dress.) <br>
STEPASHIN: Stranger on the bridge! <br>
ZHUKOV: Who the hell are you? <br>
CLARA: Not Vegas, then. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, this is much better. <br>
CLARA: A sinking submarine? <br>
DOCTOR: A sinking Soviet submarine! <br>
STEPASHIN: Break out side arms. Restrain them! <br>
ONEGIN: Four ten. Four twenty. Turbines still not responding! <br>
ZHUKOV: They've got to. <br>
(The Doctor has the sonic screwdriver switched on.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Sideways momentum. You've still got sideways momentum! <br>
ZHUKOV: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Your propellers work independently of the main turbines. You
can't stop her going down but you can manoeuvre the sub laterally. Do
it! <br>
STEPASHIN: Get these people off the bridge now! <br>
CLARA: Just listen to him, for god's sake! <br>
DOCTOR: Geographical anomaly to starboard. Probably an underwater
ridge. <br>
ZHUKOV: How do you know this? <br>
DOCTOR: Look, we have just a chance to stop the descent if we settle on
it. Do it! <br>
ONEGIN: Six hundred metres. Sir, six ten! <br>
DOCTOR: Or this thing is going to implode. <br>
ZHUKOV: Lateral thrust to starboard, all propellers. <br>
ONEGIN: Sir? <br>
ZHUKOV: Now! <br>
STEPASHIN: You're going to let this madman give the orders? <br>
ZHUKOV: Lateral thrust! <br>
ONEGIN: Aye, sir! Six sixty, six eighty. <br>
(They hit the ridge just in time. Grey Lady Down.) <br>
ONEGIN: Descent arrested at seven hundred metres. <br>
ZHUKOV: It seems we owe you are lives, whoever you are. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll hold you to that. Might come in handy. <br>
STEPASHIN: Search them. Yes, I know. It's a woman. Now search them! <br>
CLARA: Are we going to be okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. <br>
CLARA: Is that a lie? <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly. Very dangerous time, Clara. East and West standing on
the brink of nuclear oblivion. <br>
(And the Doctor has a Barbie doll in a pocket. And a ball of string.) <br>
DOCTOR: Lots of itchy fingers on the button. <br>
CLARA: Isn't it always like that? <br>
DOCTOR: Sort of, but there are flash points and this is one. Hair,
shoulder pads, nukes. It's the Eighties. Everything's bigger. I would
like a receipt, please. <br>
(The sonic screwdriver is handed to Captain Zhukov.) <br>
ZHUKOV: What is this? <br>
(The submarine shakes, and Clara looses her footing.) <br>
DOCTOR: Clara! <br>
CLARA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Clara! <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! No, no, no, no, no, no. No, not now! <br>
(Clara falls over into the foot of water on the control room floor, and
sees the sonic screwdriver there. Then she passes out, and drifts in
and out again. Later, someone has put a uniform jacket on Clara. The
Doctor is being interrogated.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Captain, we didn't attack of your ship out here. Now we
need to get the pumps working to get her afloat. <br>
ZHUKOV [OC]: Yeah, we'll last till the rescue ship comes. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: If it comes. <br>
ZHUKOV [OC]: Oh, the sinking is just a coincidence, is it? Who are you?
<br>
(Clara wakes and stands.) <br>
DOCTOR: All right, Captain, all right. You know what? Just this once,
no dissembling, no psychic paper, no pretending to be an Earth
Ambassador. <br>
(See <a href="9-2.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
The Curse of Peladon</a>, folks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor, me and Clara, time travellers. Clara, you okay? <br>
CLARA: Think so. <br>
ZHUKOV: Time travellers? <br>
DOCTOR: We arrived here out of thin air. You just saw it happen. <br>
GRISENKO: I didn't. <br>
DOCTOR: Your problem, mate, not mine. <br>
CLARA: We were sinking. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
CLARA: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: We sank. <br>
CLARA: No, what happened to the Tardis, I mean. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind that. Listen. Captain, breath's precious down here.
Let's not waste it, eh? <br>
ZHUKOV: You're right. Maybe I can save a little oxygen by having you
both shot! <br>
CLARA: What does it matter how we arrived? The important thing is to
get <br>
(Something breathes very loudly.) <br>
CLARA: Out. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly! Number one priority, not suffocating. <br>
(Zhukov spots what everyone else is staring at, too, and releases the
Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? Ah. Oh, thank you. Finally seeing sense. Now, what sort of
state is the sub in? <br>
(The Ice Warrior is directly behind the Doctor.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What about the radio? Can we send a <br>
CLARA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: What! <br>
(Hiss.) <br>
DOCTOR: What is that? Gas? Could be gas. <br>
(Then he turns around and looks up at the Warrior.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. It never rains but it pours. <br>
GRISENKO: We were drilling for oil in the ice. I thought I'd found a
mammoth. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not a mammoth. <br>
GRISENKO: No. <br>
CLARA: What is it, then? <br>
DOCTOR: It's an Ice Warrior. A native of the planet Mars. And we go way
back. Way back. <br>
ZHUKOV: A Martian? You can't be serious. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm always serious. With days off. <br>
CLARA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Just keeping it light, Clara. They're scared. <br>
CLARA: They're scared? I'm scared. <br>
(Stepashin points his pistol at the Ice Warrior, who raises his weapon
arm and powers up.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no, no! Please, please. Wait, just. There is no
need for this. Just hear me out. You're confused, disorientated. Of
course you are. You've been lying dormant in the ice for, for, for how
long? How long, Professor? <br>
GRISENKO: By my reckoning, five thousand years. <br>
DOCTOR: Five thousand years? That's a hell of a nap. Can't blame you if
you've got out of the wrong side of bed. Look, nobody here wants to
hurt you. <br>
(He pushes Stepashin's gun down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Please, just. Why don't you tell us your name? <br>
ZHUKOV: What are you talking about? It has a name? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course it has a name. And a rank. This is a soldier, and it
deserves our respect. <br>
ZHUKOV: This is madness. That is a monster! <br>
SKALDAK: Skaldak. <br>
DOCTOR: What did you say? <br>
SKALDAK: I am Grand Marshal Skaldak. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. <br>
(Then electricity plays over Skaldak's wet armour. He roars before
collapsing. Stepashin has used a cattle prod on him from behind.) <br>
DOCTOR: You idiot! You idiot. Grand Marshal Skaldak. <br>
CLARA: You know him. <br>
DOCTOR: Sovereign of the Tharsisian caste. Vanquisher of the Phobos
Heresy. The greatest hero the proud Martian race has ever produced. <br>
ZHUKOV: So what do we do now? <br>
DOCTOR: Lock him up. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Skaldak wakes as he is being chained to the
girders holding the torpedoes.) <br>
SKALDAK: Is it true? <br>
ONEGIN: Er, true? <br>
SKALDAK: I slept for five thousand years? <br>
ONEGIN: Er, that's what the professor says. <br>
SKALDAK: Five thousand years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Captain's cabin]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: The Ice Warriors have a different creed,
Clara. A different code. By his own standards, Skaldak is a hero. It
was said his enemies honoured him so much, they'd carve his name into
their own flesh before they died. <br>
CLARA: Oh, yeah. Very nice. He sounds lovely. <br>
ZHUKOV: An Ice Warrior? Explain. <br>
DOCTOR: There isn't time. <br>
ZHUKOV: Try me. <br>
DOCTOR: Martian reptile know as the Ice Warrior. When Mars turned cold
they had to adapt. They're bio-mechaniod. Cyborgs. Built themselves
survival armour so they could exist in the freezing cold of their home
world, but a sudden increase in temperature and the armour goes
haywire. <br>
CLARA: Like with the cattle prod thing. <br>
DOCTOR: Like with the cattle prod thing. Bit of a design flaw. To be
honest, I've always wondered why they never sorted it. Oh look, you've
got me telling you about them and I said there wasn't time. <br>
CLARA: Is he that dangerous? <br>
DOCTOR: This one is. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Professor Grisenko puts his headphones back on.) <br>
STEPASHIN: Why are we listening to this nonsense, Captain? These people
are clearly enemy agents. <br>
CLARA: Huh? <br>
STEPASHIN: Spies, Captain. <br>
CLARA: Pretty bad spies, mate. I don't even speak Russian. <br>
STEPASHIN: What? <br>
CLARA: I don't. (sotto, to the Doctor) Am I speaking Russian? How come
I'm speaking Russian? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Now? We have to do this now? <br>
CLARA: (sotto) Are they speaking Russian? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Seriously? Now? It's the Tardis translation matrix. <br>
STEPASHIN: In my opinion, Comrade Captain, this creature is a Western
weapon. <br>
CLARA: (sotto) Are they? <br>
DOCTOR (sotto) Yes, they're Russians. <br>
ZHUKOV: A weapon? <br>
STEPASHIN: Survival suit. What is the alternative? The little green man
from Mars? <br>
GRISENKO: Correction. It's a big green man from Mars. <br>
STEPASHIN: I don't appreciate your levity, Professor. <br>
GRISENKO: Why does that not surprise me? Maybe they're telling the
truth. <br>
STEPASHIN: The truth? <br>
GRISENKO: Yes, a revolutionary concept, I know. <br>
STEPASHIN: It's essential that we inform Moscow of what we have found. <br>
ZHUKOV: The radio's out of action, in case you hadn't noticed,
Stepashin. <br>
STEPASHIN: They have our last position. They will find us. When they do
<br>
ZHUKOV: Yes? <br>
STEPASHIN: Well, the Cold War won't stay cold for ever, Captain. <br>
ZHUKOV: For God's sake, Stepashin, you're like a stuck record. We have
other priorities right now. I want you back on repairs immediately. We
need to keep this ship alive. Dismissed. <br>
STEPASHIN: Sir? <br>
ZHUKOV: Dismissed, Stepashin. <br>
(Stepashin leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: All we needed to do was let Skaldak go and he'd have forgotten
us. But you attacked him. You declared war. Harm one of us and you harm
us all. That's the ancient Martian code. <br>
(Beeping from Grisenko's headphones.) <br>
DOCTOR: You hear that? Skaldak has sent out a distress call. He will
bring down the fires of hell just for laying a glove on him. <br>
ZHUKOV: Unless you talk to it? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the only one who can. <br>
ZHUKOV: No. Out of the question. We're not losing you. I'll do it. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ZHUKOV: You can talk to it through me. <br>
DOCTOR: Skaldak won't talk to you. You're an enemy soldier. <br>
ZHUKOV: And how would he know that? <br>
DOCTOR: A soldier knows another soldier. He'll smell it on you. Smell
it on you a mile off. <br>
ZHUKOV: And he wouldn't smell it on you, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Just let me in there before it's too late. It can't be you or
any of your men. <br>
ZHUKOV: Well, it can't be you. <br>
CLARA: Ahem. Well, there really is only one choice, isn't there. I
don't smell of anything, to my knowledge. <br>
DOCTOR: You? No! No! No way. You're not going in there alone, Clara.
Absolutely not. No, no. Never. </font></p>

DOCTOR: You were great, yeah. <br>
CLARA: Really? <br>
DOCTOR: Really. <br>
GRISENKO: Doctor? The signal. It's stopped. <br>
DOCTOR: Skaldak got no answer from his Martian brothers. Now he's given
up hope. <br>
ZHUKOV: Hope of what? <br>
DOCTOR: Being rescued. He thinks he's been abandoned. He's got nothing
left to lose. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Passageway]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (As the ledge below the submarine slowly crumbles
under its weight.) <br>
ZHUKOV: But what can he do, stuck down here like the rest of us? How
bad can it be? <br>
DOCTOR: This sub's stuffed with nuclear missiles, Zhukov. It's fat with
them. What do you think Skaldak's going to do when he finds that out?
How bad can it be? How bad can it be? It couldn't be any worse. <br>
(Some tumbling rocks hit the submarine and water pours through a hatch.
It gets closed quickly.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Spoke to soon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Turbine room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEPASHIN: Hello? Who's there? Who's there? Who's
there! <br>
(Something is moving behind the pipes. Then a pair of slender, three
fingered hands reach out for his head from behind.) <br>
STEPASHIN: What do you want with me? <br>
SKALDAK: Much. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ZHUKOV: Comrades, you know our situation. The
reactor is drowned. We are totally reliant on battery power and our air
is running out. Rescue is unlikely, but we still have a mission to
fulfil. If the Doctor is right, then we are all that stands between
this creature and the destruction of the world. Control of one missile
is all he needs. We are expendable, comrades. Our world is not. I know
I can rely on every one of you to do his duty without fail. That is
all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Turbine room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEPASHIN: Listen to me. We both understand each
other. This, this mewling time of peace, it doesn't suit us. We are
both warriors, and together we can form an alliance. <br>
SKALDAK: An alliance? <br>
STEPASHIN: Yes. To win the Cold War. <br>
SKALDAK: Cold War? <br>
STEPASHIN: Both sides are capable of completely obliterating the other.
It's a state we call mutually assured destruction. <br>
SKALDAK: Mutually assured destruction. But this has not occured. <br>
STEPASHIN: No. <br>
SKALDAK: Not yet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CLARA: Even if a missile did get launched, that
wouldn't be it, would it? <br>
DOCTOR: It? <br>
CLARA: End of the world. Game over. I mean, what if they fired one by
accident. What would happen then? <br>
DOCTOR: I told you, Clara. Earth is like a storm waiting to break,
right now. Both sides baring their teeth, talking up war. It would only
take one tiny spark. <br>
CLARA: Yeah, but the world didn't end in 1983, did it, or I wouldn't be
here. <br>
DOCTOR: New. History's in flux. It can be changed. Re-written. <br>
(The crew are all armed with rifles.) <br>
DOCTOR: How many of us are left? <br>
ZHUKOV: Twelve. And we can't find Stepashin. <br>
DOCTOR: We split up and comb this sub. One team stays here to guard the
bridge. <br>
ZHUKOV: That's it? That's the plan? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's either that or we stay here and wait for him to kill
us. <br>
ZHUKOV: Okay. <br>
CLARA: Is it true you've never seen one outside of its shell suit? <br>
DOCTOR: Shell suit? Clara! For an Ice Warrior to leave its armour is
the gravest dishonour. Skaldak is desperate. He is deadly and we have
got to find him. <br>
GRISENKO: Will this help? <br>
(The sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! You saved it. <br>
GRISENKO: No, no, it was on the floor with this. <br>
(The Barbie doll. The Doctor kisses it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Professor, I could kiss you. <br>
GRISENKO: If you insist. <br>
DOCTOR: Later. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CLARA: So, why have you got a cattle prod on a
submarine? <br>
GRISENKO: Polar bears. <br>
CLARA: Ah, right. <br>
GRISENKO: We run across them when we're drilling. Can be quite nasty,
you know. <br>
CLARA: I'd swap one for an Ice Warrior any day. Cuddlier. <br>
GRISENKO: Courage, my dear. I always sing a song. <br>
CLARA: What? <br>
GRISENKO: To keep my spirits up. <br>
CLARA: Yeah, that would work, if this was Pinocchio. <br>
(The Doctor seems to have set off some alarms.) <br>
GRISENKO: Do you know Hungry Like The Wolf? <br>
CLARA: What? <br>
GRISENKO: Duran Duran. One of my favourites. Come on. <br>
CLARA: I'm not singing a song. <br>
(The Doctor gets a hatch open and puts his head inside. They hear an
echoing growl.) <br>
CLARA: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Pressure. Just pressure. We're seven hundred metres down,
remember? <br>
GRISENKO: Don't worry about it. Think of something else. <br>
(He sings the opening phrase of his song.) <br>
GRISENKO: I am hungry like the wolf. <br>
CLARA: I'm not singing. <br>
GRISENKO: Don't you know it? <br>
CLARA: Course I know it. We do it at karaoke, the odd hen night. <br>
GRISENKO: Karaoke? Hen night? You speak excellent Russian, my dear, but
sometimes I don't understand a word you're talking about. </font></p>

BELEVICH: If we get out of here. <br>
ONEGIN: The first people in the world to discover a genuine, living <br>

(Which reaches down and lifts the hapless helmsman up by his head.) <br>
BELEVICH: I don't know. You hear stories, don't you. Stories about the
things the Kremlin doesn't want us to <br>
(Then he realises he is alone.) <br>
BELEVICH: Onegin? Onegin! <br>
(The Doctor, Clara and Grisenko hear the growls and screams, and run
towards them. We only see a stiff arm and hand sticking up.) <br>
GRISENKO: Good God. Torn apart. It's a monster, a savage. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Professor. Not savage. Forensic. Well, he's dismantled
them. Skaldak's learning. Learning all about you. Your strengths, your
weaknesses. Come on. <br>
(They go down a passageway.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stay here. <br>
CLARA: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: Stay here. Don't argue. <br>
CLARA: I'm not. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Good. <br>
(He goes up a ladder.) <br>
GRISENKO: Oh, it's a young man's game, all this dashing about. Clara,
what is it? <br>
CLARA: I was doing okay. I mean, I went in there and I did the scary
stuff, didn't I? I went in there with the Ice Warrior and it went okay.
Actually, it went just about as badly as it could have done but that
wasn't my fault. <br>
GRISENKO: Not at all. <br>
CLARA: So I'm happy about that. <br>
GRISENKO: Yes. <br>
CLARA: Chuffed. <br>
GRISENKO: And so you should be. So what's the matter? <br>
CLARA: Seeing those bodies back there. It's all got very real. Are we
going to make it? <br>
GRISENKO: Yes, of course. <br>
(Elsewhere, there is a growl and something flashes past a grating.) <br>
ZHUKOV: It's in the walls. <br>
(Meanwhile, the Doctor finds a body.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Stepashin. <br>
(The Doctor hears running feet above him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, oh. Fast. He's fast. <br>
(And, with more creaking and growling -) <br>
CLARA: What was that? <br>
GRISENKO: The Doctor told you, it's just the boat settling. Tell me
about yourself. What do you like doing? Clara? Clara? <br>
CLARA: Stuff. You know, stuff. <br>
GRISENKO: Stuff. Very enlightening. And the Doctor, what he said. Is it
true you're from another time? From our future? Clara? <br>
CLARA: Yes. <br>
GRISENKO: Tell me what happens. <br>
CLARA: I can't. <br>
GRISENKO: Well, I need to know. <br>
CLARA: I'm not allowed. <br>
GRISENKO: No, please. <br>
CLARA: I can't! <br>
GRISENKO: Ultravox, do they split up? <br>
(Clara laughs.) <br>
CLARA: Funny. You're funny. <br>
(Then Skaldak grabs her head from above.) <br>
GRISENKO: Let her go! <br>
(Grisenko shoots and Skaldak retreats.) <br>
GRISENKO: See? I don't just like Western music <br>
(Skaldak grabs Grisenko as the Doctor runs up.) <br>
CLARA: No, please don't hurt him. Please! <br>
SKALDAK: You attacked me. Martian law decrees that the people of this
planet are forfeit. I now have all the information I require. It will
take only one missile to begin the process. To end this Cold War. <br>
DOCTOR: Grand Marshal, there is no need for this. Listen to me. <br>
SKALDAK: My distress call has not been answered. It will never be
answered. My people are dead. They are dust. There is nothing left for
me except my revenge. <br>
(The armour in the torpedo room activates.) <br>
DOCTOR: There is something left for you, Skaldak. Mercy. <br>
SKALDAK: Mercy? <br>
ZHUKOV: You must wear that armour for a reason, my friend. Let's see,
shall we? <br>
DOCTOR: No, Captain, wait! <br>
ZHUKOV: I will do whatever it takes to defend my world, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, great, fine, good, but we are getting somewhere here. We
are negotiating. Jaw-jaw not war-war. <br>
GRISENKO: Churchill? <br>
DOCTOR: Churchill. <br>
ZHUKOV: Very well, we'll negotiate, but from a position of strength. <br>
SKALDAK: Excellent tactical thinking. My congratulations, Captain. <br>
ZHUKOV: Thank you. <br>
SKALDAK: Unfortunately, your position is not, perhaps, as strong as you
might hope. <br>
(We have been getting glimpses of Skaldak in the dark. Red glowing
eyes, lipless mouth, all copyright H G Wells, in my opinion.) <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
(Enter the armour, which has broken its shackles. Skaldak releases
Grisenko and drops into it.) <br>
DOCTOR: He summoned the armour. <br>
CLARA: How did it do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Sonic tech, Clara. The song of the Ice Warrior. <br>
(A submariner empties his rifle at the back of the armour.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
SKALDAK: My world is dead but now there will be a second red planet.
Red with the blood of humanity! <br>
DOCTOR: Skaldak! Skaldak, wait! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Skaldak plugs himself into the computer and the
launch key locks turn. A missile spins up.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! Skaldak, wait! Wait, wait. <br>
ZHUKOV: He's arming the warheads. <br>
DOCTOR: Where is the honour in condemning billions of innocents to
death? Five thousand years ago Mars was the centre of a vast empire.
The jewel of this solar system. The people of Earth had only just begun
to leave their caves. Five thousand years isn't such a long time.
They're still just frightened children, still primitive. Who are you to
judge them? <br>
(Skaldak unplugs himself.) <br>
SKALDAK: I am Skaldak! This planet is forfeit under Martian law. <br>
DOCTOR: Then teach them. Teach them, Grand Marshal. Show them another
way. Show them there is honour in mercy. Is this how you want history
to remember you? Grand Marshal Skaldak, Destroyer of Earth. Because
that's what you'll be if you send those missiles. Not a soldier, a
murderer. Five billion lives extinguished. No chance for goodbyes. A
world snuffed out like a candle flame! All right. All right, Skaldak,
you leave me no choice. I'm a Time Lord, Skaldak. I know a thing or two
about sonic technology myself. <br>
SKALDAK: A threat? You threaten me, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, not you, all of us. I will blow this sub up before you
can even reach that button, Grand Marshal. Blow us all to oblivion. <br>
SKALDAK: You would sacrifice yourself? <br>
DOCTOR: In a heartbeat. <br>
SKALDAK: Mutually assured destruction. <br>
DOCTOR: Look into my eyes, Skaldak. Look into my eyes and tell me
you're capable of doing this. Huh? Can you do that? Dare you do that?
Look into my eyes, Skaldak. Come on. Face to face. <br>
SKALDAK: Well, Doctor. <br>
(The helmet tilts back to reveal the Martian lizard with its lidless
eyes.) <br>
SKALDAK: Which of us shall blink first? <br>
CLARA: Why did you hesitate? Back there, in the dark. You were going to
kill this man, remember? I begged you not to, and you listened. Why
show compassion then, Skaldak, and not now? The Doctor's right.
Billions will die. Mothers, sons, fathers, daughters. Remember that
last battle, Skaldak? Your daughter. You sang the songs. <br>
SKALDAK: Of the Red Snows. <br>
(The submarine shifts.) <br>
CLARA: What's happening? <br>
(A tractor beam has grabbed them.) <br>
SKALDAK: My people live. They have come for me! <br>
ZHUKOV: We're rising. We're rising! <br>
GRISENKO: Six hundred metres. Five fifty. <br>
(The conning tower breaks through the ice.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've surfaced. Your people have saved us. <br>
SKALDAK: Saved me, not you. <br>
DOCTOR: Just go, Skaldak, please. Please, go in peace. <br>
(Skaldak is teleported away.) <br>
CLARA: We did it. We did it! <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, no. It's still armed. A single pulse from
that ship. I'll destroy us if I have to. I will destroy us if I have
to. Show mercy, Skaldak. Come on. Show mercy. <br>
CLARA: (sings) I'm lost and I'm found, and I'm hungry like the wolf. <br>
(The nuclear trigger disarms and the silos close. The Doctor turns off
his sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now we're safe. <br>
(Clara hugs him for a long moment.) <br>
CLARA: Ahem. Saved the world, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
CLARA: That's what we do. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Conning tower]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They look up at the Martian spaceship.) <br>
CLARA: The Tardis! Where's the Tardis? You never explained. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, don't worry about that. <br>
CLARA: Stop saying that. Where is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Well, I wasn't to know, was I? <br>
CLARA: Know what? <br>
DOCTOR: I've been tinkering, breaking her in. I'm allowed. <br>
CLARA: What did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) I reset the HADS. <br>
CLARA: Huh? <br>
DOCTOR: I reset the HADS. <br>
CLARA: The what? <br>
DOCTOR: The HADS. The Hostile Action Displacement System. If the Tardis
comes under attack, gunfire, time winds, the sea, it relocates. <br>
CLARA: Oh, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't used it in donkey's years. It seemed like a good idea
at the time. Well, never mind, it's bound to turn up somewhere. <br>
(His sonic screwdriver starts whirring.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo. Ha, see? Right on cue. Brilliant. <br>
CLARA: Brilliant. <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis is at the pole. <br>
CLARA: Not far, then. <br>
DOCTOR: The south pole. <br>
CLARA: Ah. <br>
DOCTOR: Could we have a lift? <br>

away.)&nbsp;</font> </p>
