</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The new Doctor dashes to the console and flicks a
few switches, checking the monitor.) <br>
DOCTOR: 6 PM... Tuesday... <br>
(Rose watches, half concealed by a pillar. The Doctor turns a knob.) <br>
DOCTOR: October... 5006... On the way to Barcelona! <br>
(Straightens up and faces Rose, grinning as if extremely pleased with
himself). <br>
DOCTOR: Now then... what do I look like? <br>
(Gives her no chance to reply before holding up a hand to silence her) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no no, no no no no no no no. No. Don't tell me. <br>
(Rose looks completely bemused.) <br>
DOCTOR: Let's see... two legs, two arms, two hands... <br>
(Tests his wrist, circling it). <br>
DOCTOR: Slight weakness in the dorsal tubercle. <br>
(Hands fly to his head). <br>
DOCTOR: Hair! I'm not bald! <br>
(Rose now looks shocked. The Doctor runs his hands through his hair
gleefully.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Oh! Big hair! <br>
(Feels his sideburns, looks and sounds delighted) <br>
DOCTOR: Sideburns, I've got sideburns! Or really bad skin. Little bit
thinner... <br>
(Slaps his stomach). <br>
DOCTOR: That's weird. Give me time, I'll get used to it. <br>
(With the air of someone making a most wonderful discovery) <br>
DOCTOR: I... have got... a mole. I can feel it. <br>
(Rose is breathing heavily. She looks scared. The Doctor seems not to
notice.) <br>
DOCTOR: Between my shoulder blades, there's a mole. <br>
(Rotates his shoulders). <br>
DOCTOR: That's all right. Love the mole. <br>
(Grins at Rose). <br>
DOCTOR: Go on then, tell me. <br>
(Stands straight up before Rose, ready for assessment. His hair is all
ruffled) <br>
DOCTOR: What do you think? <br>
ROSE (quietly, timidly): Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR (crestfallen, slightly surprised): I'm the Doctor. <br>
ROSE (shakes her head, not believing him): No... Where is he? Where's
the Doctor? (Voice rising). What have you done to him? <br>
DOCTOR: You saw me, I, I changed... (Indicates over his shoulder, the
spot where he regenerated) ... right in front of you. <br>
ROSE: I saw him sort of explode, and then you replaced him, like a... a
teleport or a transmat or a body swap or something. <br>
(The Doctor does not interject. He seems lost for words. Rose takes a
few steps towards him. At arm’s length, she pushes him in the chest.) <br>
ROSE : You're not fooling me. <br>
(The Doctor rocks back on his heels as though he cannot believe what he
is hearing.) <br>
ROSE : I've seen all sorts of things. Nano genes... Gelth... (Looks
darkly at him). Slitheen... <br>
(The Doctor raises his eyebrows.) <br>
ROSE : Oh, my God, are you a Slitheen? <br>
DOCTOR: (calmly): I'm not a Slitheen. <br>
ROSE (voice rising to a shout): Send him back. I'm warning you; send
the Doctor back right now! <br>
DOCTOR (pleadingly): Rose, it's me. <br>
(He leans forward in his urgency to make her believe him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Honestly, it's me. <br>
(Rose stares at him, her chest rising and falling very fast.) <br>
DOCTOR: I was dying. To save my own life I changed my body. Every
single cell, but... it's still me. <br>
ROSE (whispers): You can't be. <br>
(The Doctor takes a few steps closer to her, looking straight down into
her eyes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Then how could I remember this? Very first word I ever said to
you. Trapped in that cellar. Surrounded by shop window dummies....
oh... <br>
(Looks away for a moment, reminiscing. Then he looks back into her
eyes) ... <br>
DOCTOR: such a long time ago. I took your hand... <br>
(To emphasize this point, he takes her hand... just like he did when
Rose first asked who he was. Rose glances briefly down at their joint
hands and then back up at his face.) <br>
DOCTOR: I said one word... just one word, I said... "Run". <br>
(He gazes at her. Rose looks into his eyes, her own full of tears.) <br>
ROSE: (whispers): Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor grins.) <br>
DOCTOR (gently): Hello. <br>
(Rose sighs in an almost exasperated fashion and stumbles backwards as
the impact of what has just happened hits her. The Doctor takes off
around the other side of the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: And we never stopped, did we? All across the universe. Running,
running, running... <br>
(Flicks a few switches on the console). <br>
DOCTOR: One time we had to hop. Do you remember? Hopping for our lives.
<br>
(He hops madly up and down on the spot. Rose has her back against the
pillar and is just watching him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah? All that hopping? Remember hopping for your life? Yeah?!
Hop? With the... <br>
(The wild enthusiasm ebbs from his voice at Rose's lack of reaction.
His hopping subsides) <br>
DOCTOR: No? <br>
ROSE: Can you change back? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you want me to? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
ROSE: Can you? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
(He seems rather disappointed. He glances briefly down at the floor) <br>
DOCTOR: Do you want to leave? <br>
ROSE (shocked): Do you want me to leave? <br>
DOCTOR (quickly): No! But... your choice... if you want to go home... <br>
(Rose still looks upset. He goes to the console again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Cancel Barcelona. Change to... London... the Powell Estate...
ah... let's say the 24th of December. (Looks at her). Consider it a
Christmas present. <br>
(Rose is edging slowly closer the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. <br>
(He steps back, his arms tucked under his armpits in an almost
defensive manner. Rose looks at him, then back at the console. The
TARDIS shudders as it changes direction.) <br>
ROSE: I'm going home? <br>
DOCTOR: Up to you. Back to your mum... it's all waiting. Fish and
chips, sausage and mash, beans on toast... no, Christmas! Turkey!
Although... having met your mother... nut loaf would be more
appropriate. <br>
(Rose looks down quickly, to hide a smile.) <br>
DOCTOR: Was that a smile? <br>
ROSE: No. <br>
DOCTOR (knowingly): That was a smile... <br>
ROSE: No it wasn't. <br>
DOCTOR (teasingly): You smiled... <br>
ROSE: No I didn't. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, all I did was change, I didn't... <br>
(He suddenly gags as the TARDIS shudders. Rose looks at him
questioningly.) <br>
ROSE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I said I didn't... <br>
(The same thing happens again, more violently. He makes nasty retching
noises.) <br>
DOCTOR: Uh oh. <br>
(Rose edges cautiously around the console.) <br>
ROSE: Er... is you alright? <br>
(A piece golden time vortex issues from the Doctor's mouth.) <br>
ROSE : What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh... the change is going a bit wrong and all. <br>
(He gags again. He falls to his knees, his face contorted.) <br>
ROSE: Look... maybe we should go back. Let's go and find Captain Jack,
he'd know what to do. <br>
DOCTOR (impatiently): Gah, he's busy! He's got plenty to do rebuilding
the Earth! <br>
(A lever on the console suddenly catches his eye). <br>
DOCTOR: I haven't used this one in years. <br>
(He flicks it. The TARDIS shudders violently and they are both nearly
knocked to their feet.) <br>
ROSE: What're you doing?! <br>
DOCTOR (crazily): Putting on a bit of speed! That's it! <br>
(He turns more knobs while Rose tries to maintain a more secure grip on
the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: My beautiful ship! Come on, faster! That's a girl! <br>
(Rose looks distinctly alarmed. The Doctor looks and sounds violent,
crazed.) <br>
DOCTOR: Faster! Wanna to break the time limit?! <br>
ROSE: (angry and scared): Stop it! <br>
DOCTOR (slightly nastily and still crazed): Ah, don't be so dull...
let's have a bit of fun! Let's rip through that vortex! <br>
(Catches her eye for a moment. His voice calms for a moment) <br>
DOCTOR: The regeneration's going wrong. I can't stop myself. (Grimaces
in pain). Ah, my head... <br>
(He violently springs up into standing position again, and his voice
has gone back to being crazed.) <br>
DOCTOR: Faster! Let's open those engines! <br>
(A bell rings.) <br>
ROSE: (looking around, frightened): What's that? <br>
(The Doctor's face appears next to her.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sounding delighted): We're gonna crash land! <br>
(He laughs manically.) <br>
ROSE: (shouting over the sound of the bell): Well then, do something! <br>
DOCTOR: (voice rising hysterically): Too late! Out of control! (Runs
around the console, giggling). Oh, I love it! Hot dawg! <br>
(He hops in the air excitedly.) <br>
ROSE: You're gonna kill us! <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on tight, here we go! <br>
(Their eyes meet across the console, the Doctor grinning madly, Rose
looking scared.) <br>
DOCTOR: Christmas Eve...!</font> </p>
