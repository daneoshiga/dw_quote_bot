over a bright pink suit walks along the street and sits on a metal
bench. She looks sad. A man in coat and hat observes her from round a
corner, then attracts her attention.) <br>
SILAS: Psst! Do you want to talk about it? <br>
DAPHNE: I don't talk to strangers. <br>
SILAS: Perhaps I can help. <br>
DAPHNE: I didn't ask for any help. <br>
(He goes over to her.) <br>
SILAS: We both know you can't sit there like that. It's dangerous. <br>
DAPHNE: It's too late. I don't care anymore. Let them find me. <br>
SILAS: You don't have to face your suffering alone, you know. <br>
DAPHNE: What do you mean? <br>
(He sits next to her.) <br>
SILAS: There's a place, a secret place, where some of us go to indulge
our depressions, to share our miseries, with other killjoys like you
and me. <br>
DAPHNE: I'm not a killjoy. <br>
SILAS: That's what they would call you. You interested? <br>
DAPHNE: Perhaps. <br>
SILAS: Oh, it changed my life. Look, here's my card. Go on, take it. <br>

DAPHNE: Silas P. <br>
SILAS: Other side. <br>
DAPHNE: But it says <br>
SILAS: Happiness Patrol, Undercover. <br>
(He blows a whistle.) <br>
SILAS: Time to get really depressed. <br>
(A group of women in beige mini-tunics, wearing white makeup and coral
coloured wigs come from the other direction. They are carrying very
large weapons and their leader has a purple pony tail.) <br>
DAISY: Have a nice death. <br>

one in the London Underground once. <br>
ACE: And a tyrannosaurus rex? <br>
DOCTOR: Met quite a few actually. <br>
ACE: Wicked. And pterodactyls? <br>
DOCTOR: Lots of pterodactyls. <br>

DOCTOR: Perhaps we should make a little visit sometime. <br>
ACE: What, to the Earth during the Upper Cretaceous? <br>
DOCTOR: A very good time for dinosaurs. <br>

Professor, anyway? <br>

ACE: No. <br>

TREVOR: You're right, I didn't give it, but then, I don't have to. I'm
on official business from Galactic Centre. <br>

ACE: Why, what is the prize? <br>
HAROLD: You're about to find out. <br>
(An image appears on the machine.) <br>
HELEN [on screen]: Congratulations and well played. Here is your prize
joke. Did you hear about the killjoy who won an outing with the
Happiness Patrol? He was tickled to death! Enjoy yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: I see what you mean. The delivery's terrible. <br>
HAROLD: The joke's not much good either. <br>
DOCTOR: You're right. It's awful. It's tasteless, smug, and worst of
all, it's badly constructed, I mean, who writes that stuff? <br>
HAROLD: I wrote it. <br>
ACE: You wrote it? <br>
HAROLD: I used to be her gag writer, when I was Harold F. Then my
brother disappeared. I went to look for him. I heard of other
disappearances. They caught me in the rocket port zone, trying to
contact Terra Omega, and brought put me here where I was regraded to
Harold V. <br>

PRISCILLA: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: Is this a prison? <br>
PRISCILLA: A prison? Of course not! This is the Waiting Zone. There
aren't any prisons on Terra Alpha. Miserable places. <br>
DOCTOR: So there's absolutely no chance whatsoever that this could be a
place of incarceration, and we're free to leave at any time. <br>
PRISCILLA: Well, yes and no. This isn't a prison, but cross that line
and you're a dead man. <br>

punishes anyone for wearing dark clothes? <br>

SILAS: Then I'd cross him off fast, if I were you. He's Helen A's
henchman. Does all her dirty work. There are small pockets of
resistance, though. Quiet murmurings of rebellion. Are you interested? <br>

Fondant Surprise to somewhere other than the Execution yard, whilst
their fellows sample the various pans bubbling on the stove.) <br>

HELEN: He must still be in the Kandy Kitchen. <br>
DAISY: I've already tried there. <br>
HELEN: Try it again. <br>
(The wall screen switches to a view of the empty kitchen.) <br>
HELEN: I wonder where he can be? </font></p>

the metal chute.) <br>
JOSEPH: Close to the Kandyman, were you? <br>
GILBERT: I made him. <br>
JOSEPH: Really? How very interesting. <br>
GILBERT: Only his body. His mind was very much his own. <br>
JOSEPH: I certainly don't recall the chap ever arriving. <br>
GILBERT: He was born in the Kandy Kitchen. <br>
JOSEPH: Whereas you came from Vasilip, if memory serves. <br>
GILBERT: I was exiled from Vasilip. I brought his bones here in a
suitcase. <br>
JOSEPH: Exiled, you say? <br>
GILBERT: I made a mistake. I was working in the state laboratories.
Without realising it, I invented a deadly new germ. The disease wiped
out nearly half the population. <br>
JOSEPH: Still, hardly your fault. Can't you just pack him up and start
again? <br>
GILBERT: Not this time. He's better off this way. The Kandyman's gone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Helen A's home]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DAISY: Will you be away long? <br>
HELEN: Away? <br>
DAISY: You're packing a case. I assume <br>
HELEN: Why should I be going away? <br>
DAISY: I just thought. The situation here. <br>
HELEN: There's nothing wrong, is there, Daisy K? <br>
DAISY: No, of course not. Everything's fine. <br>
TANNOY: Happiness will prevail. One hundred and twelve factories have
now fallen to the rebels as they continue their drive westwards. <br>
HELEN: As you said, Daisy K. Everything's fine. I'm happy. <br>
DAISY: I'm glad you're happy. <br>
(Helen goes into her office with her small metal suitcase and calls up
a computer status on the wall screen. Escape shuttle ready for take
off.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ACE: Are we under the palace now? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, this is where we get in. <br>
(The Doctor pushes open a manhole cover.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, Wences, this is the point at which we must say goodbye. <br>
WULFRIC: Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: No protests. Soon you'll be back in the sugar fields. <br>
(Rumble.) <br>
ACE: Something's taking off. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It sounds like a shuttle. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The wallscreen says Shuttle in orbit, but Helen
is not on it. Then, Receiving incoming communication.) <br>
HELEN: Gilbert M! <br>
GILBERT [on screen]: It's all working quite beautifully, Helen A, as
you can see. A masterful piece of engineering, even though I say so
myself. <br>
HELEN: You betrayed me! <br>
GILBERT [on screen]: My only complaint is the company. I don't know how
you put up with it. <br>
HELEN: How did you get into my escape shuttle? <br>
GILBERT [on screen]: That's what I was saying. The captain let me in. <br>
HELEN: Who is this captain? Let me see him. <br>
JOSEPH [on screen]: Goodbye, dear. <br>
HELEN: What are you doing there? You're supposed to be waiting for
Fifi. <br>
JOSEPH [on screen]: Really, dear? It must have slipped my mind. <br>
(The shuttle leaves orbit. <br>
A short while later, the Doctor walks in to see Daisy pointing a
handgun at him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, I was looking for Helen A. Perhaps you could tell her <br>
DAISY: You're too late, Doctor. She's gone. But I'm delighted to see
you. <br>
(Susan shoots Daisy's gun out of her hand, then enters, followed by
Earl.) <br>
DOCTOR: Susan Q. Who taught you to shoot like that? <br>
SUSAN: She did. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, Daisy K. <br>
ACE: You all right, Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: Splendid. <br>
ACE: Hello, faceache. <br>
(While Helen makes her way carefully through the dark, quiet streets,
Daisy is stripped of her wig, gagged and tied to a chair. Susan is
pulling tape from a machine.) <br>
SUSAN: Yeah, no more lift music. <br>
EARL: Unless it sounds like this. <br>
(Earl plays his harmonica into the broadcast system.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor steps out of a shadow.) <br>
DOCTOR: You can't get away, Helen A. <br>
HELEN: There's a scheduled flight in an hour. You can't stop me,
Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I know I can't, but it's not me you're running away from. <br>
HELEN: Who is it, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Yourself. That's why you'll never escape. <br>
HELEN: They didn't understand me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, they understood you only too well. That's why they resisted
you. <br>
HELEN: I only wanted the best for them. <br>
DOCTOR: The best? Prisons? Death squads? Executions? <br>
HELEN: They only came later. I told them to be happy, but they wouldn't
listen. I gave them every chance. Oh, I know they laughed sometimes,
but they still cried, they still wept. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you ever feel like weeping, Helen A? <br>
HELEN: Of course not, Doctor. It's unnecessary, and those that
persisted had to be punished. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
HELEN: For the good of the majority. For the ones that wanted to be
happy, who wanted to take the opportunities that I gave them. <br>
DOCTOR: What were these opportunities you gave them? A bag of sweets? A
few tawdry party games? Bland, soulless music? Do these things make you
happy? Of course they don't. Because they're cosmetic. Happiness is
nothing unless it exists side by side with sadness. <br>
(The Doctor produces a coin from the air.) <br>
DOCTOR: Two sides, one coin. <br>
HELEN: You can keep your coin, Doctor, and your sadness. I'll go
somewhere else. I'll find somewhere where there is no sadness. A place
where people know how to enjoy themselves. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sure you will, Helen A. <br>
HELEN: A place where people are strong, where they hold back the tears.
A place where people pull themselves together. <br>
DOCTOR: Where there is no compassion. <br>
HELEN: Where there is control. <br>
DOCTOR: A place where there is no love. <br>
HELEN: I always thought love was overrated. <br>
(Then she sees her beloved pet lying on a manhole cover, dying.) <br>
HELEN: Fifi! <br>
DOCTOR: Fifi? <br>
(Helen rushes to Fifi and cries over her body. Ace joins the Doctor.) <br>
ACE: Shouldn't we do something, Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: 'Tis done. </font></p>

and carrying paint pots. They have removed the garish wigs.) <br>
DAISY: This is all your fault, Priscilla. <br>
PRISCILLA: I'm glad you're happy, Daisy. <br>
(The Doctor and Ace are with Wences and Wulfric, and Susan and Earl.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's been a long night and I think we ought to be off. What
about you, Earl? <br>
EARL: Think I'll hang out here for a while, Doc. See if I can teach
this planet the blues again. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, thank you for giving them back to us, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
SUSAN: The blues. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. There are no other colours without the blues. <br>
(The Doctor and Earl exchange the complicated Black Brotherhood
handshake, then he and Ace go to the Tardis and she finishes repainting
it blue.) <br>
ACE: Will they be all right, Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: Happiness will prevail. </font> </p>
