a sign warning 'it is forbidden to dump bodies into the river'. He
wrenches a metal collar off with a cry and walks down the steps into
the water, where he drowns. Then the Tardis materialises. </font></p>

DOCTOR: It's not clear. It's not clear at all. What has gone wrong? <br>
IAN: Well, Doctor, where are we now, then. <br>
BARBARA: Somewhere nice and quiet, I hope. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, yes. Let's have a holiday. <br>
DOCTOR: Take a look for yourselves. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I can't see anything. <br>
IAN: Neither can I. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like moving water to me. It might be a river
somewhere. I don't know. What's the reading, Susan? <br>
SUSAN: Radiation nil, oxygen normal, pressure normal. Grandfather, it's
an Earth reading. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don't want to boast, but we might be somewhere in
London, hmm? <br>
IAN: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go and have a look. <br>
BARBARA: Come on, open the doors. </font></p>

definitely London) <br>
IAN: Barbara, we made it. We're here! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there we are. Back home. Your planet. <br>
IAN: You brought us a long way round, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: More by good luck than judgment. What a horrible mess. <br>
BARBARA: Are we down by the docks? <br>
IAN: (shouts) Hello! Pretty deserted. Probably Sunday. <br>
DOCTOR: It's uncanny. Wonder which era we've landed in? <br>
IAN: What was that, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm just wondering about the time factor, my boy. <br>
IAN: Oh, a year or two either way doesn't make much difference to us,
you know. <br>
DOCTOR: Well I hope for both your sakes we're near your time, but bear
in mind we might have landed in the early 1900s or the 25th century. <br>
BARBARA: Well, it's still London, anyway. <br>
IAN: Yes. Hey, what are you doing? <br>
SUSAN: I'm just having a look. Can't see much down there, can you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the word I was looking for, decay. It's most odd,
most odd. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, what's worrying you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you take this bridge, now. It isn't an easy task, is it?
Look at all this neglect all over the place. It's been abandoned, all
of it. <br>
IAN: There's always a mess with construction work, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps, perhaps. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, come on, Doctor. Stop spoiling everything. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh my dear, now believe you me, I wouldn't spoil your
homecoming for all the world. <br>
SUSAN: (at the top of the wall) Still can't see much. There's not a
sign of any people anywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Be careful, my child. <br>
(too late, she falls) <br>
IAN: Susan. <br>
BARBARA: I think she's just shaken. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're always dashing about, aren't you. You're far too
curious. <br>
IAN: You're lucky it wasn't any worse. <br>
SUSAN: My ankle. <br>
IAN: Look out, this whole thing's going to go! <br>
(they carry Susan away just as the bridge collapses onto the Tardis) <br>
DOCTOR: The ship, Chesterton. The ship! Don't go to near, my boy, its
not safe. <br>
IAN: The whole bridge has collapsed. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's all crumbling. <br>
IAN: We're going to need help to shift this. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's going to be very difficult, but remember we're in
London. <br>
IAN: What's that got to do with it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the people, they'll all be curious. They'll want to know
why we're trying to break into a police box. <br>
IAN: Yes. If they don't ask what a police box is doing under a bridge
in the first place. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. <br>
IAN: You know, it's primarily this girder. What I need is an acetylene
torch. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear boy, you can't just whisk up men and material out
of the thin air now, can you, hmm? <br>
IAN: There's a warehouse over there, Doctor. I might be able to find a
crowbar or something. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, my dear boy, I never fail to be impressed by your
optimism. You can't move that by sheer brute force. You were right, you
need a cutting flame. <br>
IAN: I know one thing for sure, Doctor. We'd better make sure we can
get back into the ship before we start looking around, just in case
there's trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: It's intelligent. That's good. But you know, young man, I have
a feeling, or call it intuition if you like. I don't believe we're
anywhere near your time, the 1960's.  <br> 
IAN: I hope it is only
an intuition, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, ask yourself. Here we are, standing by the Thames
and we've been here quite a while, how long? Quarter of an hour, twenty
minute? <br>
IAN: Easily, but what about it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what have we heard? Nothing. Precisely nothing. No sound
of birdsong, no voices, no sound of shipping, and not even the chimes
of old Big Ben. It's uncanny. Uncanny. <br>
SUSAN: I'm lucky, aren't I? <br>
BARBARA: There are no bones broken, anyway. <br>
SUSAN: Thank goodness. I'm sorry about what happened, Grandfather. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, so you're sitting up and taking notice again, are you? <br>
SUSAN: Don't be angry with me, there's no real harm done was there? I
just twisted my ankle. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no harm done, child. No harm done, no. Do you realise we
can't get into the ship? What's all this rubble then? Look at it. <br>
SUSAN: I didn't pull the bridge down on purpose. <br>
IAN: The Doctor and I are going to have a look in that warehouse over
there. <br>
BARBARA: Well, can't we all go? <br>
IAN: Well, how's your ankle, Susan? <br>
SUSAN: I'll try it. <br>
(but she can't put her weight on it) <br>
SUSAN: It's not very good, is it. It's awfully swollen. <br>
IAN: Well, that settles it then. You need to stay here. <br>
DOCTOR: We shall be as quick as we can. And you bathe that ankle. What
you need is a jolly good smacked bottom! Come on. <br>
(Ian and the Doctor leave) <br>
BARBARA: Oh, Susan, it is swollen. Can you twiddle your toes? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. That's all right. <br>
BARBARA: You wait here then. I'll go and wet my handkerchief in the
river. <br>
SUSAN: I'm sorry, Barbara. </font></p>

BARBARA: You know, we're not in our time in London, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Why do you say that? <br>
BARBARA: Well, I know London, and it isn't like this. The river's too
quiet and there's no sound of traffic. There's a strange poster on the
wall back there. It just doesn't make sense. <br>
SUSAN: Well, off we go again. I'm sorry, Barbara. Is it selfish to want
us all to stay together? <br>
BARBARA: No, of course not. We ought to be able to hear something. It's
ridiculous. <br>
SUSAN: Things have to stay as they are, don't they. Can't change. <br>
BARBARA: I suppose so. Anyway, maybe they've done away with noise
altogether. How's your ankle feeling? <br>
SUSAN: It's throbbing crazy. <br>
BARBARA: I don't think this is wet enough. Hold on a minute. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Chesterton, come here. <br>
IAN: Empty. <br>
DOCTOR: What a musty smell. This place hasn't been used in years. <br>
IAN: (looking out of the window) Doctor, it's lost two chimneys. <br>
DOCTOR: What's that monstrosity out there? <br>
IAN: It's Battersea Power Station. I wonder what's happened to those
two chimneys? <br>
DOCTOR: What's happened to London, dear boy, is more to the point. <br>
IAN: They must have gone over to nuclear power. <br>
DOCTOR: What's this, then? <br>
(the Doctor finds a calendar in a desk drawer) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, here, look. At least we know the century, dear boy. Look. <br>

she sees the body of the suicide float past. She goes back to) <br>
BARBARA: Susan? Susan! <br>

BARBARA: Who are you? <br>
Do you want to get killed? <br>
BARBARA: Where's Susan? What have you done with her? <br>
You mean the girl? Tyler's got her. Come on, we've got to get out of
here. Quick, follow me! <br>

DOCTOR: There's so much rubbish. It's a jungle here. <br>
(he knocks over a cardboard box, and a man wearing a metal helmet falls
out) <br>
IAN: What the? He's dead. What on earth is this? <br>
DOCTOR: It looks like some sort of adornment, but what for? <br>
IAN: I don't know. Do you think it could be some sort of medical aid?
You know, if he'd fractured his skull, something to knit the bones
together? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I think there's something more to it than that. You know, I
think that this is an extra ear, ideal for picking up high-frequency
radio waves. <br>
IAN: You mean these people have invented some form of personal
communication? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. <br>
IAN: What's this? A whip. Why. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, whatever it is, I wouldn't like to meet one of these
fellows, you know. <br>
(something creaks, they stand and then see the knife in the back of the
dead man) <br>
DOCTOR: He was murdered! <br>
(They go looking for the source of the creaking. Ian kicks down a door)
<br>
IAN: Storeroom. That noise came from up here. <br>
(He kicks in another door, and falls outside. Ian manages to grab hold
of an iron framework. The Doctor helps him back up and in) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, dear boy, come on. <br>
IAN: No one can get through that way. <br>
DOCTOR: Except you. I think we'd better pause in this search and get
back to the others. Come along. <br>

across the river. <br>
IAN: Yes, I suppose they might have hidden somewhere. <br>

IAN: That body. You know, I want to get away from here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but aren't you even a bit curious? After all, it's your

TYLER: Yes. <br>
DAVID: Dortmun's on the rampage. And who have we got here? <br>
TYLER: I found a couple of them down by the river. Open targets. <br>
BARBARA: Well, we didn't know. <br>
TYLER: I suppose you didn't, but you know now. <br>

BARBARA: Yes, I can get by. <br>
DAVID: Good, we need some cooks. <br>
BARBARA: Listen, I <br>
TYLER: All right, let's get down. <br>
DAVID: Listen, I had a struggle with one of the Robomen. <br>
TYLER: Well? <br>
DAVID: Well, he was waiting for me! That means that we'll have to
change the storehouse. <br>
TYLER: All right, tell Dortmun. Have you just come from there? <br>
DAVID: Yes. <br>
TYLER: These have got a couple of friends down there they want us to
bring back. <br>
DAVID: Well I didn't see anyone there except that I was nearly caught
by a couple... They didn't go into the old warehouse, did they, that's
opposite the old power station? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, I think they did. <br>
DAVID: Yeah, and I thought they were enemies. <br>
(a man in a wheelchair enters) <br>
DORTMUN: Tyler, where have you been? What the devil have you been
doing? <br>
TYLER: They've landed a saucer at the heliport. <br>

TYLER: Yes. <br>
DORTMUN: Ah, this time we'll be ready for them. <br>
TYLER: You shouldn't be up here. <br>

DAVID: Well, there's two more of them down by the warehouse. <br>
DORTMUN: Men, are they? <br>
DAVID: Yes. <br>
DORTMUN: Good. Don't be too long away. I'm going through the attack
plans with Tyler as soon as possible. I want you to be there. <br>

DORTMUN: Why are you sitting down? <br>

DOCTOR: Huh, stupid. <br>
IAN: Read it, read it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I repeat, it's stupid. A stupid place to put a poster.
Right under a bridge where nobody can read it or see it. <br>
IAN: I don't know. If you have a body to get rid of, I should think
it's a very good place to come to. <br>

murder, isn't it, hmm? <br>

Square. Somewhere over there, anyway. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, now, never mind about that flying saucer, my boy. That
suggestion of yours about the plague. Supposing one of them's been in
that water. They're bound to be contaminated with some sort of
bacteria! <br>
IAN: They're not likely to drink that, are they. <br>
DOCTOR: No, the smell of it's enough. Anyway, let us go further afield.

DORTMUN: Oh, right. <br>
TYLER: And what about the two men? <br>
DAVID: When I got down to the embankment I saw them being taken away,
but I couldn't do anything. <br>
DORTMUN: Oh, that's bad, that's very bad. We could have done with those
two men. <br>
DAVID: I'll tell the two women. <br>
TYLER: Where were the men taken? Any idea? <br>
DAVID: From the direction they went, I think the Daleks have taken them
the saucer they landed at the heliport in Chelsea. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: Doctor, I don't understand this at all. We
saw the Daleks destroyed on Skaro. We were there. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, what in Skaro was a million years ahead of us in
the future. What we're seeing now is about the middle history of the
Daleks. <br>
IAN: I see. They certainly look different, don't they. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, they've taken some more prisoners. What is so different
about the Daleks? Oh, I see. You mean the discs on their backs. <br>
IAN: Yes. Perhaps that accounts for their increased mobility. Do you
remember, on Skaro they could only move on metal. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite so. But remember, this is an invasion force,
therefore they have to adapt themselves to the planet. <br>
DALEK: Where are the other two from your patrol? <br>
ROBOMAN: This man killed them both. <br>
DALEK: For this you will be punished. Continue your patrol. The
prisoners will fall in line. <br>
CRADDOCK: There'll be no escape once they get us inside there. <br>
MAN 3: They're not getting me. I'm going to try something. You with me?
<br>

DALEK 2: The prisoners will remain silent. <br>
ROBOMAN: Forward. <br>

away, but a Dalek gets in his way. He circles round, and the Daleks
gather. One has a black top and black side panels - and a very

SUSAN: Oh they're the Dalek's invention. They're called Robomen. <br>
DAVID: No, Susan, I told you. You've got it wrong. We took these from
dead human beings. <br>
JENNY: There aren't that many Daleks on Earth. They needed helpers so
they operated on some of their prisoners and turned them into robots. <br>
BARBARA: I see. <br>
DAVID: The transfer, as the Daleks call the operation, controls the
human brain, well at least for a time. <br>
SUSAN: What happens then? <br>
BARBARA: Do they revert and become human again? <br>
JENNY: No. They die. <br>
DAVID: I've seen the Robos when they break down. They go insane. They
smash their heads against walls, they throw themselves off buildings or
into the river. <br>
BARBARA: The river? That's what it was. Daleks. Everything they touch
turns into a horrible sort of nightmare. <br>
SUSAN: Are they still doing these transfer operations, David? <br>
JENNY: Oh, yes. They keep up their numbers of Robomen. They got my
brother last year. That's another reason why they saucers at the

them. Once they've got you on board a saucer, there isn't a hope. </font></p>

CRADDOCK: You're just fooling yourselves. You don't know the Daleks.

Everything. <br>
CRADDOCK: Have you been on a moon station or something? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
CRADDOCK: Well, meteorites came first. The Earth was bombarded with
them about ten years ago. A cosmic storm, the scientists called it. The
meteorites stopped, everything settled down, and then people began to
die of this new kind of plague. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that explains your poster, dear boy. Germ bombs, hmm? <br>
CRADDOCK: Yes. The Daleks were up in the sky just waiting for Earth to
get weaker. Whole continents of people were wiped out. Asia, Africa,
South America. They used to say the Earth had a smell of death about
it. <br>
IAN: Why, Craddock? What were the doctors and the scientists doing
about it? <br>
CRADDOCK: Oh, well, they came up with some new kind of drug but it was
too late then. <br>

DAVID: Well, the plague had split the world into tiny little
communities, too far apart to combine and fight, and too small
individually to stand any chance against invasion. <br>
BARBARA: Divide and conquer. <br>
DAVID: Hmm. About six months after the meteorite fall, that's when the
saucers landed. Cities were razed to the ground, others were simply
occupied. Anyone who resisted was destroyed. Some people were captured
and were turned into Robomen, the slaves of the Daleks. They caught
other human beings and many of them were shipped to the vast mining
areas. No one escapes. The Robomen see to that. </font></p>

IAN: But why, Craddock? That's the one thing you haven't told us. What
is it that the Daleks want on Earth? <br>

BARBARA: Some of your men could disguise themselves as Robomen. They
could pretend to be escorting a batch of prisoners to the saucer, or
something. <br>

CRADDOCK: A magnifying glass. I just picked it up. <br>
IAN: Hey, Doctor, come and look at this. Look. What do you make of
this? <br>

(It is a block of perspex with seven vertical tubes cut into it and a
piece of metal in the middle) <br>

IAN: Is it glass or something? <br>
DOCTOR: I should say it was more advanced than that. Well now, let's
try a little experiment. <br>
IAN: All right. <br>
(As the Doctor holds the bar above the block, the metal piece inside
moves along) <br>
IAN: Hey! <br>
DOCTOR: You see? It responds. Magnetised. <br>
CRADDOCK: A profound discover, mister. Doesn't help us. <br>
IAN: Why did the Daleks put it there in the first place? <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's a very good question, dear boy. Suppose you were a
Dalek and you found yourself locked up in this room. How would you get
out? <br>
CRADDOCK: Push the door open? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear young man, the Daleks have only feelers, no hands, and
they use their brains, not brute force. <br>
IAN: You mean this is some sort of a key? <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's the very word. A key in a crystal box. You open the
box, take out the key and use it. That is precisely what the Dalek
would do. <br>
IAN: Yes, but what are we going to do, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Look at that little light up there. <br>
IAN: Yes, I see. And the box is transparent. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite. Let me have that thing, will you? <br>
CRADDOCK: What, this? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that. Thank you. <br>
(He holds the magnifying glass above the box) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, we have to make sure that we hit the correct refractive,
otherwise we shall get showered with crystal glass. <br>
CRADDOCK: Refractive rubbish! The Daleks don't leave things like this
about for you to help yourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, if they had to deal with a man of your talents,
they need hardly fear, need they. Now do sit down and rest, please. Oh,
dear, now where were we? Ah, yes, of course, yes, yes, yes. Now, X
equals gamma, that means roughly two and a half percent, so that should
give us a curve of around about eighty degrees. Oh by the way, did you
take three dimensional graph geometry at your school, hmm? <br>
IAN: No, Doctor, only Boyle's Law. <br>
DOCTOR: What a pity. What a pity. We shall have to boil this down now,
shan't we. Well, now then, let's see. We'll start third from the left
and then I'll follow it from the right and straight over. All right?
Now put that bar there, and watch your eyes because you know, it might
be nasty. Are you ready? <br>
(Ian holds the metal bar at the end of the box, where there is a hole) <br>
CRADDOCK: And a great big pumpkin too. <br>
(Then the metal shoots out of the box) <br>
IAN: Hey, look at that. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold that and shut up, will you. Pay attention. Let me have the
bar, please. <br>
IAN: You know, Doctor, sometimes you astound me. <br>
DOCTOR: Only sometimes, dear boy? What's happened to your memory? Don't
you remember we know that the Daleks can use static electricity? <br>
IAN: Of course. <br>
CRADDOCK: Hey, how do you know so much about them, the Daleks I mean. <br>
IAN: We met them once before. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and we happened to outwit them, too. Please go away, will
you? Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. Now, all we have to do is to slide
this bar back here, and the self-same bar slides back into place here
through electricity. <br>
IAN: And it's held in place by magnetic force. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. Now I want you to give him a hand in a minute. Just
turn that pole under there, will you. There, you see? <br>
IAN: I see what you mean. Like poles repel, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. Now we've created a force field. Right, now
turn the pole round. Give him a hand, quickly. Come on. <br>
(It takes both men to handle the metal bar now) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>

DAVID: Well, we had to leave him by the old plague cemetery. We're
trying to find a way out of this area. <br>
TYLER: You don't know how lucky you were. At first I took you for
scavengers. I met a couple down here already but this kept them off. <br>
SUSAN: You shot at one of them, didn't you. I found this. (the
cartridge case) <br>
TYLER: I wasn't shooting at a man. These sewers are full of alligators.
<br>
SUSAN: Alligators? In the sewers of London? <br>
TYLER: A lot of animals escaped from zoos during the plague. Most were
killed but reptiles thrive down here. <br>
DAVID: Well then, I think the quicker we get going, the better? <br>
SUSAN: What's worse, the alligators down here or the Daleks up there? <br>
DAVID: Tyler, will you give us a hand to collect the old man? <br>
TYLER: I'll take you. You're going the wrong way anyway. Now, you take
the back, behind Susan. That way we've got guns front and rear. <br>
DAVID: Right, Tyler. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, Tyler? Barbara and Ian, do you know where they are? <br>
TYLER: I'm sorry, no. I'll go ahead now. You stay here til I call. <br>

SUSAN: Why is he so abrupt? <br>
DAVID: Tyler? He's afraid to make friends. He's known too much killing.
<br>
SUSAN: Well, I hope I'm never like that, pretending not to care. <br>
DAVID: Bah. One day this will be all over. It'll mean a new start. <br>
SUSAN: A new start? Rebuilding a planet from the very beginning. It's a
wonderful idea. <br>

immediately on what I told you. I must speak to someone in authority. <br>
