<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (It is a dark and stormy night on a distant
planet. The castle appears to have been carved halfway up the steep
sides of a mountain, yet still boasts impressive battlements and
crenellations. It's passages are lit by flaming torches and its guards
are semi-clad in leather, and hold pikestaffs. A man in a flowing cloak
enters and bows to the young king and his advisor. Everyone say Hi! to
Patrick Troughton's son, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0873739/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">David</a>.) <br>
TORBIS: The delegate from Alpha Centauri has arrived, your Majesty. He
will present his credentials to you shortly. <br>
PELADON: Thank you, Torbis. <br>
TORBIS: We wait now only for the chairman delegate from Earth. Then the
discussions can begin. <br>
(A taller man wearing the same blue robes, and with the same white hair
and beard with brown stripe across the top of the head, speaks.) <br>
HEPESH: You will persist then in this folly? Nothing I can say will
deter you? <br>
TORBIS: Hepesh, you have already had your say in the Grand Council. The
question has been discussed and decided. <br>
HEPESH: Decided by you, Torbis, and the fools who support you! You
mislead the King, you abandon the ancient ways of our people. <br>
TORBIS: Nothing but ignorance and superstition. <br>
HEPESH: You will bring the curse of Aggedor upon us! <br>
TORBIS: It'll take much more than your childish mumbo-jumbo to frighten
me. <br>
PELADON: Enough! I will not have my Chancellor and my High Priest
squabbling on the steps of the throne. <br>
HEPESH: You Majesty is right to rebuke us, nevertheless I must persist <br>
TORBIS: Must I remind you, Priest <br>
PELADON: My friends! My good friends. You are more to me than my
Chancellors, my regents, much more. It grieves my heart to hear such
hate between two brothers. <br>
TORBIS: May I speak, your Majesty? <br>
PELADON: Very well. <br>
TORBIS: It was not I who chose to quarrel. Ever since the death of his
exalted Majesty, your father, I have been as a parent to you. If you
should forget now all that I have ever taught you, if you should let
the superstitious fear of this foolish man <br>
HEPESH: The folly has not been mine but yours. <br>
TORBIS: Your Majesty, my whole life would be a failure. As a sacred
trust, I undertook to <br>
HEPESH: Sacred trust? <br>
PELADON: Hepesh, please! Torbis, I shall not betray you. <br>
HEPESH: But sire! <br>
PELADON: No, Hepesh! The decision has been taken. If the committee of
assessment judges favourably, then Peladon will join the Galactic
Federation. And I shall expect your loyal help and support at this
difficult time. <br>
HEPESH: Your Majesty. <br>
PELADON: Torbis, please inform the others that Alpha Centauri has
arrived. <br>
(Torbis leaves, and strides along the corridor until a large shadow
falls across him. He looks up and tries to protect himself as it roars.
A guard, Peladon and Hepesh hear the sound and run out of the throne
room.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The guard gets to Torbis first, then he too is
attacked by the large something before it retreats and Peladon
arrives.) <br>
PELADON: Torbis! Torbis! <br>
HEPESH: Grun, what happened? What happened, Grun? <br>
(The guard, Grun, is a mute. He points at an emblem on a torch sconce.)
<br>
HEPESH: So, the spirit of Aggedor has risen again. The ancient curse of
Peladon will be fulfilled.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis has materialised on a small ledge some
way below the castle. The Doctor has exchanged his velvet jacket and
cloak for plaid ones, and Jo looks like she's going to a debutante's
ball.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you are, Jo. A perfect landing. <br>
JO: And about time too. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, Miss Grant. Let's not be impatient. <br>
JO: Impatient? Look, I'm all dolled up. I'm all dolled up for a night
out on the town with Mike Yates when you talk me into a joyride in this
thing. <br>
DOCTOR: It's hardly a joyride, Jo. This is the Tardis' first test
flight since I got it working again. <br>
JO: Yes, I know, but you said we'd only. You said we'd only be a few
minutes, right? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. <br>
JO: Well we've been simply ages. Look, I'm going to be very late, so if
you'll just open the doors and let me out, I'll be <br>
DOCTOR: One minute, Jo. Routine landing procedures first, eh? Let's see
what the scanners have to tell us. <br>
JO: Precisely nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Must be on the blink. <br>
JO: I might have expected it. The Tardis always is. <br>
DOCTOR: I hope you're as in good condition when you're as old as she
is. <br>
(The Doctor takes a component from the underside of the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, let's have a look. Yes. Yes, there's a tiny fault in the
interstitial beam synthesiser. Still, I can put that right later. <br>
(The Doctor puts the component in his pocket.) <br>
JO: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm? <br>
JO: You're sure we're back at base? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, everything outside seems perfectly normal.
Atmosphere, temperature, gravity. Yeah. Cheer up, Jo. It's a perfect
landing. <br>
(The Tardis suddenly tilts.) <br>
JO: You did say perfect? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The ledge is half as wide as the Tardis, which is
being buffeted by the strong winds. Luckily, or otherwise, the Tardis
has landed with her doors opening onto the ledge. The Doctor jumps out
and looks straight down the precipice.) <br>
JO [OC]: Doctor, what's the matter? Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we seem to be half way up a mountain. We're balanced on
the edge. <br>
JO [OC]: Well, what are we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Come towards me. Come on! Now, give me your hand, very, very
gently! Ready now? <br>
JO: Yes! <br>
DOCTOR: Right, jump! <br>
(Jo leaps into the Doctor's arms and the Tardis now tumbles down the
mountainside.) <br>
JO: It's smashed to pieces! <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, the Tardis may have its faults, but it is indestructible.
Our main worry is how to get to it. We certainly can't climb down
there. Jo! Jo, look up there! <br>
JO: Oo, looks a bit doomy. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we certainly can't recover the Tardis by ourselves. We'd
better get up there and see if we can find help. <br>
JO: Up there? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's right. <br>
JO: But I'm not exactly dressed for mountaineering. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you could always wait here, I suppose. <br>
JO: No thanks. Anyway, we don't even know where we are. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. So the sooner we find out, the better. Come on.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A non-humanoid enters. It is upright, green, with
one large eye above the frill of its cloak, and six grasping appendages
round its thorax.) <br>
HEPESH: The delegate from Alpha Centauri, member of the Galactic
Federation, presents his credentials before his Majesty, King Peladon. <br>
PELADON: Peladon welcomes the delegate from Alpha Centauri. <br>
(Although described as he, Alpha Centauri speaks with an extremely
high-pitched voice and a tendency to bounce up and down.) <br>
ALPHA: As a member of the preliminary assessment commission, I have
great hopes that your planet will be acceptable as a candidate for the
Galactic Federation. <br>
PELADON: That is my firm intention. My Chancellor will (pause) My High
Priest will give you all assistance to this end. <br>
HEPESH: We willing accept the hands of true friendship. Unfortunately,
discussions cannot begin until the arrival of the chairman delegate
from Earth. <br>
PELADON: He will be here soon, Hepesh, never fear. Earth is many light
years away from us? Is that not so, Alpha Centauri? <br>
ALPHA: Indeed, your Majesty. (giggles) A remote and unattractive planet
at best. <br>
HEPESH: I say again the omens are not good. <br>
PELADON: Hepesh. <br>
HEPESH: Once before your Majesty saw fit to ignore my warnings, and now
your Chancellor, Torbis, lies dead, slain by the wrath of Aggedor. <br>
PELADON: Hepesh, enough! <br>
ALPHA: Slain? Danger here? Then the conference must be cancelled! <br>
PELADON: This is not a matter to trouble the delegates. Torbis, my
former Chancellor, died earlier tonight in mysterious circumstances.
But the truth will be brought to light. Meanwhile, there is no danger
to you or to your fellow delegates. <br>
ALPHA: I accept your Majesty's assurances. <br>
PELADON: Thank you. Lord Hepesh will take you to your fellow delegates.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Amidst the thunder and lightning, the Doctor and
Jo crawl up the rough steep slope where only a few scrawny clumps of
grass survive. They rest on a small ledge. Jo is out of breath.) <br>
JO: It's no good. I can't go any further. I nearly broke my neck coming
up this far. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we certainly can't stay here, Jo. I'll tell you what.
Let's traverse along this ledge for a bit. I'll see if there's another
way out. Have a look that way. <br>
JO: Okay. <br>
(They split up.) <br>
JO [OC]: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, what is it? Jo? Jo, where are you? Jo, where are you? <br>
(Jo looks out of an opening in the rock.) <br>
JO: Over here! Come on! <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
JO: A tunnel. Come on.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Delegate's conference room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A pair of doors decorated with the same face as
the torch sconce open.) <br>
HEPESH: This chamber is reserved for the delegate's private meetings. <br>
ARCTURUS: Greetings. You are the delegate from Alpha Centauri? (An
electronic voice comes from a head in a glass dome on top of a tank.
Liquid constantly flows down the inside of the dome.) <br>
HEPESH: The delegate from Arcturus. <br>
ALPHA: Greetings, delegate. There has been an incident. A court
official has been slain. <br>
ARCTURUS: Slain? There has been violence? I am in danger? <br>
HEPESH: An internal matter, delegate Arcturus. Do not be concerned. <br>
ARCTURUS: The delegation must be concerned, if only for its own safety.
<br>
ALPHA: We are committed to the rejection of violence. <br>
ARCTURUS: But we are capable of self defence, should it prove
necessary. Allow me to demonstrate. <br>
(A small dish emerges from the bottom of the tank. There is a red flash
and an innocent decorated pot on a pedestal is destroyed.) <br>
ARCTURUS: So, be warned. Do not provoke us. <br>
HEPESH: We desire only your friendship. <br>
ARCTURUS: Then make sure that our mission is not endangered.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Jo come to a grill looking into a
room with flaming torches by a large stone statue of a creature with
raised claws.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, come at look at this. <br>
JO: What on Earth is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It looks like some sort of shrine. <br>
JO: I've never seen anything like it before. <br>
DOCTOR: No, neither have I. At least not on Earth. Come on.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Throne room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PELADON: I remember when you and Torbis first
brought me to this throne room. <br>
HEPESH: At first you refused to sit upon the throne. You said that
rightfully it could only be your father's place. <br>
PELADON: But Torbis lifted me up and set me here. And then you said <br>
HEPESH: And then I said, though the royal blood that flows in your
veins is mingled with that of strangers, yet you shall be Peladon of
Peladon. Greater than your father, greater than any past or future
king. And then the Earth woman <br>
PELADON: And then my mother, Hepesh. She smiled and placed my left hand
in yours and my right hand in Torbis's. <br>
HEPESH: And together we made a boy into a king. <br>
PELADON: And now Torbis is dead. <br>
HEPESH: His task was almost done, as mine will be when once I have
anointed you king. <br>
PELADON: Why did he die, Hepesh? <br>
HEPESH: He saw your future as a servant of the Galactic Federation. I
see you as an independent ruler of a great and glorious kingdom. <br>
PELADON: You really believe he was destroyed by Aggedor, don't you? <br>
HEPESH: Yes, it was a warning. <br>
PELADON: But the Federation delegates are here at my invitation. It
should have been me that was struck down. <br>
HEPESH: No. No, it was Torbis blind advice that would have destroyed
your kingdom. You would have become a slave, not a king. <br>
PELADON: But Hepesh, you were always telling me a king must choose and
choose courageously. <br>
HEPESH: Aggedor has shown the way. <br>
PELADON: Backwards into superstition? It was you who taught me to
fight, to ride, and to think. Help me to realise my dream. I know what
is best for my people. <br>
HEPESH: I do not trust these aliens. <br>
PELADON: Well then, trust me.&nbsp;<br>
HEPESH: I tell you, I know their minds. I will not let them lead you
into a trap. <br>
PELADON: But their motives are open and honest. <br>
HEPESH: But to them, Peladon, we are merely savages. Savages to be
tamed. They despise and distrust us. <br>
PELADON: Then I will talk to them, convince them. Summon the delegates.
Now, Hepesh!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JO: Which way now? <br>
DOCTOR: Which way indeed? Eenie, meenie, mynie, mo. <br>
(Roar in the distance.) <br>
JO: Meenie? <br>
(They head away from the roar.) <br>
JO: Oh no, it's blocked up. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. If the tunnel's never used, why is this torch still
alight? <br>
(The Doctor grasps the sconce. It doesn't move down but it does move
up, and a concealed door springs open.) <br>
JO: Right again, Doctor.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> &nbsp;(They peer around the side of a
tapestry.) <br>
JO: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Somewhere inside the castle, I should think. Let's take a look
around. <br>
(There are footsteps so they duck back behind the tapestry as a
familiar scaly-armoured green figure hisses its way past. They follow
it to a corner.) <br>
JO: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: That, Jo, was an Ice Warrior. A native of the planet Mars. <br>
JO: You've seen them before? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed I have, and believe me, they're not very pleasant
company. <br>
JO: Oh, come on, let's get back to the tunnel quickly. <br>
(But castle guards have arrived and now surround them.)

place by it's master, still green and permanently out of breath, but no
scaly armour and a long cloak.) <br>
PELADON: Thank you. By now, you all know of the tragic incident
involving my Chancellor, Torbis. He was more than an advisor. He was,
like Hepesh, a trusted friend. <br>
IZLYR: (the Ice Lord) And yet he was killed. Why? <br>
HEPESH: It was a supernatural warning. <br>
PELADON: My High Priest connects this death with one of our ancient
legends. <br>
ARCTURUS: Your Priest speaks of a warning. Perhaps it is more than
that. <br>
PELADON: Superstition, nothing more. <br>
IZLYR: This incident could well mean a threat to us, and to the
Federation. <br>
PELADON: But it was Torbis who died. The legend only concerns my
people. <br>
ALPHA: Your legend seems violent and unpleasant, and rather too
convenient. <br>
HEPESH: The legend of the curse of Peladon has been handed down through
countless centuries. <br>
IZLYR: I think, perhaps, we should hear this legend. <br>
HEPESH: It concerns the royal beast of Peladon, now extinct. It is
written, Mighty is Aggedor, fiercest of all the beasts of Peladon.
Young men would hunt it to prove their courage. His fur trims our royal
garment. His head is our royal emblem. It is also written there will
come a day when the spirit of Aggedor will rise again to warn and
defend his royal master, King Peladon. For at that day, a stranger will
appear in the land, bringing peril to Peladon. <br>
(Peladon sees the Doctor and Jo being brought in by the guards.) <br>
HEPESH: And great tribulation to his kingdom. <br>
(The Doctor stares as the Ice Warriors approach him.) <br>
IZLYR: Chairman delegate from Earth, greetings. Delegate Izlyr from
Mars. Sub-delegate Ssorg. <br>
(At a nod from Hepesh, Grun leaves Peladon's side and goes out behind a
tapestry.) <br>
ALPHA: Delegate Alpha Centauri. The Galactic Committee is terribly in
need of your experience and judgement. <br>
ARCTURUS: I am delegate Arcturus. You are late. <br>
DOCTOR: Late? Er, yes, my apologies to the Committee but, er, our space
shuttle crash-landed down the mountain. I wonder if something could be
done about rescuing it. <br>
HEPESH: That will be arranged. I am Hepesh, High Priest of Peladon. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do? <br>
HEPESH: Protocol demands that you should present formally your
credentials to King Peladon. Hand them to me. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid that will not be possible. We have lost everything
in the crash. <br>
PELADON: We can deal with protocol later, Hepesh. Present the chairman
delegate from Earth, and his companion. <br>
HEPESH: I presume this female is of royal blood? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, naturally. Why, why do you bother to ask? <br>
HEPESH: We are standing in the royal throne room of Peladon. Only men
of rank and females of royal blood may set foot here. The penalty for
trespass is death. <br>
JO: Doctor, I do not deal through intermediaries. Kindly present us to
our royal host. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Will you excuse me. <br>
(The Doctor kneels before Peladon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty, as delegate from Earth, I greet you. May I
present Her Royal Highness, the Princess Josephine, of Tardis. <br>
(Peladon stands. Jo walks forward and curtsies, and Peladon takes her
hand.) <br>
PELADON: Greetings, Princess. I'm sorry to hear that your journey ended
so uncomfortably. <br>
JO: The whole affair was most deplorable. The pilot was exceedingly
inefficient. <br>
PELADON: Well, I'm glad it was nothing more. You bring a welcome beauty
to a serious occasion. <br>
JO: Thank you, your Majesty. <br>
IZLYR: Royal Highness. <br>
(The Doctor has to nudge Jo to stop looking into Peladon's eyes and
turn to the Ice Lord instead.) <br>
IZLYR: What are your powers on the committee of assessment? <br>
DOCTOR: The Princess is here in the capacity of a royal observer only. <br>
IZLYR: Ah, as on my planet, you still retain the aristocratic process. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, in a democratic sort of way. <br>
ARCTURUS: Chairman delegate from Earth, we are not here to indulge in
social diplomacy. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, of course not, I <br>
ARCTURUS: We are here to consider admitting this somewhat primitive
planet into the Galactic Federation. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for reminding me. I <br>

violently. <br>

the end of a long pole under the base of yet another statue of Aggedor.

chairman delegate. <br>
ARCTURUS [OC]: By a legend, we are told. <br>

HEPESH: You are right, chairman delegate. Moreover, the throne room is
hardly the place for such discussions. <br>
IZLYR: Then perhaps we should withdraw to the delegate's conference
room. <br>
DOCTOR: That is a splendid idea. <br>

PELADON: Princess? I do look forward to speaking with you again, less
formally. <br>

JO: Well I feel definitely wobbly at the knees. <br>

HEPESH: Aggedor has been merciful. We must give thanks that you have
all been spared. <br>
DOCTOR: I think we should investigate what caused this, Hepesh. <br>
ALPHA: I agree. <br>
IZLYR: Yes, indeed. <br>
DOCTOR: If only as a matter of protocol. <br>
(Grun is back in the throne room.) <br>
HEPESH: It is a sign of Aggedor's anger. His ghost walks amongst us. <br>
DOCTOR: It must have been a pretty substantial type of ghost to have
shifted a solid granite statue. <br>
ALPHA: Yes, very. <br>
HEPESH: The spirit of Aggedor can move mountains. <br>
JO: It seemed more like he was trying to remove us. <br>
ALPHA: Our mission is peaceful, We come to help your people, to raise
them from barbarism. <br>
JO: Maybe they don't want to be raised. <br>
IZLYR: Hepesh, you say this is foretold in your ancient writings. What
sort of manifestation is there supposed to be? <br>
HEPESH: It is written, his coming shall be full or terror and darkness.
His cry shall be heard in the night, and death shall walk in the land
of Peladon! <br>
JO: Well, there was no cry of warning, and nobody actually saw him, did
they? <br>
HEPESH: To the unbeliever, all signs are as dust in the wind. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the point is what does King Peladon believe? <br>
IZLYR: If this man speaks for King Peladon, our purpose here is wasted.
<br>
ARCTURUS: The conference must be cancelled. <br>
HEPESH: I agree. <br>

us? Hepesh.

IZLYR: Negotiations are only possible in a peaceful atmosphere. <br>
ARCTURUS: Political conflict violates Federation law. <br>
PELADON: Centuries ago on your own planets, war and violence
flourished. <br>

ourselves from the dark ages. Do not desert us now. <br>

DOCTOR: Your Majesty is an enlightened ruler, but who will your people
believe? King Peladon or Aggedor? <br>

being cleared away. She finds a small metal tool.) <br>
ARCTURUS: Doctor, you are our chairman. Do we go or stay? <br>
DOCTOR: I think it would be a tragedy if the conference were to break
up now. <br>
IZLYR: If we remain, we put ourselves at risk. <br>
DOCTOR: His Majesty deserves the opportunity to convince us, surely? <br>
ALPHA: But if we do decide to leave, are we free to go? <br>

PELADON: Of course. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't think that King Peladon would keep you here by force,
do you? <br>

PELADON: Why should I detain you? <br>
ARCTURUS: As pawns in some political game, perhaps? <br>

PELADON: There is no plot! I am being completely honest with you.
Please, stay and help me to help my people. <br>

will let you know our decision as soon as possible. <br>

leave us. <br>

PELADON: Do you believe me? <br>
JO: I'm only an observer. It's up to the committee to decide whether or
not to help you. <br>
PELADON: I'm talking from a personal point of view. I don't often get
the chance. <br>
JO: Being a king is no fun? <br>
PELADON: It's very lonely. But you must know that. It's so hard to find
someone to talk to as a person. <br>
JO: But you have Hepesh. He seems very fond of you, just like a father.
<br>
PELADON: Hepesh is an old man, like your friend the Doctor. <br>
JO: I somehow don't think he'd care for that. <br>
PELADON: I was brought up by wise old men. I hardly ever see anyone
young or beautiful. My mother was an Earth woman, so you see, there is
a bond between us. Do you believe me? <br>
(Peladon takes Jo's hand and gazes into her eyes.) <br>
JO: Yes. Yes, I believe you. <br>
PELADON: Then speak for me to the commission. Make them see my case. <br>
JO: I see. All you want is a political ally. <br>
PELADON: No, I want you as a friend. <br>

been merciful to his enemies. But now the hour for mercy has passed.
Now an evil influence comes between King Peladon and his true destiny.
It must be destroyed. Aggedor will give his blessing. I dedicate you to
the destruction of the King's enemy, to purge the soul of Peladon by

trying to colonise the planet Earth, and Peladon is very like Earth. <br>
JO: Hmm. But they say they're here for the same reason as the other

are raised and Grun attacks. They trade swings, then the Doctor falls
back onto a log. Grun swings his pike, the Doctor dodges and the metal
pike head is firmly stuck in the wood. Technically, the Doctor has Grun
at his mercy, but Hepesh drops the Captain's sword down to him.) <br>
HEPESH: Grun! <br>

JO: And the things I found on the balcony and in Izlyr's room? <br>
DOCTOR: Planted by Hepesh, or one of his agents. <br>
PELADON: And the manifestation of Aggedor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's simple, your Majesty. Hepesh found that on a high
mountain a few still existed. So he captured one, trained it and kept
it hidden in the tunnels beneath the citadel, ready to pop out whenever
he needed a bit of haunting. <br>
PELADON: But why did he do all this? What did he hope to gain? <br>
DOCTOR: The entire planet of Peladon, or effective control of it, which
comes to the same thing. <br>
PELADON: And Arcturus? <br>
IZLYR: His planet lacks mineral deposits. Peladon has them in
abundance. <br>
DOCTOR: That's why he wanted to make sure that Peladon did not enter
the Galactic Federation. You see, he'd already made a private secret
alliance with Hepesh. <br>
ALPHA: Extremely unethical! Fortunately the scheme has been foiled, so
all is well. <br>

DOCTOR: But Hepesh is still very much alive. <br>

still does. He firmly believes that entering the Galactic Federation
would mean slavery and he'd go to any lengths to stop you joining. <br>

DOCTOR: Accuse the Ice Warriors of murdering Arcturus. <br>
IZLYR: Yes, Mars and the world of Arcturus are old enemies. That would
mean war. <br>

take sides and <br>

PELADON: There will be no punishments. The memory of this unhappy day
shall be wiped from our history. <br>
CAPTAIN: Your Majesty.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Come on, Jo. Follow me. I've got a nice
surprise for you. <br>
JO: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You wait and see. You ready? <br>
JO: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: All right then.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Delegate's conference room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Right, take a look at this. <br>
JO: The Tardis! Wow! <br>
DOCTOR: Some of Peladon's stout lads heaved here up the mountainside
for us. <br>
JO: Is she all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, never better. I told you the Tardis was indestructible. <br>
JO: Well, I hope it gets us back to Earth this time. <br>
DOCTOR: So do I, Jo. So do I. <br>
JO: Is there any doubt? <br>
DOCTOR: You don't really think that our appearance on the planet of
Peladon at this precise crisis in their history was just coincidence,
do you? <br>
JO: Time Lords again. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. <br>
JO: Ah, you didn't beat them after all. <br>
DOCTOR: No, not yet, but I will, Jo. Just give me time. Still, now
we've done what they wanted us to do, I suppose they'll whip us
straight back to Earth. <br>
JO: At least we get to see a real coronation before we go, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's true. You know, I haven't seen a coronation since
Elizabeth the first's. Or was it Queen Victoria? <br>
JO: Name dropper. <br>
(Aggedor enters.) <br>
JO: Oh! <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry. It's only Aggedor. <br>
JO: Phew! <br>
DOCTOR: The trouble is he seems to have grown rather fond of me. He
keeps following me about. Hello, Aggedor. <br>
JO: Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a good chap. All right, down, Aggedor. Down boy, down!
I think I'd better go and lock him up. <br>
JO: Yes, please. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. Come on, Aggedor. <br>
(Peladon enters as the Doctor and Aggedor leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty. Easy, Aggedor. That's it. Come on, this way. <br>
JO: Hello. Oughtn't you to be getting ready for the big occasion? <br>
PELADON: I wanted to see you first, to ask you to stay. <br>
JO: But I can't. <br>
PELADON: Why can't you? <br>
JO: Don't ask me for reasons. You wouldn't believe them. <br>
PELADON: I need you. <br>
JO: But you don't understand. I'm not even a real Princess. <br>
PELADON: That doesn't matter. <br>
JO: Oh, Peladon, I'm very, very fond of you, but I can't stay. Really. <br>
PELADON: Well look, I must go now. I'll talk to you again after the
coronation. I shan't give up, you know? I shall go on asking. <br>
(Jo kisses Peladon. The Doctor enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty. Oh, excuse me sire, but your court officials are
in a state of considerable panic. <br>
PELADON: Oh, yes, of course. I must go. Your Highness? <br>
JO: Goodbye. <br>
PELADON: Doctor. <br>
(Peladon leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, we'll just see the ceremony and slip quietly away, all
right? <br>
JO: Yes. Fine. <br>
DOCTOR: Jo? You do want to come back? <br>
JO: I think I'd better, don't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. In any case, I wouldn't like to lose you. Shall we
join the procession? <br>
JO: Yes!

AMAZONIA: I'm telling you, my good fellow, I am the official Earth

ALPHA: But the Doctor is the accredited Earth delegate. <br>
AMAZONIA: Doctor? What Doctor? Doctor who? <br>
(The Doctor and Jo go back around the corner.) <br>
IZLYR [OC]: The Doctor and the Princess Josephine. <br>
DOCTOR: Pity about that. I rather wanted to see that coronation. <br>
JO: Never mind. We could always go to Queen Victoria's. <br>
IZLYR [OC]: Yes. <br>
ALPHA [OC]: You must have heard of Princess Josephine! <br>
DOCTOR: Queen Victoria's? I've already seen Queen Victoria's. JO: I
haven't. Let's go again. <br>
AMAZONIA [OC]: They're obviously imposters! <br>
DOCTOR: All right. <br>
ALPHA [OC]: I do not understand. <br>
AMAZONIA: Where are they now? <br>
IZLYR: I think they were in the delegate's conference room. Come, I
will take you there.
