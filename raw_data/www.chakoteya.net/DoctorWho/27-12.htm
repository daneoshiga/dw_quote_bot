DOCTOR: What is it? What's happening? <br>
(The Doctor falls out of a small spinning cupboard.) <br>
LYNDA: Oh, my God! I don't believe it! Why'd they put you in there?
They never said you were coming. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened? I was. <br>
LYNDA: Careful now. Oh! Oh, mind yourself! Oh, that's the transmat. It
scrambles your head. I was sick for days. All right? So, what's your
name then, sweetheart? <br>

DOCTOR: Chosen for what? <br>
LYNDA: You're a housemate. You're in the house. Isn't that brilliant?! <br>

STROOD: That's not fair. We've got eviction in five minutes! I've been
here for all nine weeks, I've followed the rules, I haven't had a
single warning, and then he comes swanning in. <br>

CROSBIE: If they keep changing the rules, I'm going to protest, I am.

out for us. <br>
ZU-ZANA: I don't know. He's sort of handsome. Has a good lantern jaw. <br>
TRINE-E: Lantern jaws are so last year. <br>

Jack lying on an examination couch. There is a rack of clothes nearby.)

JACK: Sorry, but, nice to meet you, ladies, but where exactly am I? <br>
TRINE-E: We're giving you a brand new image. <br>
JACK: Oh, hold on, I was with the Doctor. Why, is there something wrong
with what I'm wearing? <br>
ZU-ZANA: It's all very twentieth century. Where did you get that denim?
<br>
JACK: A little place in Cardiff. It was called the Top Shop. <br>
ZU-ZANA: Ah! Design classic. <br>
TRINE-E: But we're going to have to find you some new colours. Maybe
get rid of that Oklahoma Farm Boy thing you've got going on. <br>
ZU-ZANA: Just stand still and let the Defabricator work its magic. <br>
JACK: What's a defabricator? <br>
(It's a beam that disintegrates all, yes all, your clothes.) <br>
JACK: Okay. Defabricator. Does exactly what it says on the tin. Am I
naked in front of millions of viewers? <br>

DOCTOR: What about this? <br>

LYNDA: Oh, that's exoglass. You'd need a nuclear bomb to get through. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't tempt me. <br>
LYNDA: I know you're not supposed to talk about the outside world, but
you must've been watching. Do people like me? Lynda. Lynda with a Y,
not Linda with an I. She got forcibly evicted because she damaged the
camera. Am I popular? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't remember. <br>
LYNDA: Oh, but does that mean I'm nothing? Some people get this far
just because they're insignificant. Doesn't anybody notice me? <br>
DOCTOR: No, you're, you're nice. You're sweet. Everybody thinks you're
sweet. <br>
LYNDA: Oh, is that right? Is that what I am? Oh, no one's ever told me
that before. Am I sweet? Really? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Dead sweet. <br>
LYNDA: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a wall. Isn't there supposed to be a garden out there or
something? <br>
LYNDA: Don't be daft. No one's got a garden anymore. Who's got a
garden? Don't tell me you've got a garden. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I've just got the Tardis. I remember. <br>
LYNDA: That's the amnesia! So what happened? Where did they get you? <br>
DOCTOR: We'd just left Raxacoriofallapatorius. Then we went to Kyoto.
That's right, Japan in 1336, and we only just escaped.

DOCTOR: Oh, Lynda with a Y. Sweet little Lynda. It's worse than that.
I'm not just a passing traveller. No stupid little transmat gets inside
my ship. That beam was fifteen million times more powerful, which means
this isn't just a game. There's something else going on. <br>

tweak of President Schwarzenegger. <br>
JACK: Er, not sure about the vest. What about a little bit of colour to
lift it? <br>
ZU-ZANA: Absolutely not. Never wear black with colour. It makes the
colour look cheap and the black look boring. Now, let's talk jackets. <br>
JACK: I kind of like the first one. <br>
ZU-ZANA: No, that's a bit too much Hell's Angel. I think I like the

ROSE: Er, I think she got a few of the questions wrong, that's all. <br>
ANNE DROID: Oh, you'd know all about that. <br>
ROSE: Well, yeah, but I can't vote for myself, so it had to be Fitch.
I'm sorry, that's the game. That's how it works. I had to vote for
someone. <br>
(Fitch is in tears.) <br>
FITCH: Let me try again. It was the lights and everything. I couldn't
think. <br>
ANNE DROID: In fact, with three answers wrong, Broff was the weakest
link in that round, but it's votes that count. <br>
FITCH: I'm sorry. Please. Oh God, help me! <br>

DOCTOR: A hundred years exactly. It's the year two zero zero one zero

broadcasting news channels back then. Had a bit of trouble upstairs.
Nothing too serious. Easy. Gave them a hand, home in time for tea. <br>
LYNDA: A hundred years ago? What, you were here a hundred years ago? <br>
DOCTOR: Yep! <br>
LYNDA: You're looking good on it. <br>
DOCTOR: I moisturise. Funny sorts of readings. All kinds of energy. The

LYNDA: I don't know. I think we're the first ever contestants to get
outside. <br>
DOCTOR: I had two friends travelling with me. They must've got caught
in the same transmat. Where would they be? <br>
LYNDA: I don't know. They could've been allocated anywhere. There's a
hundred different games. <br>
DOCTOR: Like what? <br>
LYNDA: Well, there's ten floors of Big Brother. There's a different
House behind each of those doors. And then beyond that, there's all
sorts of shows. It's non stop. There's Call My Bluff, with real guns.
Countdown, where you've got thirty seconds to stop the bomb going off.
Ground Force, which is a nasty one. You get turned into compost. Er,
Wipeout, speaks for itself. Oh, and Stars In Their Eyes. Literally,
stars in their eyes. If you don't sing, you get blinded. <br>

LYNDA: Well, it does to me. I've just put my life in your hands. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm just a traveller, wandering past. Believe it or not, all
I'm after is a quiet life. <br>
LYNDA: So, if we get out of here, what're you going to do? Just wander
off again? <br>
DOCTOR: Fast as I can. <br>
LYNDA: So, I could come with you? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe you could. <br>
LYNDA: I wouldn't get in the way. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't mind if you did. Not a bad idea, Lynda with a Y. But
first of all, we've
got to concentrate on the getting out. And to do that, you've got to
