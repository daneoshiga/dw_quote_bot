</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A long, silver weather balloon has brought its
payload to earth by the edge of a lake, and a man carrying a shotgun
finds it. Meanwhile, a Land Rover comes over the bridge at the entrance
to the Minsbridge Wild Life Sanctuary and heads for the warden's lodge.
A woman comes out to meet it.) <br>
MRS OLLIS: Doctor Tyler, is it? <br>
TYLER: Yeah. Sorry to be a trouble. Thanks very much for calling. <br>
MRS OLLIS: Arthur's keeping an eye on it, down by the lake. He hasn't
touched it. <br>
TYLER: Oh good. <br>
MRS OLLIS: It's not chemicals, is it? Only the birds, you see. <br>
TYLER: No, you'll be all right. Nothing to worry about.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lake side]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The orange payload is clearly marked with Doctor
Tyler's name and contact details at Wessex University, and the word
Reward in three languages. As the Land Rover drives round the side of
the lake towards Arthur Ollis, the box starts make a crackling sound.
There is a flash, and Ollis vanishes. The birds take off from the lake
in fright. Tyler arrives and looks around for Ollis.) <br>
TYLER: Mister Ollis! Mister Ollis? <br>
(Tyler goes back to his Land Rover and gets on the radio.) <br>
TYLER: Put me through to UNIT HQ will you, please?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[UNIT Laboratory]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Jo brings in a tray of drinks.) <br>
TYLER: So there you are. Mrs Ollis says her husband's down there, I see
him wave, get there and there he is, gone. So I got in touch with you
lot. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well quite right too. That's what we're here for, eh,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes of course. <br>
JO: What exactly is this machine for? <br>
TYLER: Cosmic Ray Research, Miss Grant. <br>
JO: And you still use balloons? <br>
TYLER: That's right. We may not be NASA, but we get the results. Inside
that is the most sophisticated Cosmic Ray Monitoring device between
here and Cape Kennedy. You see, I was going to get in touch with you
people anyway, even before this business. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh? Why was that? <br>
TYLER: Can you give me that briefcase, please? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. <br>
TYLER: Well, we've been getting some pretty funny results on these
latest tests. Now this is the first one you see. Ah, this is normal. <br>
(Tyler hands the Doctor an x-ray picture.) <br>
TYLER: Now then, this is why I'm here. Last week's test. Now, look at
that. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Good grief. <br>
(The second image is very narrow compared to the first.) <br>
TYLER: Yeah. Nobody knows what to make of it. Well, they've all seen
it. Yanks, and the other lot. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh? <br>
TYLER: Now here somewhere, oh yes. Now this is what really put the tin
hat on it. From that deep space monitor Houston put up. Just take a
look at those readings. <br>
(Tyler shows a large printout to the Brigadier.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Er, the Doctor's the <br>
TYLER: What? <br>
BRIGADIER: The Doctor's the man you <br>
TYLER: Oh, I see. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Well, it's travelling faster than light. <br>
TYLER: Yes. And it can't, can it. I don't know what to make of it. It's
come all that way, through millions of star systems. It must have been
directed, and it must have been directed at us. Now why? <br>
DOCTOR: Why indeed, Professor Tyler, why indeed. <br>
BRIGADIER: Thing is, Doctor, is there anything I can do? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Pass me a silicon rod will you? <br>
(The rod is passed from the Brigadier to Tyler to Jo to the Doctor, who
stirs his drink with it.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, what I meant was, is there anything that UNIT can do
about this space lightning business? <br>
DOCTOR: Lightning? Yes, I suppose it could look like lightning, only it
isn't. No. If there where such a thing I would say it was compressed
light. A sort of controlled superlucent emission. <br>
BRIGADIER: A what? <br>
JO: He means it travels faster than light. <br>
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Miss Grant. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, Professor, is this machine of yours functioning
properly? <br>
TYLER: Far as I can tell. Haven't developed that latest plate yet, of
course. <br>
DOCTOR: Then I suggest that you do so immediately and let me know the
result of your findings. Jo, you and I are going to take a look at the
scene of the crime. <br>
JO: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you'll find everything you need here. <br>
TYLER: Oh, right. Er, thanks. <br>
(The Doctor and Jo leave. Tyler takes the x-ray plate from the box and
starts using lab equipment.) <br>
TYLER: Oh, I can manage now, thank you. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm delighted to hear it. Make yourself at home. We're only
supposed to be a top secret security establishment. Liberty Hall,
Doctor Tyler. Liberty Hall. <br>
(The Brigadier leaves. Tyler checks his watch then gets the developed
image from the machine.) <br>
TYLER: That shouldn't happen. <br>
(He puts the image on a light box. It looks like a face contorted in
fear.) <br>
TYLER: That definitely shouldn't happen. <br>
(Tyler starts dismantling the box, and it begins crackling. There is a
flash, and Tyler has vanished. Then some red and blue energy creeps out
of the box onto the bench.)

MRS OLLIS: This here's the place all right. <br>
JO: Are you sure, Mrs Ollis? <br>
MRS OLLIS: Well, the Land Rover tracks stop here, don't they? I told
you, you're too late. The other gentleman's been and gone. <br>
DOCTOR: You haven't seen your husband since this morning? <br>
MRS OLLIS: No. Nothing unusual in that. Oh, he'll be off somewhere. We
shan't see him now until dark. I'll look for him if you like. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, it's not important. <br>
MRS OLLIS: Please yourself. I'll be getting on then. <br>
(Mrs Ollis walks off.) <br>
JO: It is important, isn't it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Jo. Yes, it's much more important than I thought.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: Doctor Tyler, these reports might
interest <br>
(The Brigadier realises the room is empty.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Tyler? Doctor Tyler? Sergeant Benton! <br>
(Benton enters.) <br>
BENTON: Sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor Tyler appears to be wandering around UNIT Head
Quarters. Go and find him and bring him here at once. <br>
BENTON: Yes, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Behind UNIT HQ]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The top secret HQ is actually well advertised. The
notice in front of the Denham Manor clearly states Ministry of Defence
U.N.I.T. Headquarters Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart No Unauthorised
Entry - without a guard to be seen. The Doctor and Jo drive round the
back to the garage area and park up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, let's see what Doctor Tyler's found out about that
plate. <br>
JO: What's that? <br>
(A bright red and blue something is coming out of the drain in the
middle of the area.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jo! Back slowly away behind the car. Do as I say! <br>
(The thing is growing.) <br>
JO: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: When I tell you to run, you run. Right, run! <br>
(They run for the shrubbery as there is a flash and Bessie vanishes.
The Doctor and Jo peer out from behind a tree.) <br>
JO: What happened? What is that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
(The Thing goes back down the drain.) <br>
JO: Poor old Bessie. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, Come on.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[UNIT Laboratory]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Benton enters.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, where is he? <br>
BENTON: Sorry sir, we just couldn't find him. Doctor Tyler has just
disappeared. We've searched the grounds and the buildings, sir, and
there's no sign of him. Oh, and there was an explosion in the garage,
sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Explosion? What explosion? I heard nothing. <br>
(The Doctor and Jo enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, you wouldn't, Brigadier. <br>
BENTON: But there was a flash, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: A flash, yes, not an explosion. It was a release of kinetic
energy. <br>
BRIGADIER: One of Bessie's gadgets misfire? <br>
JO: It's far more serious than that, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: You'd better check, Benton. <br>
BENTON: Right, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: No. I shouldn't go anywhere near it. Not just at the moment. <br>
BENTON: What shall I do, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: I suggest that you put a guard on the drains, Benton. <br>
BENTON: The drains? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the drains! <br>
BRIGADIER: Put the men on stand by, Benton. <br>
BENTON: Right away, sir. <br>
(Benton leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: All right, Brigadier. Now then, what's the situation as you see
it? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, I've just had a call from Mrs Ollis. Her husband
hasn't returned. <br>
JO: Oh, no. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I was rather afraid that might happen. <br>
BRIGADIER: We're cooperating with the local Police, but we have got
fifteen hundred acres to cover. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I shouldn't bother going on looking for him, Brigadier. I
think you'll find that that's Mister Ollis. <br>
(The Doctor shows the Brigadier the new image.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Is this the plate that Tyler was developing when we left? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. <br>
BRIGADIER: When I came back with these satellite reports, Tyler had
disappeared and this box was open as it is now. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing's been moved? <br>
BRIGADIER: Nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me a minute, will you? <br>
BRIGADIER: Hmm. <br>
(The Brigadier and Jo stand back as the Doctor waves his Geiger counter
over the box. Background only until he gets to the sink and plug hole.)
<br>
DOCTOR: All right, Brigadier, go on. <br>
BRIGADIER: These are tracking reports and assessments from just about
every country in the world. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. It looks as if Tyler was right. That light beam or
whatever it is, seems to have scanned the Earth like a searchlight and
picked on us. <br>
BRIGADIER: Since UNIT is now in charge of this investigation, Doctor,
it would help if you were a little more forthcoming. <br>
JO: Tell him about Bessie, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Huh? Oh, yes. Well, Brigadier, now Bessie has disappeared. <br>
BRIGADIER: What? <br>
JO: But it was after us. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, but what was after you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, some kind of powerful organism thing with a very strong
hunting instinct. <br>
JO: It was hunting you, wasn't it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so. <br>
BRIGADIER: Are you trying to tell me that this whole thing has been
arranged just for your benefit? <br>
JO: Oh yes, that's right. You see that stuff simply ignored me as soon
as it saw the Doctor. <br>
BRIGADIER: What about this chap Ollis? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. Well, perhaps this thing was confused, or its
instructions weren't getting through. <br>
BRIGADIER: And Tyler? <br>
DOCTOR: Tyler? Yeah. Yes, that was its second mistake, here in this
laboratory where I usually work. And its third mistake was Bessie. <br>
JO: And you were in Bessie. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
BRIGADIER: And you think there's a link between the beam and this, this
organism thing. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. I think that that beam was the method it used to get
here. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, now it's arrived, and it's hostile, and it's still
here, so what do we do and how do we find it? <br>
DOCTOR: We don't find it, Brigadier. If we wait around here long
enough, it'll find us.

looking like snowmen made of red balls. Apparently these are called Gel
guards.) <br>
GUARD: Holy Moses! What's that? <br>
(The objects advance, growling.) <br>
GUARD: Get Sergeant Benton, quick! <br>
(The second soldier runs inside. Meanwhile, more of the objects appear
in the woodland around the buildings.) <br>
BENTON: How many of them? <br>
GUARD: I'm not sure, Sarge. They seem to be springing out all over the
place. <br>
BENTON: Right. You hold them off here, and I'll cover the back. Right,
you men come with me. Hurry. <br>
(Two soldiers stay with the guard.) <br>
GUARD: Fire at will! <br>
(Bullets have no effect. One object raises a claw-like hand and fires.
There's a big bang and just two soldiers retreat.)

BRIGADIER: What are those creatures? Where are they coming from? <br>
DOCTOR: Obviously from the same source as that organism thing. First
the scout, then the reinforcements. <br>
BRIGADIER: Their grasp of military tactics is very good. <br>
JO: Well, let's hope Sergeant Benton's are even better.

BENTON: Hurry, men, and keep your heads down. <br>
(The machine guns is soon destroyed. By a handy signpost to the
Laboratory and Stores, one of Benton's men fires a bazooka which seems
to stop one.) <br>
BENTON: Great shot, Johnson. <br>
(But it keeps coming. Benson reports in.) <br>
BENTON: Brigadier, do you read me? Over. <br>

everyone out of the building. Everybody. Now, move. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'd better see what's happening. You stay here, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Not much point in my going anywhere else is there? <br>

DOCTOR: I think you ought to get out of here too, Jo. <br>
JO: Not a chance. I'm staying right here with you. <br>
DOCTOR: Now please, Jo, do as I ask. They won't harm you. You ignore
them, they'll ignore you. I'm the one they're after. <br>

BENTON: Right, Jo, Doctor, have you seen the Brigadier? <br>
DOCTOR: Sergeant Benton. Just the man I wanted to see. Will you please
take Miss Grant with you? Even if you have to carry her. <br>
BENTON: I'm sorry, Doc, my orders were to report to the Brigadier. <br>

JO: You were going off without me, weren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Sergeant, aren't you going to say it that it's bigger on
the inside than it is on the outside. Everybody else does. <br>
BENTON: It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Anyway, nothing to do with you
surprises me anymore, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you for the complement. <br>
(The Doctor pulls a lever but there is only a thudddd sound. He tries
again.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not reacting. There's only one thing for it. I'll have to
send an SOS. I hate having to call them, but, there we are. <br>
JO: What were you planning to do, anyhow? <br>
DOCTOR: I was planning to lure that stuff away from Earth, Jo, but now
as it seems to have immobilised the Tardis, I'm not going anywhere.
We're trapped. <br>
JO: So what are we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: At least we can watch that thing in comfort, and then we can
send in a report and see what they have to say about it. <br>
BENTON: Who are they? <br>
JO: The Time Lords. Oh, things are pretty serious. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, they are. <br>

TIME LORD: We are giving his Tardis all the energy we can spare. <br>
PRESIDENT: And the hostile? <br>
TIME LORD: Unidentified so far, my lord. <br>
CHANCELLOR: And the source of this beam? <br>
(The Time Lord brings it up on his wall screen.) <br>
PRESIDENT: You see, Chancellor? The black hole. <br>
CHANCELLOR: That's a nowhere, no place, a void. According to all known
laws, nothing can exist there. <br>
PRESIDENT: Yet somehow, through this black hole, vital cosmic energy is
draining away in spite of all we can do to check it. <br>
CHANCELLOR: Already the time travel facility is in danger, my lord. <br>
PRESIDENT: Without it, we shall be helpless. Unless the energy loss is
stopped the whole fabric of space time will be destroyed. We are being
consumed and we can find no way to fight back. <br>
CHANCELLOR: Are you telling me we are up against an adversary, a force,
equal to our own? <br>
PRESIDENT: Equal and opposite to our own. <br>
CHANCELLOR: A force which inhabits a universe where by definition even
we cannot exist? <br>
PRESIDENT: Yes. A force in the universe of antimatter. <br>
CHANCELLOR: But that's too terrible to contemplate. Someone must go and
help the Doctor. <br>
PRESIDENT: I agree, but no one can be spared, your Excellency. Everyone
is needed to combat the energy drain. <br>
CHANCELLOR: Are you saying we can't help him? <br>
PRESIDENT: Yes, I am, but perhaps he can help himself. Show me the
Doctor's time stream, the section for his earlier self before he
changed his form. <br>
CHANCELLOR: You can't allow him to cross his own time stream. Apart
from the enormous energy it would need, the First Law of Time expressly
forbids him to meet his other selves. <br>
PRESIDENT: I am aware of that, your Excellency, but this is an
emergency. <br>
CHANCELLOR: But you can't! <br>

precise. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Oh no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, my dear, I hate to be contrary
but I can see he's a little bit confused, poor old chap, and I do feel
you should have the correct explanation. You don't mind, do you. <br>

mayn't I? You see, he is one of me. <br>

JO: Oh. <br>

DOCTOR: What about the First Law of Time? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Perhaps I could explain? <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps you could. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Well, our fellow Time Lords out there are just as much under
siege as we are. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
DOCTOR 2: And they couldn't send anyone to help you. But they did
summon up enough temporal energy to lift me out of my bit of our time
stream and pop me down here, into my own future, so to speak. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
DOCTOR 2: My dear fellow, you are being a bit dim, aren't you? Your
effectiveness is now doubled! <br>
DOCTOR: Halved, more like. <br>

during the Yeti business, and then later when the Cybermen invaded? <br>

What is more, by permitting the Doctor to meet his other selves, you
have transgressed the first and most important law of time. <br>
TIME LORD: I know that, your Excellency, but this is an emergency. <br>
CHANCELLOR: No emergency can justify this transgression. This operation

opposite to our own. <br>
CHANCELLOR: But the first law of time must be obeyed! <br>

succeed we shall lose our time travel facility and become as vulnerable

DOCTOR: Don't you understand? You were both brought here by accident.
Your only chance of getting back lies in my persuading whoever brought
you here to send you home. <br>
TYLER: I prefer to take a chance on my own. How about you, Miss Grant?
Are you coming with me? <br>
JO: No. No, I'll stick with the Doctor, thank you. <br>
TYLER: Looks like I'll have to go on my own then. <br>

can persuade our host to send you back. <br>

abandoned. Many thousands of years ago, when I left our planet, all
this was then a star until I arranged its detonation. <br>

in your world and mine. It brought you here and imbued you with its

TYLER: But that's just a theory. <br>
JO: Oh look, Doctors, what are you talking about? And simple answers,
please. One at a time this time. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Well, singularity is a point in space time which can exist
only inside a black hole. We are in a black hole, in a world of
antimatter very close to this point of singularity, where all the known
physical laws cease to exist. Now, Omega has got control of singularity
and has learned to use the vast forces locked up inside the black hole.
<br>
DOCTOR: Now, that is how Omega is able to create the world we are now
living in by a fantastic effort of his will, but unfortunately he
thinks he's been wronged by the Time Lords. <br>
TYLER: Time Lords? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and now he's hell bent on revenge. <br>
JO: Well, you'll just have to stop him, won't you. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Well, the trouble is, we're not sure we can. <br>
BENTON: Well, who is this Omega, anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: A Time Lord. One of the greatest of all my race. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Our race. <br>
DOCTOR: Our race. Yes, sorry. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Long, long ago, we learnt the secret of time travel, but in
order to make it a reality we had to have a colossal source of energy. <br>
DOCTOR: Omega provided that energy by a fantastic feat of solar
engineering. We thought he was destroyed, instead of which he finished
up here. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, it seems that his imprisonment was the price of our
freedom to travel in time. <br>
JO: Even so, you can't let him smash everything up. Well, look, he's
not all-powerful, you know, or else why did he need to bring you here? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true. <br>
BENTON: There must be something you can do to get us out of here? <br>
JO: What about your sonic screwdriver? <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's useless in this world. The only natural law here is
the law of Omega's will. <br>
JO: Omega's will. Look, if Omega can will up an entire world, well
surely you two could will up a small door. Well look, you're a Time
Lord, aren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
JO: In fact, you're two Time Lords. Well, surely your wills combined
are a match for his? Why else do you think the High Council wanted the
two of you here? <br>

DOCTOR 2: (sotto) We'll have to risk that. That temper is his only

OMEGA: What are you saying? Do you plot against me? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. I was just explaining to my associate here that he
should show you more respect, for both our sakes. <br>
DOCTOR 2: I am thoroughly repentant. You mentioned some task. <br>
OMEGA: Yes. I created this world through the power of my will. I
created the organisms which brought you here. This is the source of the
light stream you travelled along, and I created it. I alone! Omega! And
it is not enough. None of it is enough. I am still trapped. As trapped
as I was the moment I arrived in this, this desolation. Huh. Ironic, is
it not? <br>
DOCTOR 2: But surely, if you can transmit matter to Earth down that
light stream, you could transmit yourself anywhere. <br>
OMEGA: Yes, so I imagined, but no, there was no way out. No escape. <br>
DOCTOR: But why? <br>
OMEGA: So long as I control singularity, I can make it do my will. All
these things exist because I will them to exist. Without me and the
unceasing pressure of my will, the work of thousands of years would
collapse into chaos in microseconds. I am, if you like, the Atlas of my
world. <br>
DOCTOR: So, the moment you abandon control, you cannot escape, and you
cannot escape without abandoning control. <br>
OMEGA: Exactly. I am a prisoner of my own power, my own creation. Or
rather, I was, until now. And that is your task. To take over my burden
so that I may escape. <br>
(Bessie is dodging Gel weapons fire as the two Doctors confer.) <br>
OMEGA: Well? Your answer? <br>
DOCTOR: We will obey you, Omega. <br>
DOCTOR 2: We have no choice. <br>
OMEGA: Then you help me make my preparations. You must first remove
this mask. Now you, too, will need such masks. The light stream has a
slow, corrosive effect, due to the acceleration of the particles, but
you are in no immediate danger. The process takes time. Come, the mask.
<br>
(They slowly lift the face plate of the mask. It creaks on its hinge
and they see the face of Omega.) <br>

(Jon pushes the face plate back down.) <br>
OMEGA: What are you doing? I am in haste to be gone! <br>
DOCTOR 2: We, we cannot remove the mask, Omega, because. <br>
DOCTOR: Because beneath that mask there is nothing left of you. The
corrosion has already done its work. <br>
OMEGA: What? <br>
(Omega goes to a mirror in the wall and removes the mask completely. We
look straight through him to Jon and Patrick standing behind.) <br>
DOCTOR: You exist only because your will insists that you exist. Your
will is all that is left of you. <br>
(Omega puts the mask back on and doubles over, howling.) <br>
OMEGA: It is not true. I am Omega, creator of this world! And I can
also destroy! Therefore I must exist! <br>

things shall be destroyed! All things! All things! <br>

DOCTOR: And when Omega knocked it out of our hands and it fell out of
the force field, all the atoms and the anti-atoms annihilated one
another. <br>
TYLER: So, big bang, and the black hole becomes a supernova! <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Pity, though. I think it had a lovely tone. <br>
DOCTOR 1 [OC]: Everything okay? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Well, here we are, back safe and sound. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Quite a party. <br>
DOCTOR 1 [on scanner]: Yes, well, the party's over now. You young men
and I go back to our time zones. Though considering the way things have
been going, well, I shudder to think what you'll do with out me. <br>
(William's picture fades for the last time.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Goodbye. Well, goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. It's been so nice
to meet me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. I hope I don't meet me again. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Ah. <br>
(Patrick takes a step back, and waves as he disappears.) <br>
TYLER: Now I've seen it all. <br>
JO: Pity. He was so sweet. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, wasn't I? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, as far as I'm concerned, Doctor, one of you is
enough. More than enough. Sergeant Benton! <br>
BENTON: Sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: You and I'd better make a full inventory of the HQ. Make
sure everything's back in place. It's all got to be accounted for, you
know. <br>
BENTON: Sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes? <br>
BENTON: Well, excuse me, sir, but, well, if anything is missing, where
do we say it's gone? <br>
BRIGADIER: Come along, Benton. <br>
(The Brigadier and Benton leave.) <br>
TYLER: Well, I think I'd better be on my way, too. Thank you for a
fascinating trip, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye. <br>
TYLER: Goodbye. Goodbye, Jo. <br>
JO: Goodbye. <br>
TYLER: I don't think I'll write it up in the University journal, not if
I want to keep my job. <br>
(Tyler leaves.) <br>
JO: What's the matter, Doctor? Everything worked out all right, didn't
it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, for us. <br>
JO: I know what it is. It's because you had to trick Omega. <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't exactly trick him. I promised him his freedom and I
gave it to him. The only freedom he could ever have. <br>
JO: What else could you do? It was either him or everything. <br>
(There is a materialisation sound, and a caltrop shaped circuit appears
on the time rotor.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Time Lords! Look, they've sent me a new dematerialisation
circuit. And my knowledge of time travel law and all the
dematerialisation codes, they've all come back. They've forgiven me.
They've given me back my freedom. <br>
JO: I suppose you'll be rushing off, then. <br>
DOCTOR: No, not straight away, Jo. Of course not. I've got to build a
new force field generator first. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MRS OLLIS: And where do you think you've been,
Arthur Ollis? I've been worried sick about you, I have. Everybody's
been searching. Where have you been? Soldiers looking for you. You
didn't come home for your dinner. Well? <br>
OLLIS: You'd never believe me, woman. Supper ready? </font> </p>
