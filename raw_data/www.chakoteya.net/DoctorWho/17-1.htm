<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is examining a bit of K9.) <br>
DOCTOR: What a brain. Oh ho. What a brain. <br>
(K9 coughs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Do that again. Say Ah. <br>
K9: (croaky) Ah. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Ah, laryngitis. How can a robot catch laryngitis? I mean,
what do you need it for, hmm? Romana! Laryngitis? <br>
ROMANA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Romana, the dog's got laryngitis. <br>
(Princess Astra of Atrios enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, I thought you were Romana. Have you seen her? What are
you doing here? <br>
ROMANA: Regenerating. Do you like it? <br>
DOCTOR: Regenerating? What are you talking about, regenerating? Only
Time Lords regenerate. Look, it's awfully nice to see you, Princess
Astra <br>
ROMANA: Romana. <br>
DOCTOR: Romana? Ah. <br>
K9: Ah. <br>
DOCTOR: Shut up, K9. What are you doing in that body? <br>
ROMANA: Regenerating. Do you like it? <br>
DOCTOR: But you can't wear that body. <br>
ROMANA: I thought it looked very nice on the Princess. <br>
DOCTOR: But you can't go round wearing copies of bodies. <br>
ROMANA: Why not? We're not going back to Atrios, are we? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
ROMANA: Well, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, go and try another one. Go on. <br>
ROMANA: All right. <br>
(Romana leaves. The Doctor goes back to trying to fix K9.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's the trouble here? Preoccupation with external
appearances. <br>
ROMANA: I quite like this one but its a bit short. <br>
(It's also very blue.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, lengthen it then. Go on. Trying to look like other people.<br>
(Romana reenters as a voluptuous brunette in belly dancer gear.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's just not important, is it, K9. (looks up) No thank you.
Not today. It's what's on the inside that matters. That's what's
important, isn't it, K9? Do you agree with me, K9? <br>
(The Doctor looks up to an eight foot Greek goddess.) <br>
DOCTOR: Too tall. Take it away. Now, listen. You listen to me in there.
What you want is something warm and sensible. Something that will wear
well. Something with a bit of style and, well, style. You know. <br>
(Romana walks in dressed just like the Doctor, complete with scarf and
hat pulled down nearly to her nose.) <br>
ROMANA: How about this, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly! Good heavens, that's exactly right. Ha! I never
realised you had such a sense of style. <br>
ROMANA: I thought you said external appearances weren't important. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, but it's nice to get them right, though, isn't it. <br>
ROMANA: Ah, but it's what's inside that counts. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
(The Doctor takes her hat off to reveal - Astra.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
ROMANA: Don't you like it? I think it'll do very nicely. The arms are a
bit long. I can always take them in. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, the arms are just fine. They're just fine. It's
just that, oh well, all right, have it your own way. But get rid of
those silly clothes, eh? <br>
ROMANA: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. It depends on the randomiser. <br>
ROMANA: Let me know when we get there. <br>
(The Tardis materialises in the opening to a large cave in Winspit
Quarry, Worth Maltravers, Dorset.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've arrived. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I said, we've arrived. We got there. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: What's the place like? <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? Oh, breathable atmosphere. High degree of seismic activity.
<br>
ROMANA [OC]: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Lots of earthquakes. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: Oh, seismic. I thought you said psychic. <br>
DOCTOR: Sidekick? <br>
ROMANA [OC]: Like it? I haven't seen it yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, if you want to talk to me, will you come in here and do
it, please? <br>
ROMANA [OC]: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind. <br>
(Romana enters in pink trouser suit with knee high boots and white
scarf. The Doctor doesn't look up from the console.) <br>
ROMANA: There, what do you think? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's fine, that's fine. Here, take a couple of those,
will you? <br>
(He gives her some pills.) <br>
ROMANA: What are they for? <br>
DOCTOR: Anti-radiation pills. The levels are quite high out here.
Here's a bleeper that'll bleep when you need the next dose. <br>
ROMANA: Right, let's see where we are. <br>
(They turn on the scanner.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh look, rocks. <br>
(And turn it off again.) <br>
ROMANA: Let's go. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Got to do something with K9. <br>
(The Doctor puts the module he was working on back in and K9 starts
spinning round. He takes it out again.) <br>
DOCTOR: You know the most important thing my cybernetics tutor ever
taught me? <br>
ROMANA: No, what? <br>
DOCTOR: When replacing a brain, always make sure the arrow A is
pointing to the front. Did you get that? Arrow A <br>
ROMANA: To the front. <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis is perched on a just slightly larger
than Tardis sized slab of limestone.) <br>
ROMANA: Not the most inviting planet. What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. A feeling I've been here before. <br>
ROMANA: Déjà vu? <br>
DOCTOR: Oui. <br>
(He jumps down via other slabs.) <br>
ROMANA: There's something you recognise? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing tangible. I just have a sensation. A pervading air of.
Can you feel it too? <br>
ROMANA: Shall we go back inside? <br>
DOCTOR: What, and never know where I've been until the end of time? I
wouldn't sleep at night. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ruins]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Interesting. <br>
ROMANA: Precious stones? <br>
DOCTOR: Very precious. In a geological sense, more precious than
diamonds, but I'd need a bigger bit. Ah ha! Ha ha! I was right. <br>
ROMANA: How modest. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, see what you make of it. <br>
(Romana wipes her finger on the stone and tastes it.) <br>
ROMANA: A composite material. Gravel in a binding of possibly limestone
and clay. <br>
DOCTOR: Limestone and clay making? <br>
ROMANA: Add water, cement. <br>
DOCTOR: Add gravel. <br>
ROMANA: Concrete. <br>
DOCTOR: You know something? You've got all the makings of a first class
navvy. Concrete. Manufactured. <br>
(They move on a bit to some ruined buildings where a metal pipe sticks
up incongruously.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look! The ruins of a city? <br>
(Romana shrugs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
(The ground shakes slightly.) <br>
ROMANA: Doctor. Those tremors. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
ROMANA: Could they have destroyed it? Seems to be coming from over
there. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go this way. <br>
(Further on are pieces of fallen metalwork and a large flexible pipe.
The sound is rising in pitch.) <br>
ROMANA: I wonder what could have caused it? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't know. Something fairly serious by the look of it. <br>
(Things are shaking a lot now, and the sound is rising still like an
engine revving for takeoff. Small stones jump around their feet. They
run away a short distance.) <br>
DOCTOR: It seemed to be coming from right under our feet. <br>
(The noise drops in pitch.) <br>
ROMANA: It sounded like drilling. What do you think it way? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Underworld dentist? Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quarry]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A stonefall alerts the Doctor and Romana to other
lifeforms coming round the cliff edge. They hide in a cave. A group of
humanoids in dusty but colourful robes come, four men carrying a litter
with a body on it, and a woman leading, then a small group behind. They
go to the edge of the cliff and put down the litter.) <br>
DOCTOR: Let's get closer. <br>
(The body is wearing some sort of uniform. The mourning party take it
off the litter and start piling stones on top of it. Finally one of
them scratches marks on a large flat slab.) <br>
ROMANA: A strange custom. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you try digging a hole through rock. <br>
ROMANA: Like the living dead. <br>
DOCTOR: What? The living dead? You mean a planet ruled by zombies? I
want to know who lives on this planet. With one basic difference, the
living are very much like the dead. Who was it said the living are just
the dead on holiday? Never mind. You should meet one. You can always
tell a genuine zombie. <br>
ROMANA: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Skin is cold to the touch. I want to get a closer look at that
body. <br>
ROMANA: They've gone! I'll keep watch. <br>
(The Doctor starts to remove the rocks from the grave. The corpse is
wearing a plastic covered ID tag. He goes over to Romana. She jumps
when he touches her shoulder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. Sorry, did I startle you? <br>
ROMANA: Yes, you did. What did you find out? <br>
DOCTOR: The deceased was a combat pilot serving with the Third Galactic
Fleet of the planet Kantra. <br>
ROMANA: Kantra? Kantra's a tropical paradise. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: What's a Kantrian doing dying here? <br>
DOCTOR: What's very odd, he died of exhaustion and malnutrition. <br>
ROMANA: It's not surprising in a place like this. <br>
DOCTOR: Except, wouldn't you have expected him to have died of
radiation first? <br>
ROMANA: Look! <br>
(A shiny little spacecraft is coming in to land. Very similar to the
UFO's in UFO, actually) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's not a flying saucer. <br>
(Quick relocate to Binnegar Heath sand pit near Wareham for the landing
site.) <br>
DOCTOR: Recognise the type? <br>
ROMANA: Not specifically. Judging by design and size I'd say it had
intergalactic range and time warp capability. Origin almost certainly
star system 4X alpha 4. <br>
(The craft lands on its point.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, without reference to my Jane's Spacecraft of the
Universe, I wouldn't dispute that. <br>
(The pointed lower half of the craft begins to spin on its own.) <br>
ROMANA: What's it doing now? I've never seen anything like that before.
<br>
(The spacecraft beings to drill a hole in the ground.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, interesting technique. Camouflage and defence. <br>
ROMANA: For a place that looked dead, there's a lot going on. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, probably hit it at the beginning of the tourist season.
How far away would you say that was? <br>
ROMANA: About a mile. <br>
(The spacecraft has almost completely buried itself.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's just about the distance for a good bracing walk. <br>
ROMANA: What, we're going down there? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, it would be less than gracious not to welcome them.
We can pretend we're couriers. Come on. <br>
(A hatch opens in the remaining visible part of the spacecraft as the
Doctor and Romana make their way towards it. Then something goes Bang!
in the sand nearby, and another, and another. They run away back to the
ruins. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, this way. <br>
(The explosions get closer as they dash into a building.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Building]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They run down some steps into a wrecked room with
some technical equipment in it covered in dust.) <br>
ROMANA: These explosions, where are they coming from? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Got it. Underground drilling. <br>
ROMANA: Why explosions? <br>
DOCTOR: High impact phason drills. <br>
ROMANA: Here? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, someone's imported some high technology. <br>
(An explosion close by nearly brings the roof down on Romana.) <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, look out! <br>
(The Doctor gets trapped under a falling column and is knocked out.) <br>
ROMANA: Doctor! <br>
(She can't move the piece of masonry.) <br>
DOCTOR: Can't a fellow get any sleep around here? <br>
ROMANA: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, I can't see all of me. My extremities seem
unimpaired, but I'm being squashed. Can you take some of the weight? <br>
ROMANA: No, I can't move it. Without this block, you'd have been
flattened. You're lucky. <br>
DOCTOR: We're not going to move this without help. K9 could do it if he
was in one piece. I've got my <br>
ROMANA: I'll be as quick as I can. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
ROMANA: Will you be all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Who knows? <br>
ROMANA: Don't go away, will you. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd rather hoped you'd resist the temptation to say that. Don't
forget the arrow. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: A to the front! <br>
(She runs off through the ruins. The Doctor reaches into his inside
coat pocket and takes out a paperback book to read.) <br>
DOCTOR: Origins of the Universe. <br>
(By Oolon Colluphid.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ha, ha. He got it wrong on the first line! Tut. Why didn't he
ask someone who saw it happen? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Romana is being followed. She trips and falls,
then a series of explosions happen between her and the Tardis. When
they stop, the way into the Tardis is blocked by fallen stone.) <br>
ROMANA: K9! <br>
(Her radiation pill timer beeps.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Building]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (So does the Doctor's. He gets a bottle of pills
from his pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Must remember to give Romana hers. <br>
(He takes a pill and carries on reading.) <br>
DOCTOR: The conditions existing on the planet Magla make it incapable
of supporting any lifeform. Huh. Huh. Huh. He obviously doesn't realise
the planet Magla's an eight thousand mile wide amoeba that has grown a
crusty shell. I wonder what he does know? <br>
(The Doctor closes the book and looks to his right. There are three
androgynous figures with dark skins, white spacesuits and white plaited
hair pointing weapons at him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good evening. You'll forgive me if I don't rise. It's er. <br>
(By the time Romana returns, still unaware that she is being followed
-) <br>
ROMANA: Doctor! <br>
(Only the book remains. She starts to explore the rest of the building,
then there is an explosion and the man who was following her enters.
She backs away from him and falls down a long metal shaft. Quickly, the
man secures the rope he is carrying around a column.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Spacecraft]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Shiny and white, with comfy seats and plenty of
flashing lights on wall panels. The Doctor is brought in through an
airlock and left to look around on his own. He starts to whistle
Colonel Bogey but no one takes any notice.) <br>
DOCTOR: I must say how grateful I am to you charming people. I repeat
how grateful I am to you charming people. You lifted that column off me
as though it were a matchstick. I can't think for the life of me where
you keep your muscles. <br>
(He picks up a small piece of equipment. A crewman take it off
him.)&nbsp;<br>
SHARREL: It is an essential qualification that all crew members are in
peak condition. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Yes, part of their training, is it? Well, excuse me.
<br>
(He goes to a comfy settee and sits.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well now, I told you a little bit about myself. What about you?
What brings you to, what's this planet called, by the way? <br>
SHARREL: You don't know? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I had a little trouble with my directional equipment. <br>
SHARREL: You made a forced landing? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, something of the sort. <br>
SHARREL: Not a world one would visit from choice. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
SHARREL: The planet is listed in our star catalogue as D5 gamma zed
alpha. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's not much help. See, I'm terribly old-fashioned. I
prefer names. <br>
SHARREL: I believe the planet is called Skaro. <br>
DOCTOR: Skaro? <br>
SHARREL: You know it? <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing here? <br>
SHARREL: The nature of our mission is secret. You'll understand, I'm
sure. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don't understand. Why are you here on Skaro? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bottom of shaft]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Romana wakes under the light of a mobile spot.
She gets up, dusts herself off and goes exploring the sound of moving
rock. A metal wall nearby is shaking. Meanwhile, her follower is
starting down the shaft after her. Suddenly, the metal wall is broken
through by three large mobile pepperpots with bad attitudes. She tries
to run away but the wall below the shaft stops her.) <br>
DALEKS: Do not move! Do not move! Do not move! Do not move! Do not
move! Do not move! You are our prisoner! Do not move! You are our

DALEK 2: The prisoner is unarmed. <br>
DALEK: At my command, you will move forward. Any attempt to escape will
be punished. No further warning will be given. Is that understood? Is
that understood? Speak! Speak! <br>
ROMANA: Yes! I understand. <br>
DALEK: The prisoner will be taken to interrogation. <br>

taken away.) </font></p>

doing here on Skaro. It's vital. <br>
SHARREL: Why? What do you know of Skaro? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'll tell you when you tell me what you're doing here. <br>
SHARREL: Very well. I don't see why this should compromise us. Our
mission is directed against the force known as the Daleks. A race of
evil auto <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Thank you, I know. <br>
SHARREL: You know the Daleks? <br>

sent here to spy on the Daleks. True or false? <br>
ROMANA: False! False, false. Leave me alone. <br>
DALEK 2: Detector indicates truthful response. <br>
DALEK: Standard interrogation complete. Report analysis of responses. <br>
DALEK 2: Analysis of responses indicates that subject is category nine.
<br>
DALEK: Category nine subjects represent no threat to Dalek security.
Release the prisoner. <br>
ROMANA: Does that mean I can go? <br>
DALEK: Humanoids are useful work machines. You have no other value. You
will be assigned to labour force two. <br>
ROMANA: Labour force two? <br>
DALEK: You will obey all Dalek commands instantly. You will complete
your work schedule. If you fail, you will be exterminated. <br>

AGELLA: The patrol has found a prisoner. <br>
SHARREL: Yes? Bring him in at once. <br>

<br>
TYSSAN: (to the Doctor) Starship engineer Tyssan, serving with the Deep
Space Fleet out of the planet Earth. <br>
(The Doctor points to Sharrel - not me, him.) <br>
TYSSAN: By my timescale, I was taken captive two years ago, and since
then I've been a prisoner of the Daleks. <br>

ROMANA: How long have the Daleks been guarding you? <br>
VELDAN: A long time. I'm from the planet Sirian. The Daleks raided our
settlement one day, took more than fifty of us. <br>
(Say Hi to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0948118/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> David
Yip</a>, before he became the Chinese Detective.) <br>
JALL: (woman) I was a civilian passenger on a space shuttle. The Daleks
attacked. I was the only survivor. <br>
VELDAN: They keep their captives in a prison ship in space. Once you're
there, your life expectancy tends to be on the short side. <br>
JALL: We thought we were lucky when we were picked to come on this
mission. <br>
ROMANA: How many of you? <br>
JALL: About fifty. I thought there might be a chance to escape. <br>
ROMANA: Why didn't you? The burial party I saw wasn't guarded. <br>
VELDAN: Anyone attempting to escape and the Daleks kill five of those
remaining. Escape plans are not as popular as they were. <br>
ROMANA: And the Daleks brought you here to do this? <br>
JALL: They've got huge machines to do the drilling, but when it comes
to clearing up there's nothing as adaptable as a humanoid. <br>
VELDAN: And nothing as expendable. <br>
ROMANA: The Daleks would be far better off with machines for this job. <br>
JALL: Perhaps they just enjoy subjugating humanoid races. <br>
ROMANA: They used to be humanoid themselves. <br>
DALEK: Silence. Silence. Silence. You will remain silent at all times. <br>
(Romana sways.) <br>
VELDAN: Are you all right? <br>
ROMANA: It's the radiation. I've got to get out of here. <br>
JALL: We told you what happens if anyone tries to escape. <br>
VELDAN: You'll get out of here when you're dead. Believe me, that's the
only way. When you're dead. <br>
DALEK: Keep away. <br>
VELDAN: But she's sick. <br>
DALEK: Continue with your work. Those unfit for work will be
exterminated. <br>
VELDAN: The only way you get out of here is dead. <br>

TYSSAN: A high security ship has started out from Earth to meet us. You
will be taken to stand trial for your crimes against the whole of
sentient creation. <br>
DAVROS: There is not a ship, not a prison that can hold me! <br>
DOCTOR: No, but I think this little device can. It's a cryogenic
freezer. Even you can't escape from a solid block of ice. Bye, bye,
Davros. <br>
(The Doctor turns it on. A message comes up on the main screen about
the flight programme status.) <br>
TYSSAN: Doctor! Doctor! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Dunes]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (But the Doctor and Romana are gone, running to
the dunes as the spacecraft closes it's entrance and starts to lift
off.) <br>
DOCTOR: That was a narrow escape. Come on, we've got some digging to
do. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Romana push rocks away from the
Tardis door.) <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, could you really have solved their problems and won the
war for them? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course I could. It's obvious. <br>
ROMANA: Was it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Both sides were fighting with computers, perfectly
logically. Each computer could predict the move of the other and
counter it. Result, stalemate. <br>
ROMANA: So the first side that switches its computer off and does
something irrational <br>
DOCTOR: Wins the battle, yes. Make mistakes and confuse the enemy. <br>
ROMANA: Brilliant. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: Is that why you always win? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. What? <br>
ROMANA: Because you always make mistakes. <br>
DOCTOR: Mistakes? Me? Well, perhaps once a century or so. <br>
(They go into the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Well, I have made the odd mistake. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
ROMANA [OC]: Not that switch. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: What? <br>
(The Tardis materialises.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh, yes. <br>
(And dematerialises again.) </font> </p>
