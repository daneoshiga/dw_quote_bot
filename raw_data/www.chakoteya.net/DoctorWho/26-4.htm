car in the road whilst a black cat with piercing yellow eyes watches
from atop a brick wall. His mother calls out from the terraced house.) <br>
MOTHER: Dave, your dinner's on the table! <br>
DAVE: All right, Mum! <br>
(The black cat hisses. A wind starts to blow. Dave turns around and
looks up then begins to run down the avenue, still clutching the soapy
sponge and looking over his shoulder, until he trips over his own
feet.) <br>
MAN: No! <br>
(Flash! and the avenue is empty.) <br>
<i> (His mother comes out of the house.) <br>
MOTHER: Dave? <br>

end of the avenue and runs away just as the Tardis materialises on the
corner with Bleasdale Avenue.) <br>
ACE: You had to pick a Sunday, didn't you? You bring me back to the
boredom capitol of the universe, you pick the one day of the week you
can't even get a decent television programme. <br>
DOCTOR: As I recall, Ace, we came here at your request. <br>
ACE: I just said I wondered what the old gang was up to, that's all.
You didn't have to bring us here. You could have dropped me up in town.
I could have phoned. I just wanted to see what my old mates were up to.
You didn't have to have the guided tour. <br>
(The Doctor picks up the bucket that once contained soapy water and
raises his hat to Dave's mother.) <br>
ACE: Come on, Professor. <br>
DOCTOR: So what's so terrible about Perivale? <br>
ACE: Nothing ever happens here.

DOCTOR: You've been away as long as you think you have. <br>
ACE: I feel like I've been away forever. <br>
DOCTOR: Any particular reason for coming here? <br>
ACE: It's Sunday. Some of the gang always comes up here on a Sunday. <br>
DOCTOR: What for? <br>
ACE: Oh, I don't know. Light a fire, muck about, you know. <br>
(The Doctor yawns.) <br>
ACE: Well, I told you it was dull. You don't have to hang around here.
I'll meet you back at the Tardis if you want. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure I'll find something to interest me. <br>
ACE: Maybe they don't come up here anymore. There's no one around, is
there? Nothing but tin cans and stray cats. <br>
(The Doctor sniffs a tin can, then examines a print in a muddy area.) <br>
DOCTOR: And horses. <br>

mugger? Help him up, dust him down, shake hands? Go on! <br>

you in a minute. Okay, lads, shake hands and we'll see you next week,
okay? Bye now. <br>
PATERSON: What? <br>
STUART: I'd already beat him, Sarge! <br>
PATERSON: Oh, you think I'm too hard, do you? Pushing you too hard, am
I? Have you ever heard of survival of the fittest, son, eh? Have you
ever heard of that? Life's not a game, son. I mean, I'm teaching you
the art of survival. I'm teaching you to fight back. What happens when
life starts pushing you around, son, eh? What're you going to
do then? <br>

clenched fist at him. The Sergeant grabs his arm easily.) <br>

STUART: All right, Sarge. <br>
PATERSON: Good. Off you go, then. <br>

I'll give it a go. <br>

think I want to give up my one day of rest to come in here and stand
behind a cash register? <br>

something about that on the news the other night. <br>
LEN: Yeah. Law of the jungle, though, right? <br>
HARVEY: Yeah. Survival of the fittest, mate. <br>

will find particularly irresistible? <br>

LEN: It's really dark, and they hear this terrible noise outside the
tent. This terrible roaring noise. And one bloke turns to the other
bloke and he says, do you hear that? <br>

HARVEY: Oh, right, yeah. <br>
LEN: That was a lion. <br>

LEN: And the other bloke, he doesn't say anything. He just starts
putting on his running shoes. And the other bloke turns to him and
says, what are you doing? You can't outrun a lion. The bloke turns to
him and says, I don't have to outrun the lion. <br>
HARVEY: (feeble laugh) Don't get it. <br>
DOCTOR: He doesn't have to outrun the lion, only his friend. Then the
lion catches up with his friend and eats him. The strong survive, the
weak are killed. The law of the jungle. <br>

ANGE: UFOs. They whisk 'em off and do experiments on them like we do on
animals. I wouldn't fancy cutting Stevie up to see what's inside, would
you? Come on, give us ten pence, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Not a very efficient way to hunt, is it? All that noise and
pantomime just to slaughter one little animal. No, if you're going to
hunt, you stalk your prey. You observe it, so you can take it by
surprise, and then you don't kill too many. Cover your tracks, so you
don't leave a smell. Can you smell that? <br>

KARRA: When I'm hungry, I hunt. When I hunt, I eat. <br>
ACE: Would you eat me? <br>
KARRA: There is meat here. <br>
ACE: Yeah, but if there wasn't, would you kill me? <br>
KARRA: How fast can you run, sister? <br>
ACE: Fast enough. <br>
KARRA: Ah, that would be a good hunt. Are you hungry? Come and eat. <br>
(Ace dismounts and starts towards the corpse when the Doctor arrives.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ace! Ace, come back. Come home. Come home. <br>
(Ace runs to the Doctor, her eyes human again.) <br>
KARRA: Good hunting, sister. <br>
ACE: What's happening to me, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, Ace. We're going home.

PATERSON: What's your game, then? <br>
(Paterson lets go of Derek's hand.) <br>
PATERSON: So, I had a blackout. It's perfectly normal. Stress,
overwork, that's all. I've had medicals. You should've got a doctor to
me, though. That's the least you could've done, instead of keeping me
lying about in the street. You're a doctor, right? You should know
better. <br>

back home. <br>

have. Where does Midge live? <br>

KARRA: The chase. To hunt in the morning and live till evening. Run out
of the light, and slip into the dark. Smell the blood on the wind. Hear
your blood in your ears. Die at last, with your enemy's blood in your
mouth. With your enemy's blood in your mouth! <br>

circles Midge's body then stops in front of the Master.) <br>

I command you. You've no power over me. I can do anything I wish with
