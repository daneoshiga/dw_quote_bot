DOCTOR: Did they see you? <br>
MARTHA: I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: But did they see you? <br>
MARTHA: I don't know. I was too busy running. <br>
DOCTOR: Martha, it's important. Did they see your face? <br>
MARTHA: No, they couldn't have. <br>
DOCTOR: Off we go! <br>
(He sets the Tardis in motion.) <br>
DOCTOR: Argh! They're following us. <br>
MARTHA: How can they do that? You've got a time machine. <br>
DOCTOR: Stolen technology. They've got a Time Agent's vortex
manipulator. They can follow us wherever we go, right across the
universe. They're never going to stop, unless. I'll have to do it.
Martha, you trust me, don't you? <br>
MARTHA: Of course I do. <br>
DOCTOR: Because it all depends on you. <br>
MARTHA: What does? What am I supposed to do? <br>
(He holds out an ornately decorated pocket watch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Take this watch, because my life depends on it. This watch,
Martha. The watch is </font></p>

wood panelled room. A clock is ticking. There are voices in the
corridor outside. He gets up, and there is a knock on the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come in. <br>
(Martha enters, carrying a breakfast tray and wearing maid's uniform
complete with little cap. She turns her back when she sees he isn't
fully dressed.) <br>
MARTHA: Pardon me, Mister Smith. You're not dressed yet. I can come
back later. <br>
(He puts on a dressing gown.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's all right, it's all right. Put it down. I was er.
Sorry, sorry. Sometimes I have these extraordinary dreams. <br>
(Martha puts the tray down on a table by the leather settee and draws
the curtains.) <br>
MARTHA: What about, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: I dream I'm this adventurer. This daredevil, a madman. The
Doctor, I'm called. And last night I dreamt that you were there, as my
companion. <br>
MARTHA: A teacher and a housemaid, sir? That's impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm a man from another world, though. <br>
MARTHA: Well it can't be true because there's no such thing. <br>
DOCTOR: This thing. The watch is <br>
(He picks up the ornate pocket watch from the mantlepiece for a moment
then puts it back.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, it's funny how dreams slip away. But I do remember one
thing; it all took place in the future. In the Year of Our Lord two
thousand and seven. <br>
MARTHA: I can prove that wrong for you, sir. Here's the morning paper.
It's Monday, November tenth, nineteen thirteen, and you're completely
human, sir. As human as they come. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm, that's me. Completely human.

assembly, and the Union Flag is raised on the flagpole outside the
magnificent Gothic Revival building. Wearing gown and mortar board, the

text book on the Battle of Waterloo, 18th June 1815.) <br>
DOCTOR: Advanced with little impediment. The French were all but spent,
with only two battalions of the old guard remaining. A final reserve
force was charged with protecting Napoleon, but by evening, the advance
of the Allied troops had forced them to retreat.

the two housemaids, Martha and Jenny are scrubbing on their hands and

MARTHA: Morning, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, hi. <br>
(The Doctor goes up the stairs.) <br>
JENNY: Head in the clouds, that one. Don't know why you're so sweet on
him. <br>
MARTHA: He's just kind to me, that's all. Not everyone's that
considerate, what with me being <br>
JENNY: A Londoner? <br>
MARTHA: Exactly. Good old London town. <br>
(Two senior boys stop.) <br>
BAINES: Er, now then, you two. You're not paid to have fun, are you?
Put a little backbone into it. <br>
JENNY: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. <br>
HUTCHINSON: You there, what's your name again? <br>
MARTHA: Martha, sir. Martha Jones. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Tell me then, Jones. With hands like those, how can you
tell when something's clean? <br>
(They walk on, laughing.) <br>
MARTHA: That's very funny, sir. <br>
JENNY: Careful, now. Don't answer back. <br>
MARTHA: I'd answer back with my bucket over his head. <br>
JENNY: Oh, I wish. Just think, though. In a few years time, boys like
that'll be running the country. <br>

carrying a large pile of books.) <br>
JOAN: Oh, good morning, Mister Smith. <br>

DOCTOR: There we go. <br>
JOAN: Let me help you. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I've got it, no. Er, how best to retrieve? Tell you
what. If you could take these <br>
(Joan takes the books from his arms, and he picks up the fallen ones.) <br>
JOAN: Good. <br>
DOCTOR: No harm done. So, er, how was Jenkins? <br>
JOAN: Oh just a cold. Nothing serious. I think he's missing his mother
more than anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we can't have that. <br>
JOAN: He received a letter this morning, so he's a lot more chipper. I
appear to be holding your books. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so you are. Sorry, sorry. Just let me. <br>
JOAN: No, why don't I take half? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, brilliant idea. Brilliant. Perfect. Division of labour. <br>
JOAN: We make quite a team. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't we just. <br>
JOAN: So, these books. Were they being taken in any particular
direction? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. This way. <br>
(In a smaller corridor.) <br>
DOCTOR: I always say, Matron, give the boys a good head of steam,
they'll soon wear themselves out. <br>
JOAN: Truth be told, when it's just you and me, I'd much rather you
call me Nurse Redfern. Matron sounds rather well, matronly. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Nurse Redfern it is then. <br>
JOAN: Though we've known each other all of two months, you could even
say Joan. <br>
DOCTOR: Joan? <br>
JOAN: That's my name. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, obviously. <br>
JOAN: And it's John, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it is, yes. <br>
(At the notice board at the top of a flight of stairs.) <br>
JOAN: Have you seen this, John? The annual dance at the village hall
tomorrow. It's nothing formal, but rather fun by all accounts. Do you
think you'll go? <br>
DOCTOR: I hadn't thought about it. <br>
JOAN: It's been ages since I've been to a dance, only no one's asked
me. <br>
(The Doctor starts backing away nervously.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I should imagine that you'd be, er, I mean, I never
thought you'd be one for. I mean, there's no reason why you shouldn't.
If you do, you may not. I, I probably won't, but even if I did then I
couldn't. I mean I wouldn't want to <br>

DOCTOR: What about the stairs? <br>
JOAN: They're right behind you. <br>

JOAN: Stop it. I get boys causing less fuss than this. <br>
DOCTOR: Because it hurts. <br>
(Martha bursts in.) <br>
MARTHA: Is he all right? <br>
JOAN: Excuse me, Martha. It's hardly good form to enter a master's
study without knocking. <br>
MARTHA: Sorry. Right. Yeah. <br>
(She goes back to the door and knocks on it.) <br>
MARTHA: But is he all right? They said you fell down the stairs, Sir. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it was just a tumble, that's all. <br>
MARTHA: Have you checked for concussion? <br>
JOAN: I have. And I daresay I know a lot more about it than you. <br>
MARTHA: Sorry. I'll just tidy your things. <br>
DOCTOR: I was just telling Nurse Redfern, Matron, about my dreams. They
are quite remarkable tales. I keep imagining that I'm someone else, and
that I'm hiding. <br>
JOAN: Hiding? In what way? <br>
DOCTOR: They're almost every night. This is going to sound silly. <br>
JOAN: Tell me. <br>
DOCTOR: I dream, quite often, that I have two hearts. <br>
JOAN: Well, then. I can be the judge of that. Let's find out.<br>
(Joan uses her stethoscope to listen to the Doctor's chest.) <br>
JOAN: I can confirm the diagnosis. Just one heart, singular. <br>
DOCTOR: I have er, I have written down some of these dreams in the form
of fiction. Not that it would be of any interest. <br>
JOAN: I'd be very interested. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've never actually shown it to anyone before. <br>
(The Doctor gives Joan the handwritten book.) <br>
JOAN: A Journal of Impossible Things. <br>
(Lots of inky scrawl and pictures.) <br>
JOAN: Just look at these creatures. <br>
(A Dalek.) <br>
JOAN: Such imagination. <br>
DOCTOR: It's become quite a hobby. <br>
(The Moxx of Balhoon, Autons labelled as plastic men, one of the
Pompadour clockwork robots.) <br>
JOAN: It's wonderful. And quite an eye for the pretty girls. <br>
(Rose Tyler.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, she's just an invention. This character, Rose. I
call her, Rose. Seems to disappear later on. <br>
(Cybermen and the Tardis, labelled magic box.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the box. The blue box. It's always there. Like a
like a magic carpet. This funny little box that transports me to far
away places. <br>
JOAN: Like a doorway? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>
(Sketches of earlier Doctors.) <br>
DOCTOR: I sometimes think how magical life would be if stories like
this were true. <br>
JOAN: If only. <br>
DOCTOR: It's just a dream. <br>

MARTHA: Ma'am? That book. <br>
JOAN: Oh, I'll look after it. Don't worry. He did say I could read it. <br>
MARTHA: But it's silly, that's all. Just stories. <br>
JOAN: Who is he, Martha? <br>
MARTHA: I'm sorry? <br>
JOAN: It's like he's left the kettle on. Like he knows he has something
to get back to, but he can't remember what. <br>
MARTHA: That's just him. <br>
JOAN: You arrived with him, didn't you? He found you employment here at
the school, isn't that right? <br>
MARTHA: I used to work for the family. He just sort of inherited me. <br>
JOAN: Well, I'd be careful. If you don't mind my saying, you sometimes
seem a little familiar with him. Best remember your position. <br>

say that Latimer would appear to be Hutchinson's fag?) <br>
HUTCHINSON: Blasted Catullus. I want it done by morning. <br>
LATIMER: Yes, sir. <br>
HUTCHINSON: And no mistakes. I want it written by best handwriting. <br>
(Hutchinson reads a letter.) <br>
HUTCHINSON: Listen, Father says he's been promoted. That means more
money. Might end up in a better school. <br>
LATIMER: Ah, he should enjoy it, sir. My uncle had a six month posting
in Johannesburg. Says it was the most beautiful countryside on God's
Earth. <br>
HUTCHINSON: What are you talking about? <br>
LATIMER: Africa. Your father. <br>
HUTCHINSON: You been reading my post? <br>
LATIMER: What? <br>
HUTCHINSON: You said Africa. I've only just read the word myself. How
did you know that? <br>
(He pushes Latimer up against the wall.) <br>
LATIMER: I haven't. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Have you been spying on me? <br>
LATIMER: No. I just guessed. <br>
HUTCHINSON: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
LATIMER: I'm good at guessing, that's all. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Idiot. <br>
LATIMER: Sometimes I say things and they turn out to be correct. Just
little things. Tiny things. I can't help it. It's just some sort of
luck. <br>
BAINES: Right, well, never mind that little toad. Who's for beer? <br>
HUTCHINSON: You've got beer? <br>
BAINES: No, but Baxter's hidden a secret supply in Blackdown woods. <br>
HUTCHINSON: What are you waiting for? <br>

HUTCHINSON: Make sure the Bursar's down the pub before you go past his
window. <br>

MARTHA: Ooo, it's freezing out here. Why can't we have a drink inside
the pub? <br>
JENNY: Now don't be ridiculous. You do get these notions! It's all very
well, those Suffragettes. but that's London. That's miles away. <br>
MARTHA: But don't you just want to scream sometimes, having to bow and
scrape and behave. Don't you just
want to tell them? <br>
JENNY: I don't know. Things must be different in your country. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah, well they are. Thank God I'm not staying. <br>
JENNY: You keep saying that. <br>
MARTHA: Just you wait. One more month and I'm as free as the wind. I
wish you could come with me, Jenny. You'd love it. <br>
JENNY: Where are you going to go? <br>
MARTHA: Anywhere. Just look up there. Imagine you could go all the way
out to the stars. <br>
JENNY: You don't half say mad things. <br>
MARTHA: That's where I'm going. Into the sky, all the way out. <br>

MARTHA: Did you see it, though? Right up there, just for a second. <br>

that appears to be searching the ground. Then it disappears. She runs.)

MARTHA: Matron, are you all right? <br>
JOAN: Did you see that? There was something in the woods. This light. <br>

DOCTOR: Anything wrong, ladies? Far too cold to be standing around in
the dark, don't you. <br>
JOAN: There, there. Look in the sky. <br>
(A light crosses the sky.) <br>
JENNY: Oh, that's beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR: All gone. Commonly known as a meteorite. It's just rocks
falling to the ground, that's all. <br>
JOAN: It came down in the woods. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. No, they always look close, when actually they're
miles off. Nothing left but a cinder. Now, I should escort you back to
the school. Ladies? <br>
MARTHA: No, we're fine, thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: Then I shall bid you goodnight. <br>

headed. <br>

DOCTOR: Chameleon Arch. Rewrites my biology. Literally changes every
single cell in my body. I've set it to human. <br>

DOCTOR: Now, the Tardis will take care of everything. Invent a life
story for me, find me a setting and integrate me. Can't do the same for
you. You'll just have to improvise. I should have just enough residual
awareness to let you in. <br>

list of instructions for when I'm human. One, don't let me hurt anyone.
We can't have that, but you know what humans are like. Two, don't worry
about the Tardis. I'll put it on emergency power so they can't detect
it. Just let it hide away. Four. No, wait a minute, three. No getting
involved in big historical events. Four, you. Don't let me abandon you.

do then? <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: And twenty three. If anything goes wrong, if they
find us, Martha, then you know what to do. Open the watch. Everything I
am is kept safe in there. Now, I've put a perception filter on it so
the human me won't think anything of it. To him, it's just a watch. But
don't open it unless you have to. Because once it's open, then the

Where did I put it? And I wanted a little word. Your marks aren't quite
good enough. <br>
LATIMER: I'm top ten in my class, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, be honest, Timothy, you should be the very top. You're a
clever boy. You seem to be hiding it. Where is that book? And I know
why. Keeping your head low avoids the mockery of your classmates. But
no man should hide himself, don't you think? <br>

another war those boys won't find it so amusing. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Great Britain is at peace, long may it reign. <br>
JOAN: In your journal, in one of your stories, you wrote about next

falling across the entire world. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, we can be thankful it's not true. And I'll admit
mankind doesn't need warfare and bloodshed to prove itself. Everyday
life can provide honour and valour, and let's hope that from now on
this, this country can find its heroes in smaller places. <br>

outside the Ironmongers, which falls and hits a plank that sends a
