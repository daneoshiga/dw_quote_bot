brake.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we go. Perfect landing. Which isn't easy in such a tight
spot. <br>
MARTHA: You should be used to tight spots by now. Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: The end of the line. No place like it. <br>
(Martha goes outside.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis is next to the clothes horse.) <br>
MARTHA: Home. You took me home? <br>
DOCTOR: In fact, the morning after we left, so you've only been gone
about twelve hours. No time at all, really.&nbsp;<br>
MARTHA: But all the stuff we've done. Shakespeare, New New York, old
New York? <br>
DOCTOR: Yep, all in one night, relatively speaking. Everything should
be just as it was. Books, CDs, laundry. So, back were you were, as
promised. <br>
MARTHA: This is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I should probably er <br>
(Martha's phone rings and the answering machine starts up.) <br>
MARTHA [on machine]: Hi, I'm out. Leave a message. <br>
MARTHA: I'm sorry. <br>
FRANCINE [on machine]: Martha, are you there? Pick it up, will you? <br>
MARTHA: It's Mum. It'll wait. <br>
FRANCINE: All right then, pretend that you're out if you like. I was
only calling to say that your sister's on TV. On the news of all
things. Just thought you might be interested. <br>
(Martha turns on the television, which was on stand by.) <br>
LAZARUS [on television]: The details are top secret <br>
MARTHA: How could Tish end up on the news? <br>
(Tish is standing next to an elderly man who is making an
announcement.) <br>
LAZARUS [on television]: Tonight, I will demonstrate a device which
will redefine our world. <br>
MARTHA: She's got a new job. PR for some research lab. <br>
LAZARUS [on television]: With the push of a single button, I will
change what it means to be human. <br>
REPORTER [on television]: Professor! Professor! <br>
(Martha puts the TV back on standby.) <br>
MARTHA: Sorry. You were saying we should? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, we should. One trip is what we said. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah. I suppose things just kind of escalated. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. Seems to happen to me a lot. <br>
MARTHA: Thank you. For everything. <br>
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure. <br>
(The Doctor goes back into the Tardis, and it dematerialises. Then it
materialises again.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm sorry. Did he say he was going to change what it means
to be human?

and a model of a cathedral is on a stand. An older woman is speaking to
the elderly man.) <br>
LADY THAW: Are you sure it's safe? <br>
LAZARUS: There were some issues. They've been resolved. I'm confident
I'm in no serious danger. <br>
LADY THAW: That's comforting, Richard, but it wasn't just you I was
worried about. <br>
LAZARUS: Your concern is touching. <br>
LADY THAW: The people in that room will represent billions of pounds
worth of potential investment. Mister Saxon wants to be sure they like
what they see. <br>
LAZARUS: Don't worry. Our friend will get his money's worth. <br>
(Tish enters.) <br>
TISH: You wanted to see the guest list for tonight, Professor? <br>
LAZARUS: Yes. Thank you, Leticia. <br>
(She puts the file on his desk, and he puts his hand on hers.) <br>
LAZARUS: That's an interesting perfume. What's it called? <br>
TISH: Soap. <br>
(Tish pulls her hand away and leaves.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor and Martha are in formal evening
dress.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, black tie. Whenever I wear this, something bad always
happens. <br>
MARTHA: It's not the outfit, that's just you. Anyway, I think it suits
you. In a James Bond kind of way. <br>
DOCTOR: James Bond? Really? <br>
(They walk up to a building labelled Lazarus Laboratories.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Reception room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In the middle of the room is a circular dais. On
it is a man-sized frosted
glass chamber and four upright posts, slightly curved at the top to aim
at the
chamber. A waiter walks past with a tray of food.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, look, they've got nibbles! I love nibbles. <br>
TISH: Hello. <br>
MARTHA: Tish. <br>
TISH: You look great. So, what do you think? Impressive, isn't it? <br>
MARTHA: Very. <br>
TISH: And two nights out in a row for you. That's dangerously close to
a social life. <br>
MARTHA: If I keep this up, I'll end up in all the gossip columns. <br>
TISH: You might, actually. You should keep an eye out for
photographers. And Mum, she's coming too. Even dragging Leo along with
her. <br>
MARTHA: Leo in black tie? That I must see. This is, er, the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
TISH: Is he with you? <br>
MARTHA: Yeah. <br>
TISH: But he's not on the list. How did he get in? <br>
MARTHA: He's my plus one. <br>
DOCTOR: So, this Lazarus, he's your boss? <br>
TISH: Professor Lazarus, yes. I'm part of his executive staff. <br>
MARTHA: She's in the PR department. <br>
TISH: I'm head of the PR department, actually. <br>
MARTHA: You're joking. <br>
TISH: I put this whole thing together. <br>
DOCTOR: So do you know what the professor's going to be doing tonight?
That looks like it might be a sonic microfield manipulator. <br>
TISH: He's a science geek. I should have known. Got to get back to work
now. I'll catch up with you later. <br>
DOCTOR: Science geek? What does that mean? <br>
MARTHA: That your obsessively enthusiastic about it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, nice. <br>
(Francine enters with Leo.) <br>
FRANCINE: Your father's caused me enough heartache already with his
menopause and his trophy girlfriend. <br>
LEO: Yeah, Mum, I know. It's just something he said last night. <br>
FRANCINE: Martha. <br>
MARTHA: Mum! <br>
(Martha gives her mother a big hug.) <br>
FRANCINE: All right, what's the occasion? <br>
MARTHA: What do you mean? I'm just pleased to see you, that's all. <br>
FRANCINE: You saw me last night. <br>
MARTHA: I know. I just miss you. You're looking good, Leo. <br>
LEO: Yeah. If anyone asks me to fetch them a drink, I'll swing for him.
<br>
FRANCINE: You disappeared last night. <br>
MARTHA: I just went home. <br>
FRANCINE: On your own? <br>
MARTHA: This is a friend of mine. The Doctor. <br>
FRANCINE: Doctor what? <br>
MARTHA: No, it's just the Doctor. We've been doing some work together. <br>
LEO: You all right, mate? <br>
DOCTOR: It's lovely to meet you, Mrs Jones. Heard a lot about you. <br>
FRANCINE: Have you? What have you heard, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you know, that you're Martha's mother and. Er, no,
actually, that's about it. We haven't had much time to chat. You know,
been busy. <br>
FRANCINE: Busy? Doing what, exactly? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh you know. Stuff. <br>
(Professor Lazarus taps on his glass for attention.) <br>
LAZARUS: Ladies and gentlemen, I am Professor Richard Lazarus and
tonight I am going to perform a miracle. It is, I believe, the most
important advance since Rutherford split the atom, the biggest leap
since Armstrong stood on the moon. Tonight, you will watch and wonder.
Tomorrow, you will wake to a world which will be changed forever. <br>
(Lazarus goes inside the chamber. A pair of lady scientists start up
the machine and press a big red button. The four columns start to
oscillate and rotate around the chamber as they pour energy into it.
Then an alarm sounds.) <br>
DOCTOR: Something's wrong. It's overloading. <br>
(The computer agrees. There are sparks from the controls, then smoke.
The Doctor rushes over and gets out his sonic screwdriver.) <br>
LADY THAW: Somebody stop him. Get him away from those controls! <br>
DOCTOR: If this thing goes up, it'll take the whole building with it.
Is that what you want? <br>
(Finally, the Doctor pulls out a big power cable and the contraption
slows down, then stops. Martha rushes to the
chamber.) <br>
DOCTOR: Get it open! <br>
(Martha opens the door, and a young man staggers out. Lady Thaw is
delighted.) <br>
LAZARUS: Ladies and gentlemen, I am Richard Lazarus. I am seventy six
years old and I am reborn! <br>
(Wild applause.) <br>
LADY THAW: He did it. He actually did it. <br>
(A little later, Lazarus is posing for the photographers.) <br>
MARTHA: It can't be the same guy. It's impossible. It must be a trick. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's not a trick. I wish it were. <br>
MARTHA: What just happened then? <br>
DOCTOR: He just changed what it means to be human. <br>
LADY THAW: Excuse me. That was the most astonishing thing I've ever
seen. Look at you. <br>
LAZARUS: This is only the beginning. We're not just making history,
we're shaping the future, too. <br>
LADY THAW: Think of the money we'll make. People will sell their souls
to be transformed like that. And I'll be first in line. <br>
(Lazarus stiffens and gasps, then grabs a tray from a passing waiter
and proceeds to eat all the food on it.) <br>
LADY THAW: Richard. <br>
LAZARUS: I'm famished. <br>
DOCTOR: Energy deficit. Always happens with this kind of process. <br>
LAZARUS: You speak as if you see this every day, Mister? <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor. And well, no, not every day, but I have some experience
of this kind of transformation. <br>
LAZARUS: That's not possible. <br>
DOCTOR: Using hypersonic sound waves to create a state of resonance.
That's inspired. <br>
LAZARUS: You understand the theory, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Enough to know that you couldn't possibly have allowed for all
the variables. <br>
LAZARUS: No experiment is entirely without risk. <br>
DOCTOR: That thing nearly exploded. You might as well have stepped into
a blender. <br>
LADY THAW: You're not qualified to comment. <br>
DOCTOR: If I hadn't stopped it, it would have exploded. <br>
LAZARUS: Then I thank you, Doctor. But that's a simple engineering
issue. What happened inside the capsule was exactly what was supposed
to happen. No more, no less. <br>
MARTHA: You've no way of knowing that until you've run proper tests. <br>
LAZARUS: Look at me. You can see what happened. I'm all the proof you
need. <br>
LADY THAW: This device will be properly certified before we start to
operate commercially. <br>
MARTHA: Commercially? You are joking. That'll cause chaos. <br>
LAZARUS: Not chaos, change. A chance for humanity to evolve, to
improve. <br>
DOCTOR: This isn't about improving. This is about you and your
customers living a little longer. <br>
LAZARUS: Not a little longer, Doctor. A lot longer. Perhaps
indefinitely. <br>
LADY THAW: Richard, we have things to discuss, upstairs. <br>
LAZARUS: Goodbye, Doctor. In a few years, you'll look back and laugh at
how wrong you were. <br>
(Lazarus kisses Martha's hand, and leaves with Lady Thaw.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, he's out of his depth. No idea of the damage he might have
done. <br>
MARTHA: So what do we do now? <br>
DOCTOR: Now? Well, this building must be full of laboratories. I say we
do our own tests. <br>
MARTHA: Lucky I've just collected a DNA sample then, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Martha Jones, you're a star.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAZARUS: I grew up over there. A tiny flat above a
butcher's shop. <br>
LADY THAW: It'll have a blue plaque soon. Richard Lazarus lived here. <br>
LAZARUS: It's gone. Destroyed in the war. The bombing. <br>
LADY THAW: Of course. <br>
LAZARUS: 1940. Do you remember? Night after night. Explosions, guns,
firestorm. <br>
LADY THAW: My parents had sent me to the country by then. <br>
LAZARUS: When the sirens went, we'd go to the cathedral there. We used
to shelter in the crypt. The living cowering among the dead. <br>
LADY THAW: But look at what you've built here, now. You've laid the
foundations for an empire. An empire we can rule together.
(She pulls him in for a kiss, and he pulls back in disgust.) <br>
LADY THAW: Well, what's wrong? <br>
LAZARUS: Look at yourself, woman.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(An image of a strand of DNA is on the computer
screen.) <br>
DOCTOR: Amazing. <br>
MARTHA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Lazarus's DNA. <br>
MARTHA: I can't see anything different. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at it. <br>
MARTHA: Oh, my God. Did that just change? But it can't have. <br>
DOCTOR: But it did. <br>
MARTHA: It's impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: And that's two impossible things we've seen so far tonight.
Don't you love it when that happens? <br>
MARTHA: That means Lazarus has changed his own molecular patterns. <br>
DOCTOR: Hypersonic sound waves to destabilise the cell structure, then
a metagenic programme to manipulate the coding in the protein strands.
Basically, he hacked into his own genes and instructed them to
rejuvenate. <br>
MARTHA: But they're still mutating now. <br>
DOCTOR: Because he missed something. Something in his DNA has been
activated and won't let him stabilise. Something that's trying to
change him. <br>
MARTHA: Change him into what? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I think we need to find out. <br>
MARTHA: That woman said they were going upstairs. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lazarus' office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LADY THAW: It's me who made this all possible. This
is my triumph, and I will not be denied, not by you, not after
everything I've done. <br>
LAZARUS: You backed me because you saw a profit. Your concern was
financial. <br>
LADY THAW: Well, you want the money as much as I do. We had a plan. <br>
(Lazarus looks ill.) <br>
LADY THAW: When the device is ready, I'll be rejuvenated, too. We could
be rich and young and together. <br>
LAZARUS: You think I'd waste another lifetime on you? <br>
LADY THAW: Did that process make you even more cruel? <br>
LAZARUS: No, my love. That I learnt from you. You have a gift for it. <br>
LADY THAW: Then you know that I'll protect my involvement in the
project. I'm sure Mister Saxon will be interested <br>
(Lazarus gasps and pulls at his collar.) <br>
LADY THAW: What's going on? <br>
LAZARUS: It must just be, ah! <br>
LADY THAW: What is it? <br>
LAZARUS: I'll be fine in a moment. It's probably just cramp. <br>
(His back suddenly arches with a nasty cracking sound. He falls to the
floor, tugging at his bow tie and writhing.) <br>
LADY THAW: Oh! Richard! Is it some sort of seizure? What should I do? I
don't understand what's happening. Richard. <br>
(Something very inhuman rears over the terrified woman, opens what one
can only call a mouth, and lunges at her.)

FRANCINE: Tish! Have you seen Martha and that Doctor anywhere? <br>
TISH: Not since the demonstration. <br>
FRANCINE: Do you know anything about him? Has she ever mentioned him
before? <br>
TISH: Not to me. <br>
FRANCINE: The way she followed him. <br>
TISH: She's a doctor. She was just doing her job. <br>
FRANCINE: She's not a doctor yet. Never will be, if she doesn't stay
focused. <br>
LEO: Look, she's found a bloke. So what? <br>
FRANCINE: There's something going on, Leo, I can feel it. <br>
(The lift doors open and human Lazarus steps out. He has changed his
shirt, and he stretches his neck in a very inhuman way.) <br>
LAZARUS: Leticia Jones. I'd recognize the smell of that soap anywhere. <br>
TISH: Professor. <br>
LAZARUS: I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, you'll have to excuse me
while I take care of Leticia here. I've been neglecting her.

DOCTOR: So where is he? <br>
MARTHA: Don't know. Let's try back at the reception. <br>
(Martha sees a skeletal leg with a ladies shoe on it sticking out
behind the desk. ) <br>
MARTHA: Is that Lady Thaw? <br>
DOCTOR: Used to be. Now it's just a shell. Had all the life energy
drained out, like squeezing the juice out of an orange. <br>
MARTHA: Lazarus? <br>
DOCTOR: Could be. <br>
MARTHA: So he's changed already? <br>
DOCTOR: Not necessarily. You saw the DNA. It was fluctuating. The
process must demand energy. This might not have been enough. <br>
MARTHA: So he might do this again? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm.

before another arrives.) <br>
LAZARUS: You seem very young to have such a responsible position. Have
you much experience? <br>
TISH: Not really. But the interview panel thought I had all the
necessary attributes. <br>
LAZARUS: How perceptive of them. <br>
TISH: So where are you taking me? <br>
LAZARUS: Up to the roof. It's a lovely evening. I thought I'd show you
the view. It's extraordinary. <br>

LEO: Yeah, well, he was getting cosy with Tish a couple of minutes ago.

MAN: I think you need one of these. <br>
(Another glass of champagne. ) <br>
FRANCINE: Thank you. That's very kind of you. <br>
MAN: Do you know that man? <br>

with the tower of the
Collegiate Church of St Saviour and St Mary Overie in the foreground.) <br>
TISH: That clock tower's beautiful all lit up like that. <br>
LAZARUS: It's Southwark Cathedral. One of the oldest churches in
London. Been around even longer than I have. <br>
TISH: Well, you're looking pretty good for your age. <br>
LAZARUS: Thank you. <br>
TISH: Can I? <br>
LAZARUS: Of course. <br>
(She strokes his cheek.) <br>
TISH: Still can't take it in. <br>
LAZARUS: I'm still adjusting myself. I've been working toward it for so
many years, it's hard to believe the moment's finally arrived. <br>
TISH: And is it like you expected? <br>
LAZARUS: I find that nothing's ever exactly like you expect. There's
always something to surprise you. Between the idea and the reality,
between the motion and the act <br>
DOCTOR: Falls the Shadow. <br>
(The Hollow Men, by TS Eliot.) <br>
LAZARUS: So the mysterious Doctor knows his Eliot. I'm impressed. <br>
TISH: Martha, what are you doing here? <br>
MARTHA: Tish, get away from him. <br>
TISH: What? Don't tell me what to do. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't have thought you had time for poetry, Lazarus, what
with you being busy defying the laws of nature and all. <br>
LAZARUS: You're right, Doctor. One lifetime's been too short for me to
do everything I'd like. How much more I'll get done in two or three or
four. <br>
DOCTOR: Doesn't work like that. Some people live more in twenty years
than others do in eighty. It's not the time that matters, it's the
person. <br>
LAZARUS: But if it's the right person, what a gift that would be. <br>
DOCTOR: Or what a curse. Look at what you've done to yourself. <br>
LAZARUS: Who are you to judge me? <br>
MARTHA: Over here, Tish. <br>
TISH: You have to spoil everything, don't you? Every time I find
someone nice, you have to go and find fault. <br>
(Behind Tish's back, Lazarus spasms and falls.) <br>
MARTHA: Tish, he's a monster! <br>
TISH: I know the age thing's a bit freaky, but it works for Catherine
Zeta-Jones. <br>
(Then Tish turns and sees the transformation in progress. Lazarus is
now a massive bony scorpion with a human face.) <br>
TISH: What's that? <br>

TANNOY: Security one. Security one. Security one. <br>
(The lights go out and the doors all close.) <br>
MARTHA: What's happening? <br>
TISH: An intrusion. It triggers a security lockdown. Kills most of the

Then it brings its tail over, and the other mouth appears.) <br>

DOCTOR: What's the point? You can't control it. The mutation's too
strong. Killing those people won't help you. You're a fool. A vain old
man who thought he could defy nature. Only Nature got her own back,
didn't she? You're a joke, Lazarus! A footnote in the history of
failure! <br>
(The Doctor leads the mutant off down a corridor.) <br>
TISH: What's the Doctor doing? <br>
MARTHA: He's trying to buy us some time. Let's not waste it. Leo, look
at me. Focus on me. Let's see your eyes. He's got concussion. Mum,
you'll need to help him downstairs. <br>
(Martha puts some ice into a napkin.) <br>
MARTHA: This'll keep the swelling down. Go! I'll be right behind you.
Tish, move! We need to get out of here.

LAZARUS: It's no good, Doctor. You can't stop me. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that the same arrogance you had when you swore nothing had
gone wrong with your device? <br>
LAZARUS: The arrogance is yours. You can't stand in the way of
progress. <br>
DOCTOR: You call feeding on innocent people progress? You're
delusional! <br>
LAZARUS: It is a necessary sacrifice. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not your decision to make.

MARTHA: There must be an override switch. Where's the security desk?
Tish! <br>
TISH: There. <br>
(Martha jumps over the desk, goes to the control panel and runs the
sonic screwdriver over it. The lights come on, the doors open, and the
panicked crowd stream out.)

MARTHA: I don't care. I have to go. <br>
FRANCINE: It's that Doctor, isn't it? That's what's happened to you.
That's why you've changed. <br>
TISH: He was buying us time, Martha. Time for you to get out, too. <br>
MARTHA: I'm not leaving him. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor jumps on a bench and starts to take a
light fitting apart. Then he turns on a Bunsen burner and snuffs out
the flame. He pulls another tube off a gas fitting and hides behind
another bench.) <br>
LAZARUS: More hide and seek, Doctor? How disappointing. Why don't you
come out and face me? <br>
(The Doctor turns on as much gas as he can.) <br>
DOCTOR: Have you looked in the mirror lately? Why would I want to face
that, hmm? <br>
(The Doctor runs to the back door and hits the light switch as he
leaves. KaBOOM goes the laboratory.)

MARTHA: I heard the explosion. I guessed it was you. <br>

MARTHA: Did you kill him? <br>
(No.) <br>

betting he won't destroy it, not even to get at us. <br>
MARTHA: But we're trapped. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, yeah, that's a slight problem. <br>
MARTHA: You mean you don't have a plan? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the plan was to get inside here. <br>
MARTHA: Then what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, then I'd come up with another plan. <br>
MARTHA: In your own time, then. <br>
(It is a tight squeeze for two inside.) <br>
MARTHA: Hey! <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, sorry, sorry. <br>
(He gets the sonic screwdriver out of his inside pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here we are. <br>
MARTHA: What're you going to do with that? <br>
DOCTOR: Improvise. <br>
(He slides down to the floor and opens a panel, then starts working
with the wires and processors he finds there.) <br>
MARTHA: I still don't understand where that thing came from. Is it
alien? <br>
DOCTOR: No, for once it's strictly human in origin. <br>
MARTHA: Human? How can it be human? <br>
DOCTOR: Probably from dormant genes in Lazarus's DNA. The energy field
in this thing must have reactivated them. And it looks like they're
becoming dominant. <br>
MARTHA: So it's a throwback. <br>
DOCTOR: Some option that evolution rejected for you millions of years
ago, but the potential is still there. Locked away in your genes,
forgotten about until Lazarus unlocked it by mistake. <br>
MARTHA: It's like Pandora's box. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Nice shoes, by the way. <br>
(Outside, the mutant presses the big red button.) <br>
MARTHA: Doctor, what's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: Sounds like he's switched the machine on. <br>
MARTHA: And that's not good, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I was hoping it was going to take him a little bit longer
to work that out. <br>
MARTHA: I don't want to hurry you, but <br>
DOCTOR: I know, I know. Nearly done. <br>
MARTHA: Well, what're you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm trying to set the capsule to reflect energy rather than
receive it. <br>
MARTHA: Will that kill it? <br>
DOCTOR: When he transforms, he's three times his size. Cellular
triplication. So he's spreading himself thin. <br>
MARTHA: We're going to end up like him! <br>
DOCTOR: Just one more! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Reception room]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There is a big blast of energy that throws the
mutant backwards. The machine stops and the Doctor and Martha come
out.) <br>
MARTHA: I thought we were going to go through the blender then. <br>
DOCTOR: Really shouldn't take that long just to reverse the polarity. I
must be a bit out of practice. <br>
(A naked human man is lying face down on the floor.) <br>
MARTHA: Oh, God. He seems so human again. It's kind of pitiful. <br>
DOCTOR: Eliot saw that, too. This is the way the world ends. Not with a
bang, but with a whimper.

FRANCINE: Keep away from my daughter. <br>
MARTHA: Mum, what are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: All of the mothers, every time. <br>
FRANCINE: He is dangerous. I've been told things. <br>
MARTHA: What are you talking about? <br>
FRANCINE: Look around you. Nothing but death and destruction. <br>
(The ambulance leaves.) <br>
MARTHA: This isn't his fault. He saved us, all of us! <br>
LEO: And it was Tish who invited everyone to this thing in the first
place. I'd say technically, it's her fault. <br>
(Tish elbows Leo. There's a big crash, and the Doctor runs off to
investigate.) <br>
FRANCINE: Leave him. <br>

DOCTOR: That way. The church. <br>
TISH: Cathedral. It's Southwark Cathedral. He told me.

DOCTOR: Where would you go if you were looking for sanctuary? <br>
(They walk carefully up the nave to the altar. Lazarus is shivering
behind it, wrapped in the red blanket.) <br>
LAZARUS: I came here before, a lifetime ago. I thought I was going to
die then. In fact, I was sure of it. I sat here, just a child, the
sound of planes and bombs outside. <br>
DOCTOR: The Blitz. <br>
LAZARUS: You've read about it. <br>
DOCTOR: I was there. <br>
LAZARUS: You're too young. <br>
DOCTOR: So are you. <br>
(He laughs, then his body makes painful cracking sounds.) <br>
LAZARUS: In the morning, the fires had died, and I was still alive. I
swore I'd never face death like that again. So defenceless. I would arm
myself, fight back, defeat it. <br>
DOCTOR: That's what you were trying to do today? <br>
LAZARUS: That's what I did today. <br>
DOCTOR: What about the other people who died? <br>
LAZARUS: They were nothing. I changed the course of history. <br>
DOCTOR: Any of them might have done too. You think history's only made
with equations? Facing death is part of being human. You can't change
that. <br>
LAZARUS: No, Doctor. Avoiding death, that's being human. It's our
strongest impulse, to cling to life with every fibre of being. I'm only
doing what everyone before me has tried to do. I've simply been more
successful. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at yourself. You're mutating! You've no control over it.
You call that a success? <br>
LAZARUS: I call it progress. I'm more now that I was. More than just an
ordinary human. <br>
DOCTOR: There's no such thing as an ordinary human. <br>
(Lazarus convulses again.) <br>
MARTHA: (sotto) He's going to change again any minute. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) I know. If I can get him up into the bell tower
somehow, I've an idea that might work. <br>
MARTHA: (sotto) Up there? <br>
LAZARUS: You're so sentimental, Doctor. Maybe you are older than you
look. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm old enough to know that a longer life isn't always a better
one. In the end, you just get tired. Tired of the struggle, tired of
losing everyone that matters to you, tired of watching everything turn
to dust. If you live long enough, Lazarus, the only certainty left is
that you'll end up alone. <br>
LAZARUS: That's a price worth paying. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it? <br>
LAZARUS: I will feed soon. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not going to let that happen. <br>
LAZARUS: You've not been able to stop me so far. <br>
MARTHA: Leave him, Lazarus! He's old and bitter. I thought you had a
taste for fresher meat. <br>
DOCTOR: Martha, no. <br>

(Martha looks down from the passageway in the clerestory.) <br>
MARTHA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Take him to the top. The very top of the bell tower, do you

MARTHA: Up to the top! <br>
TISH: Martha. <br>
