</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> POLLY: Good heavens! <br>
BEN: Blimey, where did all this come from? Well, it was a police box,
wasn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: What are you both doing in here? <br>
POLLY: You dropped your key. <br>
DOCTOR: How dare you follow me into the Tardis! <br>
BEN: The what? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis, sir! This is a vessel for travelling through time
and space! Why did you follow me? <br>
POLLY: I'm terribly sorry if we've annoyed you, Doctor. It was my
fault, I'm afraid. <br>
BEN: Well, what's all this then. <br>
DOCTOR: And stand back from those controls. Those controls are used for
dematerialising. <br>
BEN: Dematerialising? What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: You and this young lady are experiencing it. You are now
travelling through time and space. <br>
BEN: Yeah, well, make sure that I get back by teatime, Doctor. I've got
to get back to my ship by tonight. <br>
DOCTOR: Young man, it's going to be a long time before you see your
ship again. <br>
BEN: Hey? <br>
POLLY: Why? When are we going to land? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. That's the cause of half my troubles through my
journeys. I never know. <br>
POLLY: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: I have no control over where I land. Neither can I choose the
period in which I land in. Oh, now, you see that scanner? That is what
I call a scanner up there. We get a very good view of the outside. <br>
(The Tardis starts to materialise.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. I think we've landed in some sort of caves. <br>
BEN: Yeah, well, thanks for the home movies, Doctor. Now if you'd just
open these doors. <br>
DOCTOR: Wait, wait, wait, young man, we don't know where we are. We
don't know if it's safe or what period we're in. <br>
BEN: Well, I'll take a little bet with you, ay? London, 1966, Fitzroy
Square. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think it's quite normal. Yes, the temperature's all
right. Well, I think you can leave, but watch your step. <br>
POLLY: What a relief. You had me nervous for a minute, Doctor. Come on,
Ben. <br>
(The Tardis doors open.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear, all this distraction. And I really thought I was going
to be alone again. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cave]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Outside the Tardis, Ben can't believe his eyes.) <br>
BEN: Crikey, look! <br>
(Beyond the cave mouth, waves crash onto a beach.) <br>
POLLY: Ben, I'm scared. What's happened to us? <br>
BEN: I don't know. Maybe he's some kind of hypnotist. Pinch me. Ow! Not
that hard. Hey, wait a minute. <br>
(Ben is alarmed to see the Doctor locking the Tardis.) <br>
BEN: What did you do that for? <br>
DOCTOR: I never leave it unlocked, my boy. <br>
POLLY: Doctor, you must take us back. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not going to take you back to London in the Tardis. <br>
BEN: Well, you refuse, hey? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear young man. <br>
BEN: Oh, come on Polly. We'll find our own way back. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose I shall have to chase after them. Quite
incapable of looking after themselves. <br>
(Ben and Polly emerge from the cave onto a narrow strip of sandy
beach.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Beach]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BEN: Look at this! <br>
POLLY: I don't believe it. Hey, isn't it exciting! <br>
BEN: Well, it might be if I wasn't so pushed for time. Come on. <br>
POLLY: But it's a super place. Whee! <br>
(The Doctor watches as Polly dashes off along the shore. He eyes the
rugged cliffs to one side and the incoming tide on the other,
pondering.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder. Yes, I wonder. <br>
BEN: Crumbs. <br>
POLLY: Ben, it's smashing! <br>
BEN: It'd be a lot nicer with a few houses and a bus stop. Got any idea
where we are? <br>
POLLY: Looks like Cornwall to me. <br>
BEN: Cornwall? Are you sure? <br>
POLLY: Looks like it, me handsome. <br>
BEN: Oh, I don't know what this is about. All I know is I've got to get
back to barracks. Come on, it'll take hours from here. <br>
POLLY: All right. Are you coming with us, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes! You may know where you are, my dears, but not
when. Oh, I can foresee oodles of trouble. <br>
(Some way along the beach, Ben and Polly spot a path up the cliffs and
begin to scramble to the top. Amused, the Doctor watches them climb.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear, I suppose I'd better follow them. See that they don't
get into any harm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cliff top]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ben reaches the cliff top first and takes a good
look around.) <br>
BEN: Here, look, there's a church. <br>
POLLY: So we are in our own time, after all. <br>
BEN: Yeah. You didn't really believe all that nonsense about past and
future, did you? <br>
DOCTOR: We can't be too sure, my boy. <br>
BEN: Sure? There are millions of churches like that. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious, most of them have been standing there for
centuries. <br>
BEN: Yeah, well so have we here. Come on, I've got a train to catch. <br>
POLLY: Sorry Doctor, but we'd better find a station. We can talk on the
train. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, talk on the train, child. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Churchyard]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Polly examines one of the gravestones for clues
to their location.) <br>
POLLY: No use, I can't read it. <br>
BEN: You'd think there'd be a few houses or something. I bet it's miles
to a bus. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there doesn't seem to appear any Victorian restoration. I
think it could be any time after the 16th century. <br>
BEN: Only it's not. It's good old nineteen sixty six. <br>
DOCTOR: Well I don't think so, somehow. <br>
(The church door is suddenly flung open. An old man steps out
brandishing what appears to be an antique flintlock pistol.) <br>
LONGFOOT: Hold fast, I say! <br>
POLLY: Oh, please. Would you put that gun away? <br>
LONGFOOT: Hold thy tongue, lad! <br>
(In her trouser suit, with her hair under a cap, the man has taken
Polly for a boy. Cautiously, he approaches the Doctor.) <br>
LONGFOOT: You seem to be a gentleman, but why on foot with these lads
as company? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we stopped aside, sir, on our journey to walk along the
cliffs and unfortunately we got lost. <br>
LONGFOOT: Thou art foreign? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. We don't come from this part of the country. <br>
LONGFOOT: And there's no more of ye than this? <br>
DOCTOR: No, just the three of us. You see, we are travellers looking
for shelter. <br>
LONGFOOT: And you came by road and not from the sea? <br>
DOCTOR: No, sir. Not by sea. <br>
LONGFOOT: Very well. I cannot give thee shelter but I can give thee
sustenance and direction. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
LONGFOOT: Come. <br>
BEN: Well, he's a right one. What gear's he got on? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid you're going to lose your bet, young man. That
gentleman comes from the seventeenth century. <br>
BEN: Seventeenth century?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Church vestry]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Once inside the vestry, the old man offers his
visitors some refreshment.) <br>
LONGFOOT: There's the brandy. <br>
POLLY: Oh, I'll just have a little water, thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: No, we don't touch it. I wonder if you could direct us to the
nearest inn. We seek shelter. <br>
LONGFOOT: In time. In good time. I don't know thee, do I? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don't think we've met before, no.<br>
LONGFOOT: Aye, 'tis true. And you've seen no others on the road? No
ships upon the sea? <br>
BEN: Nah. Didn't see a blind thing. Expecting someone are you? <br>
LONGFOOT: Speak when thee spoke to, sir! <br>
BEN: Well, I was only trying <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Ben, Ben, Ben. No, sir, we met nobody and saw nothing. Are
you, er, expecting some friends? <br>
LONGFOOT: Avery's boys are no friends of mine. Never said that. <br>
DOCTOR: Avery? <br>
LONGFOOT: You know not that name? Oh, then you're the happier for it. <br>
DOCTOR: And you are expecting this Avery? <br>
LONGFOOT: Him? Why, he's been buried these long years past. Ah, but his
spirit rides. Aye, in the dark souls of those who follow in his wake. <br>
BEN: Was he a sailor? <br>
LONGFOOT: Who mentioned sailor? What would I know about the sea? I but
tend this church. <br>
POLLY: Are you a priest then? <br>
LONGFOOT: A priest? The word of God touched me too late, boy. I'm the
Churchwarden here. Name of Joseph Longfoot, Christian. <br>
DOCTOR: You appear to be afraid, sir. Can we help? <br>
LONGFOOT: Ye help? Against Pike's hook? No, thee cannot help. <br>
POLLY: Pike's hook? What's that? <br>
LONGFOOT: The blackest name I know, boy. So never say it to me face
again! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh your hand, sir. Are you in pain? <br>
LONGFOOT: Nah. 'Tis naught. The finger's but bent. It'll mend. <br>
DOCTOR: Dislocated. <br>
(Longfoot cries in pain. The Doctor has quickly grabbed his hand and
twisted the finger back into place.) <br>
LONGFOOT: Cured! Oh, your blessed hand <br>
DOCTOR: Oh 'tis naught, 'tis naught, my dear chap. Have another drink.
We must be on our way. Goodbye. <br>
LONGFOOT: No, no, don't leave me yet. <br>
BEN: Well we must go, we've got to get back to the (gets a Look) to the
beach. <br>
LONGFOOT: The beach? There is no beach. The tide'll be in. <br>
BEN: The tide! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, of course, I remember now. Yes, yes, yes. We have to
wait until the tide recedes.<br>
POLLY: Come on, let's hurry. <br>
DOCTOR: We could, of course, stay, if you wish. <br>
LONGFOOT: No, this is no place for gentleman and lads. Go thy way. Go
quickly while ye may. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ( (A thunderstorm rumbles in the distance.) <br>
BEN: We must be in the seventeenth Century. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, thank you for your diligence, sir, and, the kindness of
your <br>
LONGFOOT: Thou art a real gentleman. Go thy way quickly. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you. <br>
LONGFOOT: Hey! A moment, sir. While at the inn, take care I say. Guard
thy tongue. Think only of thy comfort and thy needs. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. We only need shelter for the night. <br>
LONGFOOT: Heed my words. Be watchful. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Goodbye. <br>
LONGFOOT: Goodbye. Hey! One more word, sir. If you should come this way
again and find me gone, remember these words. This is Deadman's secret
key. Smallwood, Ringwood, Gurney. <br>
DOCTOR: But what to? What's the purpose, sir? <br>
LONGFOOT: It's a secret worth remembering. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LONGFOOT: For this kindness <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you indeed. And I think that's going to be all
right now. Yes. Goodbye, sir, goodbye. Come along. <br>
POLLY: Goodbye. Thank you. <br>
LONGFOOT: God bless. <br>
(Longfoot watches as the Doctor and his companions disappear along the
road, then goes back inside the church. After a moment, a large, bald,
muscular man in sailor's garb rises from his hiding place behind a
gravestone. Drawing a long knife from his belt, he moves to the vestry
door and goes inside.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A mile or so from the church, landlord Jacob
Kewper is looking for the stable boy.) <br>
KEWPER: Tom! <br>
TOM: Aye, Master? <br>
KEWPER: There's business afoot. A message for the Churchwarden tonight.
<br>
TOM: But I, I <br>
KEWPER: Go do as you're bid, boy! <br>
TOM: Aye, sir. <br>
KEWPER: Tell him, tell him that Kewper has had word from friends. <br>
TOM: Down the coast? <br>
KEWPER: A delivery can be expected soon. I'll tell him further when
I've made arrangements. <br>
TOM: I'll tell him. Can I take the mare? <br>
KEWPER: Aye, and go now before the storm breaks. <br>
(Tom scrambles up onto the horse and rides away.)

companions are soaked to the skin by the time they reach the inn. ) <br>
DOCTOR: You're the landlord, I presume, hmm? <br>
KEWPER: Aye, Jacob Kewper. And I've no rooms. We're full. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we only want rooms for the night, my friend. <br>
KEWPER: Strangers are not welcome in these parts. Nor are they always
what they seem. <br>
POLLY: That's more or less what the Churchwarden said. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
KEWPER: Say that? <br>
DOCTOR: The Churchwarden said you could probably put us up for the
night, but it appears that he was wrong. <br>
KEWPER: If he said that, you'll know his name. <br>
DOCTOR: Longfoot, sir, Joseph Longfoot. Now surely that name means
something to you? <br>
KEWPER: A friend of his is welcome, sir, but not so strange travellers.
Your pardon, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Granted, granted. Now, rooms, a meal, something hot for us.
Surely that's possible? <br>
KEWPER: It is, sir, and you'll be wanting dry clothes for the morning
too, ay? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, yes indeed, yes. For the lads. And I think I shall be
able to dry myself out with that lovely fire. <br>
KEWPER: It'll be done, sir. <br>
BEN: Well, my lad? <br>
POLLY: Ha, ha, very funny. I do wish everyone would stop calling me
lad. It does make me feel very odd. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I think it better at the moment, my dear. What would
they say to a maiden in trousers? <br>
BEN: Probably die laughing. <br>
POLLY: You would think it funny, You and your bell-bottom sense of
humour. <br>
BEN: Oh, listen to our little dolly-rocker Duchess, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Watch your tongue, dear boy. <br>
KEWPER: I hope these will serve, man. <br>
POLLY: Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. Come on, help me sort these
out. <br>
BEN: Look, Doctor, what I want to know is, how are you going to get us
out of here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we shall return to the Tardis, my boy, when the tide
recedes and let's hope that we materialize in nineteen sixty six. <br>
POLLY: You don't sound very certain, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid I'm not, my dear. More likely we shall probably
land in the far distant future. <br>
BEN: Oh great! The way things are going there probably won't be a navy
when I get back. <br>
POLLY: Look, Ben, for the moment we're in the seventeenth century,
somehow. We'll just have to like it and lump it. Here you are. <br>
BEN: Oh, okay. Well, it's a nice old pub anyway, isn't it. Yeah, and
I'll bet the beer's better than they serve nowadays. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think they're somewhat suspicious of us. <br>
POLLY: They certainly don't seem to like strangers, do they? <br>
BEN: Yeah, I wonder why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't worry too much about that, my dear, because I
don't think we're going to be here long enough to find that out.

drunkenly to himself.) <br>
LONGFOOT: Who rob great ships on every sea! Who pillage crews without
mercy! <br>

CHERUB: It's nice to see an old shipmate again, eh, Joe? We had good
times aboard the Albatross when you was mate, ay? <br>
LONGFOOT: Them days is gone and past. <br>
CHERUB: Ah, but not forgotten. Not by your old friends, Joe. <br>
LONGFOOT: I'm no friend of yours. I'm Churchwarden here. A Christian
man. <br>
CHERUB: You always had the leaning towards the Good Book. Holy Joe
Longfoot, mate of the Black Albatross. <br>
LONGFOOT: No more I'm not. <br>
CHERUB: We miss you, matey. But most of all does the Captain. <br>
LONGFOOT: The Captain. Captain Pike? <br>
CHERUB: You owes him something matey. He wants what's his. <br>
LONGFOOT: I got naught what his. <br>
CHERUB: If you ain't got it, you knows it's whereabouts. Avery's gold. <br>
LONGFOOT: No Christian man'd touch it. <br>
CHERUB: We ain't all like you, Holy Joe. We ain't all afraid of the
curse that's on it, and it's ours by right. <br>
LONGFOOT: Tis no man's rights. <br>
CHERUB: We'll decide that when we get the loot. <br>
LONGFOOT: Ha! You'll never find it. <br>
CHERUB: Won't we Joe, my old matey? Ain't you gonna to tell me, ay? <br>
LONGFOOT: You can't threaten me. I got friends here, powerful friends. <br>
CHERUB: They need to be to better Pike. <br>
LONGFOOT: Well, don't you think they couldn't. <br>
CHERUB: Where's your friends now, eh? Gone? The old man and his two
lads. What does he know, ay? <br>
LONGFOOT: Know? Know nothing. I directed him on his way. <br>
CHERUB: Where to? Where to, say I? <br>
LONGFOOT: To the inn, for shelter. <br>
CHERUB: Who was he? What's he to you, ay? <br>
LONGFOOT: A passing traveller on his way. <br>
CHERUB: No, matey, I saw you a-whispering something in his ear. What
was you saying to him, ay? <br>
LONGFOOT: Nothing. <br>
CHERUB: Joe, you wouldn't be trying to sell what you know to some
strangers, ay? <br>
LONGFOOT: You can rot in hell! <br>
(Longfoot lunges for his gun, but Cherub is quicker. He throws his
knife with deadly accuracy, the blade burying itself between the old
man's shoulder blades.) <br>
CHERUB: You're a fool, Joe Longfoot. But before you goes to join your
mates, tell me what I want to know. Speak up. <br>
LONGFOOT: (dying) Avery's curse on you, you black villain. <br>
CHERUB: Speak, damn your eyes! It wouldn't be like you to go to Davy
Jones' silent, matey. So I reckon we best get on to that old fella and
get our hooks into him. </font></p>

POLLY: They're fantastic, aren't they? <br>
BEN: Evening. <br>
CUSTOMER: Evening. <br>
BEN: Cheerful lot, Doctor, aren't they? <br>

TOM: No, sir. He was dead. <br>
KEWPER: Dead? How? <br>
TOM: Knifed in the back. He was smiling. <br>
KEWPER: Was he now? <br>

TOM: None as I know of round here. He'd no money and no enemies,
neither. <br>

BEN: What, the Churchwarden? <br>

he passed over. But he spoke to you, didn't he, ay? <br>

JAMAICA: They said that he was the law. <br>
PIKE: Aye, had he a will he'd call the militia, but I doubt he'll do
that. <br>
JAMAICA: Captain, do you think he would lay a trap? <br>
PIKE: It follows, Jamaica. <br>
JAMAICA: So we have to surprise them, Captain. <br>
PIKE: Ye speak straight, Jamaica. They expect us tomorrow night at two
of the clock. <br>
JAMAICA: Then, we must go tonight at one. <br>
PIKE: Jamaica, ye'd have made a fine skipper but you're short on guile.
Any dark of the night they'll expect us. We'll spike 'em. We'll land by
day. Some will go direct to the church and loot the smuggler's horde.
Me and Cherub will seek Avery's gold. <br>
JAMAICA: Aye, Captain, plunder the inn, the village, and the Squire's
fine hall. <br>

tonight or tomorrow night. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh yes, you mean that place where the Revenue man came out of? <br>
BEN: Yeah, but you don't know where it leads to. Smack down to where
the Tardis is. So, all we've got to do is get back to the old church,
go down the passage, and we're away, mate. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, well I know it's really difficult for both you to
understand, but I'm under moral obligation. <br>
BEN: Well, about what? We've got no ties here. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but it's this village. I feel that I might be responsible
for it's destruction, and therefore I must at least try and avoid this
danger until Blake comes back. <br>
BEN: Yeah, but you heard what Blake said. We wouldn't stand a chance
against Pike's mob. They're a right bunch of yobbos. <br>
POLLY: We wouldn't stand a chance. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, wouldn't we, my dear? <br>
BEN: Well, what does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you seem to forget, young man, that I've already met
Pike, and I know something that he doesn't. The clue to the treasure. <br>
POLLY: So, the poor old churchwarden did tell you something. <br>
BEN: Oh, what are you up to now? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think if we are able to find that treasure first, we
might be able to bargain. <br>
BEN: Well, I don't fancy it. I can't see him standing around chatting. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and it's going to give us enough time for Blake to come
back here, and the same time to save the people in this village. <br>

BEN: Oh, a right couple of nut cases you two are. Oh well, all right,
I'll try anything once. <br>

that our luck still holds out. Come on, come on. <br>

below the church. <br>

pauper? <br>

souls of those who come after, seeking and finding the cursed treasure.
<br>

DOCTOR: There is no other way, child. Without either of you they can't
hold a hostage for me to force my hand. <br>
BEN: Yeah, that's true. But, suppose they start on you? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, I've done it before, my dear boy. We must play for time. <br>
(As Polly and Ben edge towards the tunnel, Cherub snatches up Kewper's
fallen pistol and fires wildly at Pike.) <br>
BEN: Right. Come on, back to the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Quickly. Quickly. I somehow don't think that master Cherub will
be the winner. <br>
(The Doctor watches as Cherub edges forward, scanning the gloomy crypt
for Pike who has ducked out of sight. Meanwhile, Ben has opened the
entrance to the secret passage. He ushers Polly inside ahead of him.) <br>
BEN: Right, I'll give you fifteen minutes. If you're not back by then
I'm coming for you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. <br>
(The Doctor retreats into the shadows. Cherub moves warily past a large
tomb, still looking for Pike who suddenly leaps from hiding. He catches
Cherub by surprise, knocking the cutlass from his hand. In desperation
Cherub throws his knife at Pike who dodges aside easily. Now unarmed,
Cherub backs away, then slips and falls back, tumbling to the ground
beneath a large stone angel. Mercilessly Pike closes in for the kill.) <br>
PIKE: Well, my Cherub, you'll not need prayers in this company, ay? <br>
(Pike runs Cherub through with his sword.) <br>
PIKE: Back to your hell hole, Cherub! <br>
(Cherub lies dead at Pike's feet.) <br>
PIKE: Now, old man, the time has come. <br>
DOCTOR: I think we agreed on that point previously. <br>
PIKE: The secret. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Captain, I had every intention of telling you. <br>
PIKE: And that's why ye fled me ship? <br>
DOCTOR: I had no choice. My friends are in danger. <br>
PIKE: Aye, those two lads. Where are they stowed away, sawbones? Is
there another passage out of this crypt? <br>
SQUIRE: Tell him nothing. <br>
PIKE: Still alive, ay, gentleman Squire? <br>
SQUIRE: Aye, I'll live to see you hanged. <br>
PIKE: Think ye so? <br>
DOCTOR: Stop! I made a bargain with you, sir, gave you my word. Don't
you want me to keep it? <br>
PIKE: Aye. That sounds like the foolishness of an honest man. Speak on.
<br>
DOCTOR: I wish to keep my side of the bargain, but I want to change the
terms of my plan. That is, if I may.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Spaniard and David dump their haul of goods
in an untidy pile and sit down to wait for the others. They quickly
become bored and wander up the beach to explore the caves under the
cliffs. They are perplexed to discover a strange tall blue box. Then
venturing deeper into the caves they find the entrance to a tunnel.)
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PIKE: Strange terms indeed. <br>
DOCTOR: I prefer to call them humane, sir. <br>
PIKE: And ye want none of the gold? <br>
DOCTOR: I would rather not touch it. <br>
PIKE: Ha. Heard of Avery's curse, ay? <br>
DOCTOR: I have given you all my reasons. I want no part of the gold,
though perhaps I can deliver it to you immediately. <br>
PIKE: If I keep my lads out of the village? <br>
DOCTOR: There is no need for innocent people to suffer. <br>
SQUIRE: Well said, Doctor. Well said. <br>
PIKE: I like my lads to be happy, sawbones. That way they work well. <br>
SQUIRE: You'd have Avery's gold and our stores, would you, villain?
Will nothing satisfy you? <br>
PIKE: We have an uneasy conscience, have we, Squire? Ye lily-livered
rogue. Ye dare to call to call me villain? <br>
SQUIRE: Oh, I've been a rogue, I frankly admit it. The generosity of
this stranger has shamed me. But I never spilled blood in my villainy.
I beg you as a fellow rogue, if you must, spare my poor villagers. <br>
PIKE: When the fever is in the lads' bones, nothing but blood will
slake it. <br>
DOCTOR: Senseless destruction. <br>
PIKE: Tis by way of being a pastime with us gentlemen of fortune. Why
should I stop them? <br>
SQUIRE: So, you admit it to be difficult, at? You'd rather let them run
mad than test their obedience, ay, Captain? <br>
PIKE: No man defies me and lives to speak of it. <br>
SQUIRE: No, but you'll not give that one order, ay? A highly
disciplined crew, in truth. <br>
PIKE: They'll do as I bid or die of it. <br>
SQUIRE: Would they? <br>
PIKE: Aye, they would. <br>
DOCTOR: Prove it! <br>
PIKE: Aye, I will. When I have the gold. <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose we must trust you? <br>
PIKE: Aye, ye must. And take heed of Cherub yonder, ay sawbones? <br>
DOCTOR: Have no fear, Captain. I am not likely to try and cheat you
just as he did. <br>
PIKE: Out with it, then. Show me the gold. <br>
(Blake and the militia finally sight the church along the cliff top.
Allowing the men a few minutes to catch their breath, Blake divides
them into two groups.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ben leads Polly through the darkness towards the
Tardis.) <br>
BEN: Come on, ducks, we're nearly there. <br>
POLLY: Oh, good. Ow! Oh! <br>
BEN: You okay? <br>
POLLY: Ow, yes. How much further is it? <br>
BEN: I told you, we're nearly there. It's only about another hundred
yards. <br>
POLLY: Well, look. You go back and get the Doctor then. <br>
BEN: But will you be all right? <br>
POLLY: Yes, I'll be fine. Look, hurry. I'll see you back at the Tardis.
<br>
BEN: Okay then. Polly. <br>
POLLY: Yes? <br>
BEN: Put the kettle on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cliff top]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Having briefed the militia men, Blake wastes no
time putting his plan into action.) <br>
BLAKE: All right, Sergeant, off you go. The rest of you come with me. <br>
(Blake plans to trap the pirates in a pincer manoeuvre. The Sergeant
departs, taking one group of men along the road to the church. Blake
will take the other group up into the crypt using the secret passage.
Eager for action, the Revenue man leads his party towards the cliff
path and the beach.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Church crypt]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Now, let me see. The Churchwarden set me a
riddle which involved four names. Ringwood, Smallbeer, Gurney and
Deadman, which should be on that wall, sir. <br>
PIKE: Four names of Avery's crew in the old days. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha! Yes, it's there. Just there. <br>
PIKE: How come those names here? They died on the seven seas, all of
them. <br>
DOCTOR: The original names were changed by the Churchwarden. <br>
PIKE: Aye. Like a marker, ay? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. And unless I am very much mistaken, sir,
this flagstone is at the intersection of those fateful names. <br>
PIKE: Aye, and 'tis loose. Stand aside. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed, I think that is what you seek. <br>
(Wedging his hook into the gap between the flagstones, Pike hauls up
the slab, struggling for a moment before removing it to reveal a dark,
square hole in the floor.) <br>
PIKE: What's this? I see nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, how deep is it? <br>
(Pike reaches down into the hole.) <br>
PIKE: Still nothing, blast your eyes. <br>
(Pike's hook delves deeper.) <br>
PIKE: Nay, nay, what's this? <br>
(It emerges trailing a string of pearls.) <br>
PIKE: Ha! Ha! What now? Ha! What price your damned Avery now? What now,
Squire? <br>
(The sounds of shouting and gunfire come from outside.) <br>
PIKE: What's that? If that is a trap, sawbones, I swear you'll lie
beneath that slab yourself. <br>
(Surrounding the churchyard, the militia have succeeded in catching the
pirates totally by surprise. Befuddled by rum they are no match for the
heavily armed soldiers.) <br>
PIKE: Ahoy there. What's afoot! What in hell's name? Gaptooth, answer!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Churchyard]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The militia continue to press their advantage,
picking off the drunken pirates one by one. Before long, the seafarers
are forced to retreat into the church as the militia charge forward.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Limping out of the tunnel, Polly is delighted to
see the Tardis, but before she can reach safety she is ambushed by
David and the Spaniard. Twisting free, Polly scrambles back towards the
tunnel, screaming.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> POLLY: Ben! <br>
(The Spaniard catches Polly, grabbing her arm and throwing her to the
ground. Hearing noises from the tunnel, David advances into the gloom,
his knife drawn. Up ahead, Ben has heard Polly's screams. As David
creeps past, Ben springs on him from behind. They struggle for a moment
before David is knocked unconscious. Polly fights back, biting and
scratching. Suddenly Ben appears, launching himself at the Spaniard and
knocking him off his feet. Polly twists away, the pirate rises and
turns on Ben, knife in hand.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Weapons drawn, Blake and his men move past the
Tardis into the cave. Up ahead, the Spaniard has got the better of Ben
and stands over him, knife raised. There's a gunshot, and the Spaniard
falls dead, shot in the back by Blake.) <br>
POLLY: Mister Blake, thank heavens. <br>
BLAKE: Now stand aside, boy. Our work lies above. Keep close and in
command. <br>
BEN: Hang on, Blake. I'm with you. Polly, go on back to the Tardis and
wait for us there, okay? <br>
POLLY: All right. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The last of the pirates have been forced to
retreat towards the crypt, where a mass of men now fight on the steps.
Below the, Pike struggles to retrieve Avery's treasure from it's hiding
place, shouting encouragement to his men.) <br>
PIKE: Fight, ye black-hearted sons of traitors. There's gold for ye all
if we can but board the Albatross. <br>
(At the back of the crypt, the Doctor tries to locate the mechanism to
open the secret passage. Unexpectedly, the tomb slides aside, revealing
Blake and the rest of his men.) <br>
BLAKE: Pray, stand aside, good old man. In the King's name! <br>
(Blake leads his men to join the fighting. As Pike realises what is
happening, he stands and brandishes his cutlass at the Doctor.) <br>
PIKE: Sawbones, ye Neptune's curse! Ye've laid a trap and for that
you'll die by the pike. <br>
(The Captain lunges towards the Doctor, trying to shove his way through
the fighting.) <br>
BEN: Come on, Doctor, now let's get out of here. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I must try and help the Squire. <br>
(The Doctor edges around to where the Squire is propped up against a
pillar, his clothes bloodied and his face very pale.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank heavens you're still alive, sir. Let's try and get
him out of here. <br>
BLAKE: Captain Pike, surrender I say. <br>
(The last of Pike's are being cut down around him.) <br>
PIKE: And give over this treasure? Never! <br>
(He darts over to where the Doctor is tending the Squire's wounds.) <br>
PIKE: Sawbones, I'm coming for ye. See if your magic will help you now.
<br>
(With the last of his strength, the Squire struggles to his feet to
help fend Pike off. The Captain looms over the Doctor.) <br>
PIKE: Here's an end to ye, sawbones, damn your eyes. <br>
(The hook flashes. Blake's bullet finds its target, thanks to the
Squire who managed to grab Pike's arm before it delivered the killing
blow. As Blake and the Squire watch Pike draw his last breaths, Ben and
the Doctor manage to slip into the secret passage unnoticed. The pirate
Captain falls # heavily, his haul of Avery's treasure scattering around
him. The route is dark and treacherous, but by now Ben knows the tunnel
very well and helps the Doctor down towards the Tardis. Blake helps the
Squire to his feet.) <br>
BLAKE: Thank ye, Squire. The day is ours. <br>
SQUIRE: Yes, quite so, quite so. I think we've managed very well, you
and I. <br>
BLAKE: But where's the old man? I would offer my gratitude to him. <br>
(Looking around him, Blake realises that the Doctor and Ben must have
left using the secret passage.) <br>
BLAKE: Godspeed, old man.

POLLY: So they're all dead then, the ones who wanted the treasure. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, superstition is a strange thing, my dear, but sometimes it
tells the truth. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
POLLY: Where will we go to now, Doctor. Will we go forward or back in
time? <br>
DOCTOR: I have no idea. I have no control over such matters. <br>
BEN: Well, it better be 1966 or I'm in dead trouble, Doctor. Well,
anyway, wherever it is, it can't be as bad as going back to them days. <br>
