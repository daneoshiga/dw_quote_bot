<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TURLOUGH: I'm scared. This place is like a maze.
Where am I supposed to be going? <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Your function is to obey, not question. <br>
TURLOUGH: I may not have must time. I don't think they trust me,
especially Tegan. <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: The roundel behind you. <br>
(Turlough touches one at head height, then the one beneath it.) <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: That one. Open it. <br>
(The roundel hinges down to reveal circuitry in the wall.) <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Operate the blue switches. Now you'll be able to remove
the space-time element from beneath the console. <br>
TURLOUGH: Which switches will release the Tardis to my control? <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Do only as I say. <br>
TEGAN [OC]: Turlough! <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Quickly, close the roundel. <br>
TURLOUGH: Now what do I do? <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Go to the console room. <br>
TURLOUGH: And? Where have you gone? <br>
TEGAN: Who were you talking to? <br>
TURLOUGH: Oh, no one. I was singing. Not very well, I'm afraid. <br>
TEGAN: Why didn't you answer when I called? <br>
TURLOUGH: I'm very sorry, I didn't hear you. <br>
TEGAN: You're up to something, I can feel it. <br>
TURLOUGH: I'm simply looking around. The Tardis is so very large. <br>
(The roundel drops open again.) <br>
TEGAN: What have you been doing? Have you touched anything? <br>
TURLOUGH: You look so sweet when you get angry. <br>
TEGAN: I'm being serious. What have you been doing? <br>
TURLOUGH: Nothing. You're being foolishly and unjustifiably suspicious.
Tegan, why do you dislike me so much? <br>
TEGAN: You're unreliable. <br>
TURLOUGH: You hardly know me. <br>
TEGAN: I heard the way you were talking to the Doctor. <br>
TURLOUGH: Being friendly hardly makes me unreliable. <br>
TEGAN: It's the way you were doing it. <br>
TURLOUGH: Oh, you would prefer I used your sledgehammer tactics? <br>
TEGAN: At least I'm honest. <br>
TURLOUGH: Being rude isn't honest. Neither is overreacting. If I choose
to smooth the way with a smile and a soft phrase, that doesn't make me
unreliable. Charm, the way I use it, is to disagree agreeably. <br>
TEGAN: You were using it to deceive. <br>
TURLOUGH: Oh, you're so typical of your planet, reduced to shouting if
you can't have your own way. <br>
TEGAN: I am not! <br>
TURLOUGH: No? You seem unable to grasp that there are other approaches.
To smile before asking. <br>
TEGAN: Don't patronise me, Turlough. <br>
TURLOUGH: I'm simply relating what I think. <br>
TEGAN: Turning an argument around is something you're very good at. <br>
TURLOUGH: Listen to yourself. You're so concrete in the way you think.
Why can't you just agree to differ? <br>
TEGAN: I think you're dangerous. <br>
TURLOUGH: I think we should try and be friends. <br>
TEGAN: I'm going to tell the Doctor about the roundel. <br>
TURLOUGH: Do so, but you'd only make a fool of yourself. I travel in
the Tardis too, now. I have no desire to kill myself. I had no reason
to open that roundel. Where are you going? <br>
TEGAN: To show you to your room. <br>
TURLOUGH: We're friends? <br>
TEGAN: Not yet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (While Nyssa is doing some experiment in the
girl's room, Tegan shows Turlough to Adric's old quarters.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Looks like a kid's room. <br>
TEGAN: It was Adric's. <br>
TURLOUGH: Who? <br>
TEGAN: Doesn't matter. <br>
TURLOUGH: I've had enough of children, what with that awful school on
Earth. <br>
TEGAN: You can change things if you want. <br>
TURLOUGH: Right, all this can go for a start. <br>
TEGAN: It's your room. Do what you like. <br>
(Tegan leaves with the Kinda necklace. Turlough comes out, rolling up
his sleeves.) </font></p>

TEGAN: The brat, Turlough. <br>
NYSSA: He'll settle down. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The console room is deserted when Turlough sneaks
in and takes the Guardian's crystal from his pocket. It glows.) <br>
TURLOUGH: It's repaired itself. <br>
GUARDIAN [on scanner]: Concentrate. You have work to do. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Nyssa and Tegan's room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: What are you doing? <br>
NYSSA: Synthesising an enzyme. I seem to need the practice. <br>
TEGAN: You've done it before. <br>
NYSSA: Adric did the calculation for me. My own figures aren't as good,
as you can see. <br>
TEGAN: I'll see if I can find his notes, before Turlough destroys them.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Turlough is trying to pull a component out of the
console base.) <br>
TURLOUGH: What will this do? <br>
GUARDIAN [on scanner]: You are touching the heart of the Tardis. Rip it
free! <br>
TURLOUGH: What happens to me? <br>
GUARDIAN [on scanner]: You will be safe. I am ready to lift you away. <br>
(The console starts beeping and flashing, and the time rotor stops
moving.) </font></p>

GUARDIAN [on scanner]: Continue. <br>
TURLOUGH: I'm trying. It won't move. <br>
GUARDIAN [on scanner]: The break-up is beginning. I can sense it.
Remove the space-time element! <br>
TEGAN [OC]: Turlough? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There is a hazy mist in front of Tegan.) <br>
TEGAN: Turlough? Oh, no. Doctor! <br>
(The mist effect is entering the girl's room through the wall. Nyssa
turns to stare at it.) <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
TEGAN: Quickly! <br>
(The Doctor runs up to the mist.) <br>
TEGAN: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: We're in trouble. I'll explain later. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Turlough gets out from under the console and
grabs the crystal just before the Doctor and Tegan run in.) <br>
DOCTOR: What was Nyssa working on? <br>
TEGAN: Nothing that could have caused this. <br>
DOCTOR: The rotor's jamming. Well, there's a safety cut out. <br>
(The Doctor pulls it out.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Is Nyssa safe? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we'll see. I'm trying to refocus the exterior viewer on
the interior of the Tardis. <br>
TEGAN: It's just a mess. <br>
DOCTOR: Dimensional instability, that's the danger. Nyssa! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Nyssa and Tegan's room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR [OC]: Nyssa, can you hear me? <br>
NYSSA: Yes! <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Stay well back. There's nothing you can do. Nyssa? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The scanner view is looking over Nyssa's shoulder
into the swirly effect.) <br>
TEGAN: What's that? I saw something just for a moment. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. The outside universe is breaking through. <br>
TEGAN: Look! <br>
(The image of a skull is visible.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Nyssa and Tegan's room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (As Nyssa hugs her notebook, her apparatus starts
to explode. She squeals and turns away.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Look behind you, Nyssa. <br>
(The image of a skull is on a solid door which is opening.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Go through, Nyssa. It's your only chance. <br>
TEGAN: Where are you sending her? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but if she stays in the room, she'll die. <br>
(Nyssa takes a final look over her shoulder, then the screen goes
white.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nyssa, if you can hear me, </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Nyssa walks through into a corridor.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Keep moving. Keep moving, Nyssa. Stay ahead of it. If you
don't, it will kill you. <br>
(Nyssa drops her notebook and runs.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The image on the scanner clears to show the
girl's room. There is a background thrumming sound.) <br>
TEGAN: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
TURLOUGH: Where does that door lead to? <br>
DOCTOR: Another spacecraft. <br>
TEGAN: Look! <br>
(The door is beginning to close.) <br>
(The Doctor pushes past Tegan and they all run out.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Nyssa and Tegan's room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor throws a metal chair into the
remaining gap to keep the door open.) <br>
TEGAN: Where did the other spacecraft come from? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis found it. There's a fail-safe. On impending
break-up, it seeks out and locks onto the nearest spacecraft. <br>
TEGAN: You never mentioned it before. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it never worked before. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Space liner</b><b>]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor crawls under the chair into the
corridor. Tegan starts to follow.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TURLOUGH [OC]: Tegan? <br>
(Turlough crawls into the corridor. Suddenly the chair is pulled from
the gap and the door slams shut.) <br>
TURLOUGH: I wonder how that happened. <br>
(The skull motif disappears and it becomes part of the corridor wall.) <br>
TEGAN: It seems we have no choice. We go on. <br>
(Further on, the Doctor finds handprints on the wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: What have I sent you into, Nyssa? <br>
(A spaceship docks. There is that whirring sound again.) <br>
TEGAN: Come on, we can catch up with the Doctor. Come on! <br>
(Nyssa hides below a staircase as she hears someone coming. It's the
Doctor. He sees her curled up into a little ball.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nyssa. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor! <br>
(She runs into his arms.) <br>
NYSSA: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's some sort of old passenger liner. <br>
NYSSA: And those things? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, some people have the strangest ideas about decor.
Come on, let's get back to the Tardis. <br>
(Elsewhere, there is an explosion as someone blows a hole in a
bulkhead, then comes through wearing an enormous clear space helmet.
She speaks to the man following her.) <br>
KARI: Check the air seal. <br>
(The hole has filled up with foam.) <br>
OLVIR: Secure. <br>
(In yet another corridor -) <br>
TEGAN: I'm positive that was Nyssa calling. <br>
TURLOUGH: You heard something. Your imagination did the rest. <br>
TEGAN: Maybe. <br>
TURLOUGH: Let's go back. <br>
TEGAN: No! <br>
(They walk round a corner.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Oh, no. <br>
(A metal contraption spots them and starts chirruping.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The two newcomers enter. Kari checks the
atmosphere then they both remove their helmets before going down the
steps to look at the equipment.) <br>
KARI: The whole ship's rigged to run on automatic, yet there's
atmosphere. It doesn't fit the briefing at all. <br>
OLVIR: So what? We're only here for the cargo. <br>
KARI: Would it really surprise you if there weren't any? This ship is
dead. </font></p>

breach.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. I don't remember this. We must have taken a wrong turn. <br>
NYSSA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: A massive plug. The hull must have been damaged at some time. <br>
NYSSA: It's still soft. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Come on, we'll try, er, this way. </font></p>

Meanwhile, the raider undocks from the spaceship.) </font></p>

TEGAN: Find a pry bar. Now! <br>

refuses to glow. He picks up Nyssa's notebook.) <br>
TEGAN [OC]: Turlough, it's moving! <br>

was.) <br>

TEGAN [OC]: Turlough! <br>

TEGAN: Turlough <br>

back.) <br>
TEGAN: Help me! <br>
(Turlough pulls her out of their grasp and the door closes again.) <br>

DOCTOR: I think not. <br>

DOCTOR: Stop bluffing. You haven't got a chance. Listen to the engines.
Alignment manoeuvres. We're docking with another ship. <br>
KARI: Then I'm asking you, will you take us off this ship? <br>
DOCTOR: If you put the guns away, please. <br>

announcement from Terminus Incorporated. <br>

the centre of the universe, yes? Now, imagine this ship in flight.
Suddenly the pilot finds he has an enormous amount of unstable fuel on

factor, hmm? <br>

DOCTOR: It only appears simple because the circumstances were exactly
right. <br>
KARI: Well, if what you're saying is right, why wasn't Terminus
destroyed in the explosion? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the pilot time-jumped the ship forward before realising
how unstable the fuel was. The resulting shockwave must have caught up
with him, boosting the ship billions of years into the future. <br>
KARI: Killing the pilot and damaging the second engine. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
KARI: If there was a second explosion, would it have the same effect as
the jettisoned fuel? <br>

the second would undoubtedly destroy it. </font></p>

GARM: Do something for me. Destroy the box. Set me free. <br>
(The Doctor picks up the signal box and smashes it on the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rest. You've earned it. Come on. <br>
(The Doctor picks up his jacket and leaves with Kari.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Terminus]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KARI: What now? <br>
DOCTOR: Disconnect the control lines to the engines. <br>
(They meet Valgard and his gun.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, whoever you are, we haven't got time for <br>
VALGARD: Silence. Move. <br>
(Nyssa and Olvir are on a lower level.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're taking a very narrow view of all this. <br>
NYSSA: It's the Doctor. <br>
(Nyssa and Olvir hide as Valgard brings the Doctor and Kari down the
stairs.) <br>
VALGARD: I want to stay alive. If that's a narrow view, then you're
right. <br>
DOCTOR: You're quite happy to see things go on as they are. <br>
VALGARD: Happy? This is Terminus. No one's happy here. Staying alive is
all that counts. <br>
DOCTOR: Things could change. <br>
NYSSA: Over here! <br>
(Valgard turns.) <br>
OLVIR: Here! <br>
(Olvir kicks the gun out of Valgard's hand and Kari picks it up.) <br>
KARI: Freeze! <br>
DOCTOR: Nyssa, I've been so worried. <br>
NYSSA: I'm fine. Doctor, I've made a fantastic discovery. The cure for
Lazar disease works. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you know? <br>
NYSSA: Because I've been cured myself. <br>
OLVIR: It seems I was wrong. <br>
NYSSA: The system is far from safe. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you think it could be? <br>
NYSSA: With the Garm's help, yes. It's only his lack of free will which
has prevented him from doing anything about it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he has it now. <br>
VALGARD: She's sick. She doesn't know what she's talking about. <br>
NYSSA: With changes, Terminus could work, become a proper hospital. <br>
VALGARD: The Company isn't interested. <br>
NYSSA: Are you, though? And the other Vanir? <br>
VALGARD: Even if we were, it's not possible without Hydromel, and it's
the Company who control that. <br>
NYSSA: But if you had an endless supply of it, you'd be free of their
control, wouldn't you? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Bor wakes up, muttering.) <br>
BOR: Am I dead yet? <br>
SIGURD: No. <br>
BOR: Oh, funny, I could have sworn that. But still, it's a relief. I am
hoping for something rather better on the other side. Sigurd <br>
SIGURD: Try to sleep. <br>
BOR: Sleep? It's all I can do to keep awake for more than a minute. <br>
SIGURD: Valgard! <br>
VALGARD: Shush. I've got some people with me. <br>
SIGURD: What's going on? <br>
(They cross the room.) <br>
VALGARD: Come in. <br>
(The Doctor, Nyssa, Kari and Olvir enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: Where is it? <br>
VALGARD: Here. <br>
SIGURD: Now wait a minute. <br>
VALGARD: They say they can free us from the Company. <br>
SIGURD: You believe that? <br>
VALGARD: You know anybody harder to convince? <br>
DOCTOR: It's locked. Olvir, may I borrow your laser? <br>
SIGURD: Now if this is just some madcap scheme for getting back at
Eirak, then you've got another thing coming. <br>
VALGARD: Wait. <br>
(The Doctor lasers the padlock on the stack of Hydromel and give Olvir
the gun back. Then he takes out a box and opens it.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're the expert, what do you think? <br>
(Nyssa examines a phial.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, er, while we're sorting things out here, perhaps you'd be
so good as to cut the control lines to the engines. I'd hate anyone to
start the sequence manually. <br>
KARI: Of course. Come on. <br>
(Kari and Olvir leave.) <br>
NYSSA: It's crude stuff, probably organic. <br>
DOCTOR: Think you can synthesise it? <br>
NYSSA: I might even improve on it. <br>
SIGURD: Well, how's this supposed to free us from the Company? <br>
NYSSA: Terminus Incorporated only control you because they supply you
with Hydromel, but if you produced your own <br>
VALGARD: Here on Terminus. <br>
SIGURD: Is it possible? <br>
NYSSA: Of course. <br>
SIGURD: But the Company would send troops. They'd destroy us. <br>
NYSSA: With the current reputation Lazar disease has, would any sane
soldier come here? <br>
VALGARD: Of course they wouldn't. <br>
SIGURD: I suppose not. <br>
NYSSA: Then help. <br>
SIGURD: All right. Why not? <br>
BOR: Oh, Sigurd. <br>
(Nyssa gives Sigurd a phial of Hydromel.) <br>
SIGURD: I'm with you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> OLVIR: Are you sure these are the right cables? <br>
KARI: According to the Doctor. <br>
OLVIR: It's what you said about this ship. I'd hate to end the universe
by mistake. <br>
KARI: Give me the gun. <br>
OLVIR: No, no, I'll, I'll do it. Just wanted to be certain. <br>
(Kari stands behind Olvir as he zaps the cables on the wall. The engine
goes dark.) </font></p>

EIRAK: I want it found. Without the signal box we've got no control
over the Garm. <br>
(Then he sees Valgard.) <br>
VALGARD: Pleased to see me? I want you to meet some people. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do? I'm the Doctor, and this is Nyssa. <br>
EIRAK: All right, Valgard, what do you think you're doing? <br>
VALGARD: I think you owe me something. <br>
(Sigurd and Bor stand beside him.) <br>
SIGURD: A small matter of your position here. <br>
VALGARD: If I bring back the intruders, your position is mine,
remember? There he is. <br>
BOR: We all think it's time for a little chat. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, before you start, perhaps one of you could show us
the way to the damaged engine. There's still a great deal to be done. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Kari looks at the bundle of severed wires.) <br>
KARI: Terminus will never move again. <br>
OLVIR: Have you given any thought as to how we're going to get home? <br>
KARI: I'm about to. <br>
(Meanwhile, Valgard is escorting the Doctor and Nyssa.) <br>
DOCTOR: It'll be good to see the Tardis again. <br>
NYSSA: And Tegan. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it'll be nice to know she's safe. Tegan! <br>
TEGAN: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing? <br>
TEGAN: I was trying to reach you. Turlough went back to the Tardis on
his own. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you not to follow me. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor, say you're pleased to see her. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm pleased to see her but she shouldn't have
followed us. <br>
TEGAN: You don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we'll talk about it later. Valgard? <br>
TEGAN: Why does he never listen? <br>
NYSSA: He has a great deal to do. <br>
TEGAN: There always is. <br>
NYSSA: Tegan, I have to tell you something. <br>
DOCTOR: Now it's important you inform the authorities about what's been
going on here. Make it impossible for Terminus Incorporated to
retaliate. For example, you must make contact with the pick-up ship. <br>
VALGARD: What ship? <br>
DOCTOR: The one that takes the cured Lazars away. Well, the Garm will
know all about it. <br>
VALGARD: We no longer have any control over him. <br>
DOCTOR: Then speak to him, win his confidence. You'll find him very
agreeable. <br>
TEGAN: Doctor? Doctor, talk to Nyssa. <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
NYSSA: I'm not coming with you. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
NYSSA: There's too much to be done here. <br>
TEGAN: Tell her she must. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you can't stay. It isn't safe. Certainly not until the
Vanir have sorted out how they're to run Terminus. <br>
NYSSA: And with my skills, I can help them. <br>
TEGAN: We need you, too. <br>
NYSSA: I've enjoyed every moment of my time on the Tardis, and I'll
miss you both, but here I have a chance to put into practice the skills
I learnt on Traken. <br>
TEGAN: Please, Nyssa. <br>
NYSSA: I'm adamant. Please, let us part in good faith. <br>
DOCTOR: You do fully understand the commitment you'll be undertaking? <br>
NYSSA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And that life here will be very hard. <br>
NYSSA: I am fully aware of that, but I want to stay. <br>
DOCTOR: Then you're a very brave person. I wish you every luck. <br>
(Nyssa kisses the Doctor on the cheek.) <br>
TEGAN: She'll die here. <br>
NYSSA: Not easily, Tegan. Like you, I'm indestructible. <br>

TURLOUGH: I feel ill. <br>
