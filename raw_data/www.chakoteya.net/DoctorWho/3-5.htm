single eye where our mouth is, is walking along carefully. The Tardis
materialises and new girl Dodo Chaplet dashes out, wearing a crusades
style tabard. She sneezes. Steven follows her.) <br>
STEVEN: Just where do you think you're going? <br>
DODO: Out. <br>
STEVEN: Out? <br>
DODO: Yes, I thought I'd get some fresh air. Somebody opened the door
and <br>
STEVEN: But nobody said you could go out. <br>
DODO: Do they have to then? <br>
STEVEN: Well, of course they do. <br>
(Dodo is walking away.) <br>
STEVEN: Look, Dodo, you don't know what you might have found out here.
No gravity, poisoned atmosphere, all sorts of things. Look, stop
prancing around over there. What happens if you get lost? <br>
DODO: I catch a bus back. <br>
STEVEN: A bus? Look, what are you talking about? I mean, just where do
you think you are? <br>
DODO: Ah! Bet you thought you'd caught me, didn't you? Bet you thought
I didn't know. Well, I do. <br>
STEVEN: You do? <br>
DODO: Of course I do. <br>
STEVEN: What, this place? I mean, you recognise it? What, with all
these strange animals and flowers and things? <br>
(Toucan in the trees.) <br>
STEVEN: Well, you can't have been here before. <br>
DODO: Yes I have. It's just outside London. I came here once with the
school. It's called Whipsnade. <br>
STEVEN: Just outside London? Look, wait a minute. I mean, it can't be. <br>
DODO: Yes, it is. I bet if you go down that path there, you'll come to
the American Bison and the Tea Bar. <br>
STEVEN: Look, we don't even know that we're on Earth. <br>
DODO: Earth? Earth? Well, it couldn't be anywhere else now, could it?
Hey, look Steven, that proves it. That's a chameleon. <br>
STEVEN: What this? <br>
DODO: And here's a monitor. Look, that's a Locust. There, what did I
tell you? <br>
STEVEN: Look, how do you know all this? <br>
DODO: I learnt it at school. There's nothing you can tell me about
nature, simply nothing. <br>
(A creature calls) <br>
STEVEN: Having second thoughts? <br>
DODO: No! I just don't remember Whipsnade being so rowdy, that's all. <br>
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Improbable as it may seem, dear boy, I think the child,
Dorothea <br>
DODO: Dodo! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, of course, my dear. Dodo is right. <br>
STEVEN: What? You mean it is Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can't tell you just yet. All I can say is that it's
more likely to be Earth than anywhere else and it's very strange
indeed. You know, I've been taking a look at my instruments in there
and it's really very strange. <br>

Another of the one-eyed people hands the paper to a human at a higher
level desk. A young man is escorted in. Every human is wearing a
garment made of strips of cloth hanging from a thick collar.) <br>
COMMANDER: Prisoner, you've been found guilty of extreme carelessness
in carrying out your duties. By leaving open a wide valve in the heat
exchange unit, you could have caused an explosion that would have been
fatal not only to the human race, but also to our friends, the Monoids.
As your commander, Galactic law gives me wide powers in such cases. The
safety of our people must be preserved at all costs. In these grave
circumstances, the lightest sentence I can pass is one of
miniaturisation. Prepare the Minifier. Sentence will be carried out
immediately. The prisoner will be retained at micro-cell size, to be
re-constituted in approximately seven hundred years time, when it can
no longer be a danger to us. Does the prosecution accept this sentence?
<br>
(A man signs to a Monoid, who nods.) <br>
ZENTOS: We do. <br>
COMMANDER: Has the defence anything further to say on the prisoner's
behalf? <br>
(A young woman runs up to the desk.) <br>
MELLIUM: Father, anyone can make mistakes. He's not likely to do it
again. <br>
COMMANDER: My child, we are the Guardians of the human race. You know
our responsibilities cannot be taken lightly. Under Galactic law, the
only alternative punishment would be expulsion. <br>
MANYAK: Sir, the prisoner accepts the verdict and thanks you for your
clemency in not imposing a harsher sentence. <br>
COMMANDER: Very well. Proceed. <br>
MELLIUM: Goodbye. <br>
(The young man is escorted by two Monoids into a booth. He crouches on
the floor as a Monoid presses a switch and he shrinks smaller and
smaller until he cannot be seen. One of the humans enters the booth and
lifts a small tray containing the miniaturised convict off the floor.
He walks away with it. The prosecution Monoid signs to Zentos.) <br>
ZENTOS: My learned friend wishes to thank you, sir, on behalf of the
Monoids, for the care you take of us all. <br>

(An elephant walks through the trees.) <br>
DODO: Hey, look at him then. <br>
(The travellers go over to him.) <br>
STEVEN: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's just as I said. It's all very, very strange. That is
an Indian elephant. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, I know. What difference does that make? What does it
prove? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, dear boy. <br>
DODO: Flowers from America, birds from Africa, a snake from Brazil and
now an elephant from India. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly, my dear. <br>
STEVEN: It's a jungle incorporating things from all over the world. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, my boy. Yes, and top of everything
else, it's a jungle without a sky. <br>
DODO: Hey, look at that then. <br>
STEVEN: No sky? <br>
DOCTOR: No sun, no clouds, merely a metal roof radiating some kind of
light. <br>
STEVEN: It's extraordinary. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and plus something else. <br>
DODO: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: The earth, this, this ground we're standing on. It appears to
be trembling. <br>
DODO: It is more elephants coming? <br>
STEVEN: An earthquake building up? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's too regular for that. No, it's more of a mechanical
vibration. Yes. <br>
STEVEN: Look. <br>
DOCTOR: Extraordinary. <br>
STEVEN: In what circumstances do you get all these things together? I
mean, animals and vegetable life from different continents? <br>
DODO: With a metal roof and all this shaking? <br>
DOCTOR: There's only one thing that strikes me. This could be some kind
of indoor nature park. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, but on this scale? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, improbable dear boy, but possible. Definitely
possible. <br>
DODO: But are we on Earth or, or <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm? <br>
DODO: Choo! (Dodo sneezes again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, bless you my dear. <br>
DODO: Oh, thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: You have a handkerchief, I hope? <br>
DODO: Of course I have. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, use it, my child! We must do something about that
cold of yours. That reminds me, why are you dressed in these stupid
clothes? Have you been footling about in my wardrobe? Is that what it
is? What do you think you're playing at, crusades? <br>
DODO: I'm not playing at anything. Is it all right to wear, or do I
have to ask permission for that as well? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you do my dear. Now you take care of them because you
never know when we might use them. Now, I suggest we take a last look
round and we'll get you off to bed. <br>
DODO: Oh, you're not going to send me home, are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Home? Ho, ho! What an idea. I couldn't send you home even if I
wanted to. <br>
DODO: Oh, that's all right, then. I think I'm beginning to enjoy this
space travel or whatever it is.

tractor unit hauling a crate. Others are signing to each other.
Children are playing. A Monoid signs to Zentos. He goes over to the
Commander and Mellium who are looking at a design.) <br>
ZENTOS: Commander? <br>
COMMANDER: Yes, Zentos? <br>
ZENTOS: A strange report from the jungle. The Monoids acquaint us of
intruders. <br>
COMMANDER: Intruders? But how can that be? How could they have entered
it? <br>
ZENTOS: I've no idea. I'll try and trace them. <br>
MELLIUM: But surely it's impossible for anyone to be in the jungle that
we don't know about? Well, where will they have come from? <br>
COMMANDER: I don't know. Perhaps when we see them? <br>
(An overhead view of Steven and the Doctor comes up on the wall
viewscreen.) <br>
ZENTOS: Here they are. <br>
COMMANDER: They look like human beings, but they can't be. We accounted
for everyone. <br>
ZENTOS: Shall we not arrest them and bring them here and question them?
<br>
MELLIUM: Father, look. It seems to be their spaceship. It is an unusual
design. <br>
COMMANDER: Are we sure this is nothing to do with the Monoids? <br>
ZENTOS: Quite sure. It was they who reported it. <br>
COMMANDER: Good, then you're right. They must be questioned. But
Zentos, not arrested. Invited. <br>

pictures! <br>
(She's found some rock paintings.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, fab, hmm. My dear child, if you're going to be with us for
any length of time, you'll have to do something about that English of
yours. <br>
DODO: What's wrong with it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's terrible, child. Oh, it's most irritating. Well, look at
that now. Isn't that extraordinary? Ah, very interesting. It looks like
a zebra with two heads. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, well, that could be the imagination of the artist. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, perhaps and perhaps not. What then. Yes, we've already
established this place as illogical. Why shouldn't there be animals
with two heads? <br>
STEVEN: No reason at all, except that the more we see of it, the less
like Earth it becomes. <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
DODO: What's that? Do you think somebody's seen us. <br>
STEVEN: There's only one way to find out. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! <br>
(Steven goes off and sees that there are Monoids at the Tardis.) <br>
STEVEN: You were right. It is an alarm. They've found the Tardis. I
can't say I like the look of them. <br>
DODO: What's that? <br>
(The alarm stops.) <br>
STEVEN: They're coming this way, searching for us. <br>
DODO: There's a kind of cave there. <br>
STEVEN: Go on, you go ahead. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. What do they look like, dear boy? <br>
STEVEN: Terrifying. Is this is Earth, it's no longer inhabited by human
beings. <br>

STEVEN: Bless you. Remind me never to take you out again when you've
got a cold. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, let's try and get back to the Tardis. Take care. This
might be dangerous. <br>

STEVEN: Quiet! (Dodo sniffles.) What's the matter? Are you crying? <br>
DODO: No, me nose is running! <br>

DOCTOR: Why, yes, of course. Yes! I know where I am now. Yes, indeed! <br>
STEVEN: It looks like some sort of city, factory? <br>

STEVEN: Yes. <br>
COMMANDER: Well, how are you able to make your spaceship enter ours? <br>
STEVEN: It isn't just a spaceship. It can travel anywhere in time or
space. <br>
ZENTOS: Why have you chosen to come here? <br>
STEVEN: Well, we didn't. It has a mind of its own. <br>
COMMANDER: I don't understand. Experiments to pass through the fourth
dimension were undertaken in the twenty seventh segment of time. They
were unsuccessful. How can anything so crude <br>
STEVEN: Look, I told you before. The Doctor's the one who will tell you
what you want to know. <br>
(The Commander signs to a Monoid.) <br>
STEVEN: May I ask a question also? <br>
ZENTOS: No! <br>
COMMANDER: Why not? We're all friends here. <br>
STEVEN: Look, is this really a spaceship? This city and all that
surrounds it? <br>
COMMANDER: Yes, indeed. <br>
(He goes over to a console and points at a schematic. The city is at
the edge of a huge circle.) <br>
COMMANDER: Here we are. <br>
STEVEN: That's the biggest we've ever seen. Look, who are you and these
creatures that serve you? <br>
COMMANDER: Like you, we come from the Earth. The origin of the Monoids
is obscure. They came to Earth many years ago, apparently from their
own planet which was dying. They offered us their invaluable services
for being allowed to come on this joint voyage. <br>
STEVEN: And where you are going? <br>
COMMANDER: To Refusis Two. The Earth also is dying. We have left it for
the last time. <br>
STEVEN: The last time? <br>
COMMANDER: Yes. In a short time it will burn and be swallowed in the
pull of the Sun. <br>
STEVEN: Then we must have journeyed forward millions of years. <br>
ZENTOS: You yourself, I take it, are human? <br>
STEVEN: Why yes, of course. <br>
COMMANDER: Why do you doubt him? <br>
ZENTOS: They could be Refusians sent here to intercept us, to sabotage
our mission. <br>
STEVEN: Refusians? From the planet you're headed for? <br>
COMMANDER: Explain. <br>
ZENTOS: We only know them as intelligence's that inhabit that planet.
They might have a way of assuming human bodies, of using them to pass,
to mingle amongst us! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish, rubbish. With all our imperfections, I can assure
you, sir, if you were to cut my skin, I would bleed, the same as you
would. <br>
STEVEN: That's right. <br>
(Dodo sneezes.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you see, complete with chills. <br>
ZENTOS: Chills? <br>
DOCTOR: A virus fever which used to be quite common to the human being.
<br>
COMMANDER: And cured so long ago we've forgotten what it was like.
Fascinating! It's like history coming to life. Tell me, Doctor, if you
cannot direct your spacecraft, your journeys must take you to some
strange places. <br>
(Zentos has been signing to a Monoid.) <br>
MELLIUM: What were you telling him? <br>
ZENTOS: I wish to know more of the traveller's spacecraft. <br>
MELLIUM: You do not trust the travellers? <br>
ZENTOS: I know nothing of them. Your father trusts them. <br>
MELLIUM: He knows no more than you. He simply has faith. <br>
ZENTOS: So have I, in my own eyes and ears, and machines tell fewer
lies than men. <br>
DOCTOR: Including the Daleks. <br>
COMMANDER: Nero, the Trojan wars, the Daleks. But all that happened in
the first segment of time. <br>
DOCTOR: Segment? To use your phrase, sir, what segment are we in now? <br>
COMMANDER: The fifty seventh. <br>
DOCTOR: Good gracious! We must have jumped at least ten million years. <br>
STEVEN: When do you expect your journey to end? <br>
COMMANDER: Not for a long time. Neither I, nor my daughter Mellium, nor
Zentos, will ever see the planet. That pleasure is reserved for our
children's children, many years hence. <br>
STEVEN: How long from now? <br>
COMMANDER: Using your measurement of time, seven hundred years. <br>
DOCTOR: Seven hundred years, but why travel that far? Surely <br>
COMMANDER: Only Refusis has the same conditions that we had on Earth.
Atmosphere, water, the right temperature. <br>
STEVEN: Has anyone ever been there? <br>
COMMANDER: No. Our knowledge is based purely on audio-space research. <br>
STEVEN: No wonder you had to bring everything. At least two of each, I
suppose? <br>
DODO: Like the Ark? <br>
COMMANDER: The Ark? <br>
DODO: Yeah, Noah's ark. You know, two by two. The flood. <br>
COMMANDER: I'm afraid I don't know. But we do have the Earth's full
population, human and animal. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but where, sir? I can only see but a few people. <br>

MELLIUM: This way. <br>
COMMANDER: While I am sure that you would be more interested in the
technicalities of our control deck. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, indeed! <br>
COMMANDER: Then I'll leave you with our chief controller, Manyak. He
will explain everything. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Now tell me, that noise we heard just now. Was that a flight
adjustment? <br>
MANYAK: No, sir, refueling pause. <br>
(Mellium, Steven and Dodo are by the base of a giant statue.) <br>
MELLIUM: Here it is, Homo Sapiens. Started on Earth, due to be
completed just before the landing on Refusis. <br>
STEVEN: What? Seven hundred years to sculpt one statue? <br>
MELLIUM: Yes, we're constructing it by hand using the ancient methods.
It's for our children and our children's children, so that they can
watch it grow gradually as time goes by. <br>
(Dodo has to stand on a ladder just to be able to reach the toe of the
statue.) <br>
DODO: What is it made of? You can't scratch it, can you? <br>
STEVEN: Dodo! You'll have to watch her. She'll have the whole thing
down. <br>
MELLIUM: It's a substance called gragarium rock. It'll last for ever.
Here's the finished design. (A human holding the spherical Ark in his
right hand.) <br>

deck with a Monoid lying on it. The Commander is holding his head in
pain.) <br>
ZENTOS: Commander, the strange disease, the fever is spreading among
the Monoids. <br>
COMMANDER: I can hardly hear you, Zentos. It's so hot. What's happened
to the temperature? <br>
ZENTOS: Commander? The Commander, too. He has the strange fever. The
fever brought by the strangers! <br>
MELLIUM: What is it? What's wrong? <br>
ZENTOS: Stay away from them, Mellium, and from your father. <br>
MELLIUM: But what is it? <br>
COMMANDER: I don't know. I'm not sure. But Zentos is right. Stay away. <br>
(Dodo feels the Commander's forehead.) <br>
ZENTOS: Don't touch him! <br>
DOCTOR: We may be able to help. <br>
DODO: It's nothing to worry about. His temperature's a bit high, that's
all. It's just a fever. It can only be a cold. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you realise what this means, dear boy? <br>
STEVEN: What's all the fuss about? The man's caught Dodo's cold, that's
all. <br>
DOCTOR: All? All? These people, this generation, have never experienced
the common cold for the simple reason it was wiped out many generations
ago before they were born. They have no resistance to it. <br>
STEVEN: What'll happen? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't quite know, I don't know. But it might be fatal and we
shall be to blame. Yes, it's all our fault and I should have foreseen
it. <br>
ZENTOS: Did you hear that? Did I not try and warn the Commander? I told
you these people were evil. <br>
DODO: But it wasn't my fault. How was I supposed to know? <br>
MANYAK: The sick Monoid. He's dead. <br>
ZENTOS: Seize them! All of you listen! The success of all we stand for,
everything aboard this spaceship is suddenly endangered by the strange
fever. A fever brought by these strangers in our midst! <br>
DOCTOR: But I <br>
ZENTOS: I invoke the special Galactic law against them. Hold them, take
them into custody, and later they will be made to suffer for the crime
that they have committed! <br>
STEVEN: Look, listen to us! <br>
ZENTOS: Take them away! <br>

MELLIUM: What about my father? <br>

case, it was pointless leaving.

an infection from one age to another, or even one planet to another? <br>

ZENTOS: There is the crux of the matter. Do you expect us to believe
that nonsense, that you manage in that ridiculous machine called the

anything to go by, this segment of time, far from being one of the most

MONOID 1: According to the history scan you brought a strange fever
that killed many of our ancestors. <br>
DODO: But we also helped to find a cure, didn't we? I mean, the Doctor
did. <br>
MONOID 1: He thought he did. <br>
DOCTOR: And what do you mean by that? <br>
MONOID 1: You controlled the immediate impact of the fever, but a
mutation of it developed later on that sapped the will of the humans. <br>
DODO: You mean that it was our fault that you took over because of the
fever? <br>
MONOID 1: In part. <br>
STEVEN: There were other reasons? <br>
MONOID 1: The main reason was the Guardians themselves. They were a
simple people. They actually encouraged the research from which we
developed our voice boxes and heat prods. They were totally unprepared
for the conflict when it came. <br>
DODO: What happened to them? <br>
MONOID 1: Many were killed. The rest are prisoners. A fact that you
will shortly see for yourselves! Two, take them away to the security
kitchen and then call a Grand Council. <br>

travelled and the Earth itself no longer exists, so where could these
so-called humans come from? <br>
VENUSSA: From Earth, but as it was millions of years ago. Well, they
travel through time. <br>
DASSUK: That's impossible. I think you've been a prisoner a little too
long. <br>

went away again. Well they were the first people to call this ship the

MONOID 1: Good. Then we shall leave shortly.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven and Venussa cover something with blankets.)
<br>
VENUSSA: Maharis, what's the news from outside? <br>
MAHARIS: The Monoids are preparing to leave. <br>
(Steven takes him to one side while Dassuk goes for the open door) <br>
STEVEN: And you still think they'll take you? <br>
MAHARIS: Why not? We can serve them on Refusis as well as here. Just a
moment. Where's Dassuk? <br>
VENUSSA: Asleep. <br>
(The blankets in the corner.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Dassuk hides until Maharis leaves and the coast
is clear of Monoids, then opens the door.) <br>
DASSUK: Hurry. I don't think he saw me, though we haven't much time. <br>
VENUSSA: What first? <br>
STEVEN: Well, we agreed. First we've got to find that bomb that the
Monoids left behind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control deck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MONOID 4: The moment we land, then we decide
whether One is to stay our leader. If Refusis is dangerous, we must
return to the Ark before it is destroyed. <br>
MONOID 3: There is still no contact from Two on Refusis, One. <br>
MONOID 1: Never mind that. We will now go there ourselves. Give the
signal. <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
STEVEN: What's that? <br>
VENUSSA: The main landing order. <br>
STEVEN: So they're not going to wait any longer.

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Three capsules leave the Ark and head for the

MAHARIS: Steven was right. The Monoids have all gone. Every one of
them! <br>
DASSUK: What now? <br>
STEVEN: Just find that bomb. <br>
(Everyone scatters to search.) <br>
STEVEN: (to Venussa) We've got to find a way of getting back to
Refusis. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The capsules have landed.) <br>
MONOID 1: Good. Everything seems to be quiet. And from this moment on,
this planet is ours! <br>
MONOID 3: Look. <br>
(They go to the destroyed lander.) <br>
MONOID 3: There is the reason why Two failed to complete his message to
us. <br>
MONOID 1: A reason and a warning. We must find who destroyed that
launcher, and then destroy them! <br>
(The Doctor and Dodo watch One and Three leave.) <br>
MONOID 4: One made a mistake in bringing us here. We will have to wait
for our chance, then challenge him and return to the Ark. There is
still time before it is destroyed by that bomb that has been left
behind. Come. We must not let One and the others get out of our sight. <br>
(The rest of the Monoids leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now. <br>
(Dodo and the Doctor get into an empty capsule.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEVEN: It could be anywhere. The corridors, in
the jungle over there, in the cultivated lands. <br>
VENUSSA: We'll find it. We must! <br>
STEVEN: What's that? <br>
VENUSSA: It's one of the launchers trying to make contact. We're in
contact. Who is that? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: This is Refusis contacting spaceship Ark. <br>

is? <br>
DOCTOR [on viewscreen]: No, I do not, but I'm going to find out from
the Monoids. In the meantime, I'll send back some of the launchers to
the Ark. Now, continue with the search! <br>
STEVEN: All right, you heard what he said. Let's get started.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DODO: But Doctor, how are you going to talk to the
Monoids and how are you going to send the launchers back to the Ark? <br>
REFUSIAN [OC]: Yes Doctor, how? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm glad you heard that. You know, these launchers are
simple to operate and I would like to suggest, my friend, that you fly
them back to the Ark. <br>
REFUSIAN [OC]: Me? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the Monoids won't know who's taking them. And as for me
talking to them, or speaking to them, as you say, well, the problem's
quite simple. <br>
REFUSIAN [OC]: Very well. We will do as you suggest. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you.

Monoids return.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, so we meet again. Welcome to Refusis. <br>
MONOID 3: Don't kill them. One will want to question them. You will
come with us. <br>
DOCTOR: Delighted, delighted. <br>
(63 watches the capsule take off.) <br>
MONOID 3: Who is it that travels in that launcher? We have seen no one
since we have been here. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, to tell the truth, neither have we.

STEVEN: Have you checked this? <br>
MAHARIS: What's the use? There's nothing there. <br>
STEVEN: Look, there's no point standing around moping just because the
Monoids promise you something and then failed you. You've got to do
something to save yourself. <br>
MAHARIS: I believed in them! <br>
DASSUK: Steven, come quickly. <br>
STEVEN: Why? What's happened? <br>
DASSUK: One of the launchers has returned from Refusis. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MONOID 1: Doctor, where are the Refusians? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I haven't seen one. <br>
MONOID 1: You step out of the launcher, a moment later it was flown
away. It must have been manned by someone. I must find the answer. <br>
MONOID 3: Do you think they will talk, One? <br>
MONOID 1: If they don't, they will die. <br>
MONOID 4: Perhaps. But it would seem that we will die as well. <br>
MONOID 1: Do you seek to challenge me, Four? <br>
MONOID 4: You have led us to this planet and placed us all in danger. <br>
MONOID 1: If that is the way you feel, then return to the Ark. <br>
MONOID 4: We will. Only there we have to face the danger that you
created. The fission device. <br>
MONOID 1: Leaving you with but one problem, that of getting rid of it.
But since it is inside the statue, and the statue itself is so heavy, I
think that you will find the problem of disposal is not so easy. <br>
MONOID 4: Those of you that wish to stay in this world of the unknown,
will side with One. But those who care for the future of the Monoids
must come with me. <br>
(Four Monoids leave.) <br>
MONOID 3: Will you let them go? <br>
MONOID 1: No. <br>
(He takes 77's weapon from him.) <br>
MONOID 1: We'll destroy them in the open, and we will deal with you and
the Refusians later. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's very kind of you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control deck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEVEN: Well, I think we should split up. Some of
us should go back to Refusis to help the Doctor and Dodo, whilst the
rest stay here and try to deal with that bomb. <br>
DASSUK: Yes, that's a good idea. <br>
MAHARIS: Is it? Why should any of us stay and risk being blown up? <br>
STEVEN: Because the Earth's population trays, everything else that
represents Earth life, all these things have to be taken to Refusis
later. <br>
VENUSSA: Steven's right. That's why our forefathers started this voyage
through space in the first place, seven hundred years ago. <br>
MAHARIS: But we're alive. Why should any of us die for an idea that
they thought of? <br>
VENUSSA: You've served too long with the Monoids, Maharis. You no
longer belong to us. Let him go with the landing party. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, all right. Dassuk, you take the launcher. Go with him,
Maharis. And you two. Contact the Doctor as soon as you can. I'll stay
here. <br>
DASSUK: All right. What about you, Venussa? <br>
VENUSSA: I'll stay too. <br>
DASSUK: Right. <br>
(Dassuk leaves.) <br>
STEVEN: You could have gone with them. <br>
VENUSSA: They don't need me. You don't know the Ark. You will need me
to help you find the bomb. <br>
STEVEN: Let's try behind that central scan.

MONOID 4: What is the meaning of this? We are going back to the Ark. <br>
MONOID 1: That is now against my orders. <br>
MONOID 4: Your orders? You have given too many and delivered them
unwisely. Now they mean nothing to us. <br>
MONOID 1: You have had my last warning. Do as I say. <br>

into one of the launching bays. <br>

our planet. <br>
DASSUK: Thank you. <br>
REFUSIAN [OC]: But one thing you must do. <br>
VENUSSA: What's that? <br>
REFUSIAN [OC]: Make peace with the Monoids. <br>
DOCTOR: He's right. A long time ago, your ancestors accepted
responsibility for the welfare of these Monoids. They were treated like
slaves. So no wonder when they got the chance, they repaid you in kind.
<br>
REFUSIAN [OC]: Unless you learn to live together, there is no future
for you on Refusis. <br>
DASSUK: We understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you must travel with understanding as well as hope. You
know, I once said that to one of your ancestors, a long time ago.
However, we must be going. Goodbye. <br>
(They get on a transporter and leave. Again) <br>
VENUSSA: Do you think we'll ever see them again? <br>
DASSUK: Perhaps, but if we don't our children will, or our children's
children. <br>
VENUSSA: If we were to tell them the story, do you think they'd believe
us, or would they just dismiss it as a legend? <br>
DASSUK: We'll make them believe it. <br>
