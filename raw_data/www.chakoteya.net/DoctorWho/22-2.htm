bleak landscape. Inside one, a bare-chested young man is manacled to
the wall.&nbsp;Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001064/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jason Connery</a>, just
before Robin of Sherwood made him really famous. A CCTV camera turns
to face him, then another larger device does the same. He twists his
body out of the way of a beam, but the second gets him right in the
midriff. His torture is watched on a wall screen by a woman. A man
enters.) <br>
ARAK: Not him again. <br>
ETTA: Yeah. <br>
ARAK: ComDiv must be running short of people to laserise. <br>
ETTA: Yeah. <br>
(The young man on the screen dodges another beam.) <br>
ARAK: Rubbish. He's not hurt, he's only acting. <br>
ETTA: Never. <br>
(Another beam hits the young man. The man goes to a cabinet and removes
a food tray.) <br>
ARAK: Is this all? <br>
ETTA: It's what they sent. <br>
ARAK: How can I work, dig on this? It's not enough to fill a
clinker-mole's belly, let alone a working man's. <br>
ETTA: There's shortages, maybe more to come. <br>
(They sit at the small table.) <br>
ETTA: Governor's punch-in vote tonight. <br>
ARAK: Voting, voting. This Governor calls a punch-in every time he
wants to change his trousers. The sooner he gets ruled out, the better.
<br>
ETTA: What would the next one do different? <br>
ARAK: Everything. Anything. What is this I'm eating, Etta? <br>
ETTA: How should I know? I just get it out the dispenser. It didn't
have a label on it. <br>
(He pushes the tray away so Etta pulls it towards herself. He grabs it
back.) <br>
ARAK: Get off. I want to chuck it at the screen when your beloved Sir
Governor begs my vote. <br>
ETTA: Attacking ComTec property can bring loss of viewing rights. Way
you're thinking, you'll be in that one's place. <i>(laughs) I'd
like to see how far you get in the Dome of Punishment. You'd not even
survive the first distort section. <br>
ARAK: Marriage to you prepares me to survive anything.</i> Why
have they stopped? Oh, it's pathetic. When did they last show something
worth watching, eh? When did we last see a decent execution. <br>
ETTA: Last week. <br>
ARAK: What? <br>
ETTA: The blind man. <br>
ARAK: That was a repeat. <br>
ETTA: It wasn't. You're thinking of that infiltrator. He wasn't blind.
Not at the beginning, anyway. <br>
ARAK: Yes, he was. I'm going to sleep, anyway. <br>
ETTA: Can't. You've got to vote. <br>
ARAK: Do it for me. <br>
ETTA: Do you want PolCorps calling here? Do you, Arak? <br>

DOCTOR: I haven't told you what I've done, yet. <br>

DOCTOR: What is the matter with you? <br>
PERI: Every time you sound confident nowadays, something terrible seems
to happen. <br>
DOCTOR: Does it? What do you mean? <br>
PERI: Well, since we left Telos, you've caused three electrical fires,
a total power failure, and a near collision with a storm of asteroids.
Not only that, you've twice managed to get yourself lost in the Tardis
corridors, wiped the memory of the flight computer and jettisoned three
quarters of the storage hold. You even managed to burn dinner last
night. <br>
DOCTOR: I have never said I was perfect. <br>
PERI: If you recall, last night I was supposed to have a cold supper. <br>
DOCTOR: That was an unfortunate accident. <br>
<i>PERI: Before each and every unfortunate accident, you've
said in a loud, confident voice, that's it. And to be honest, Doc, I am
getting tired of clearing up the mess and being thrown around the
Tardis like the teddy bear of some psychotic baby. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you finished, Perpugilliam? <br>
PERI: For the moment. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a good thing I like you. <br>
PERI: Right now, the feeling isn't mutual. <br>
DOCTOR: What more do you want? I've cleared up as you requested. I've
stabilised the chameleon circuit. <br>
PERI: So now what will we materialise as? <br>
DOCTOR: A police box. I think. <br>
PERI: Well, better than a pyramid or Nelson's column. <br>
DOCTOR: We have never materialised as Nelson's column! <br>
PERI: We did as a pyramid. On the frozen plains of Ewa Nine, remember? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a good thing I'm a tolerant man, because sometimes you
push me too far. <br>
PERI: You're the most inconsistent and intolerant man I've ever met. <br>

DOCTOR: It seems that function is about to become defunct too. <br>
PERI: Terrific. <br>
DOCTOR: The problem is, Peri, we are faced with a conundrum wrapped up
in a dilemma. <br>

SIL: Who else will buy from you if my corporation withdraws its
contract? <br>
GOVERNOR: We shall have to find other outlets, I should think. <br>
SIL: You are not a rich planet. Zeiton is all you have to sell. <br>
GOVERNOR: There are other exports. We're expanding into entertainments
and communications with some success. <br>
SIL: How? <br>
GOVERNOR: The Punishment Dome. We sell tapes of what happens there. <br>
SIL: Ah, that is enterprising. Your idea, Governor? <br>
GOVERNOR: Yes. <br>
(Sil starts to quiver with excitement.) <br>
SIL: Are they very disturbing, these videos you sell? <br>
GOVERNOR: They show what befalls those who refuse to obey the orders by
which the people of Varos must live. <br>
SIL: Torture? Blindness? Executions? <br>
GOVERNOR: All the functions of the Punishment Dome are recorded as
warnings to miscreants everywhere. <br>
SIL: But they entertain as well as instruct? <br>
GOVERNOR: You must ask my Chief Officer. He is responsible for ComTec
Division product. <br>
SIL: I will hope to help organise your sales exports, if you consent to
lower your Zeiton price. <br>
GOVERNOR: I can't. I'm sorry. <br>
SIL: Then my patience is exhausted and spent totally. <br>
(The Chief Officer enters.) <br>
CHIEF: The people are anxious for a decision on the new price of our
product. <br>
GOVERNOR: Negotiations between ourselves and Galtron Mining are far
from complete. The broadcast must be delayed. <br>
CHIEF: Impossible. The rules must be obeyed by Governors as well as
prisoners. <br>
GOVERNOR: What is the difference? <br>
CHIEF: What point have you reached, gentlemen? <br>
SIL: Stalemate, on contract, royalties, everything. <br>
CHIEF: But surely, a little movement regarding cost? <br>
SIL: Already I have gone beyond my authority to meet the stubbornness
of this Governor. <br>
GOVERNOR: We must have an increase of price. We must. <br>
SIL: I will wait. Perhaps the next Governor will be more sensible of
reality. <br>
GOVERNOR: I am the Governor. You deal with me. <br>
SIL: But tonight you must place yourself at the mercy of the votes of
your people. Should they not agree with your stubborn stance, you may
be obliterated. <br>
(Sil finds this prospect most appealing. <i>His slaves wheel him
away.) <br>

(The scanner shows stars and distant galaxies.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stalled, in the equivalent of a galactic lay-by. See? <br>
PERI: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Midway between Cetes and Sculptor. Materialised into actual and
temporal void. <br>
PERI: Yes, but why won't it move? <br>
DOCTOR: This is the one problem the Tardis cannot overcome. Like all
things in the universe, she cannot move without power and energy. <br>

further austerities, food dole, work feed cuts. They won't accept it.
The vote against me will be overwhelming. We know what that will do. <br>
CHIEF: The Constitution requires that Governors who fail to please the
majority must suffer. It is the price of failure. <br>
GOVERNOR: Even until death. I wish I had something to offer the people
of Varos. Something to give them hope. <br>

ETTA: Shut your mouth. <br>
GOVERNOR [on screen]: Seven credits per unit of zeiton ore mined is
what I asked. <br>
ARAK: Well, you won't get it. <br>
ETTA: One more yak out of you, Arak, and you're down on my ViewStat
report as a subvert. <br>
GOVERNOR [on screen]: Surely that is not too much to ask. <br>
ARAK: I'm entitled to an opinion. <br>
ETTA: Entitled to a vote is all. <br>
ARAK: I know how I'll use that, then. <br>
GOVERNOR [on screen]: Viewers of Varos, I ask that we agree to hold out
for what is a fair price for our principal marketable resource, that of
zeiton ore. Those who wish to fight alongside me for a prosperous
tomorrow, vote Yes to a ten percent reduction of our food rations.
Those who wish for full bellies today and nothing to eat tomorrow have
the option to punch their No button. <br>
ARAK: Right. <br>
(Arak goes straight to the No button by the screen. Etta votes Yes. <br>
The results come up on the screen in front of the Governor. Yes -
633,156. No - 987,627. The Governor places his arms on the chair and
clamps hold them still. Governor's recommendation defeated, says the
computer. The Governor is subjected to a pulsing green light which
clearly hurts. Etta can't bear to watch.) <br>
ARAK: He's lost! Go on, pour it on and on. <br>
ETTA: No, no. <br>
ARAK: Yes, he's going. Yes, he's snuffed it! <br>

alive.) <br>
ARAK: Oh. Well, next time. Next time for sure. <br>
ETTA: He's strong. That's three losing votes in a row! <br>
ARAK: Yeah. Next vote will see him blasted out for sure. No one's ever
taken four bashings from that cell disintegrator thing. <br>

again to reach agreement before I must communicate with my executive
council? <br>

SIL: I find the G-forces of this Varos size world quite excessive. <br>
GOVERNOR: I'm so tired. <br>
CHIEF: I warned the people would not accept yet more rationing cuts for
whatever the reason. <br>
(The Chief Officer brings a metal chair for his Governor, in contrast
to his own padded leather chair.) <br>
GOVERNOR: This system of referendum, how much longer can I survive? <br>
CHIEF: One more vote? <br>
BAX: Governor, may I suggest you do something to please, to entertain,
to please the people. Just to give yourself time to recover your
strength. Why not give them the life of the rebel Jondar? After all,
it's his death or yours. <br>
GOVERNOR: It would have to be something different. <br>
BAX: I thought perhaps by laser obliteration, sir, by a concentrated
build-up of power. Neutralise the Q switch. That way, the random laser
emitter builds up to a giant pulse of light, an explosion of focused
laser energy that would wipe the prisoner out of existence. <br>
GOVERNOR: We have never shown that style of despatch. <br>
CHIEF: Too quick. It would be over too soon. We'd never be able to sell
so swift an execution. <br>
BAX: It's the uncertainly. No one knows quite when the power will blow.
We could get at least ten minutes of tension out of his apprehension
and fear. <br>
CHIEF: It's novel, I suppose. <br>
BAX: I'm sure the video of his execution would sell. You said we must
export or die. <br>
GOVERNOR: Yes. Yes, I did. Very well, arrange it. And Bax <br>
BAX: Sir? <br>
GOVERNOR: Thank you for the suggestion. <br>
(Bax goes to his control panel.) <br>
BAX: End random pulses. Conserve CB. Neutralise Q switch. Activate
viewer warning of imminent public execution. <br>

his mouth and one eye enters.) <br>

BAX: Sir? <br>

require shots of her witnessing her husband's obliteration? <br>

all is that the transitional elements have lost the capacity to

JONDAR: Plenty of other prisoners the authorities would be happy to rid
themselves of. <br>
DOCTOR: Why are they so anxious to eliminate you? <br>
JONDAR: Because I was curious. I used to maintain the surface shuttle
cars. One day I was required to deliver the cars to the dome where the
Chief Officer lives. I was never allowed in. Security was excessive,
even for Varos. That day my curiosity became too much. I hid inside a
car, went inside to where the elite live. Luxury, richness, wealth. I
didn't see much, but enough to know that a giant deception had been
played against all of our people except for the favoured, the very
favoured, few. I pretended I'd seen nothing. <br>
ARETA: The suspicion that perhaps he had was enough to bring him to the
Dome of Punishment as fodder for their displays of cruelty and
violence. <br>

misery, which has for so long been the lot of its people. <br>

statements made from the scaffold. <br>
DOCTOR: I will discuss nothing, reveal nothing, until I have proof that
Peri and Areta have been released unharmed from the cell mutation
experiment. <br>
SIL: He has nothing to reveal. He is lying. An Amorb agent who wishes
only to usurp our worthy Galatron contracts by rashful promises. <br>
GOVERNOR: Until I can hear what each of you has to say or offer, the
matter rests without decision. Should the Doctor be lying, he will find
the next noose about his neck will sever his head from his spinal
column. But should he be accurate in his appraisal of the potential
worth of our zeiton ore, I shall want to know, Sil, why you and your
company have been duping Varos these many generations. <br>

DOCTOR: That beam that radiates, what source of energy is it derived
from? <br>
QUILLAM: The nuclear bombardment beams release all the power latent in
the recipient's mind. If the changelings see themselves as unworthy,
they can become serpentine or reptilian. She, for instance, must wish
to fly away from trouble as would a bird. <br>
GOVERNOR: It's an offshoot of our mining research technology. We found
our miners growing fur and claws, the better, they thought, to dig

disintegrator beams pour down, kill Peri, please, to spare her from the
rehabilitators. <br>
(No reply.) <br>
GOVERNOR: I tried. We will die together. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The patrol car dies in its tracks.) <br>
JONDAR: It's no good. <br>
DOCTOR: Where are we? <br>
JONDAR: I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder why we've been allowed to progress so far into the
dome without being apprehended? <br>
ARETA: This whole place is cracking up. The guards must be as confused
as we are. <br>
JONDAR: I think we're into what they call the endgame. Not many
trialists reach this stage. <br>
DOCTOR: Could that be where the escape exit would be? <br>
JONDAR: Presumably. <br>
DOCTOR: What are we waiting for? I must be cautious. From now on, I
believe the mind games and jolly tricks are over. What we're entering
now could be the area of most dangerous ordeal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Arak and Etta's rooms]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CHIEF [on screen]: This is a forced vote. I have
explained my actions. The Governor must now explain his, and then you,
my fellow Varosians, must use your vote and decide. <br>
(In the corridor, a misty green light with occasional searchlights
makes the Doctor, Areta and Jondar feel very happy.) <br>
GOVERNOR [on screen]: I have addressed you many times, and you have
seen other Governors approach the ultimate crisis point of their
regime. The time of forced vote now is upon me. I am not afraid to die.
<br>
ARAK: Good. <br>
(Arak presses both No buttons.) <br>
ETTA: Hey! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Governor's arms are clamped to his chair.
Peri backs away as the green light begins its deadly work. The Governor
makes his final statement in great pain.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Your system is wrong. We sell ourselves cheaply for nothing
to such as Sil and his like. I see my words mean nothing, that you all
wish the harsh system of Varos to continue. So be it. <br>
PERI: Isn't there anything I can do? <br>
GOVERNOR: No. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Arak tries pressing the Vote No buttons again.) <br>
ETTA: No! You've messed up the whole system. They'll be coming round
for you. Voting twice, and using someone else's voting box? Both
criminal offences. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Governor's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PERI: We must find the Doctor. <br>
MALDAK: He's in the End Zone. <br>
GOVERNOR: He must be seeking the safe exit. <br>
PERI: Well, let's go there, then. <br>
GOVERNOR: Not that way. There has to be another route. <br>
MALDAK: There is. The ventilation ducting. <br>
GOVERNOR: There's an outlet here. <br>
MALDAK: I once spent eight days down there searching for escaped
prisoners. I know it only too well. <br>
PERI: Come on, then. </font></p>

them on. They start to follow.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! Be gone. You are shadows, insubstantial ghosts. We are
real, you are not. <br>
(The images disappear. Jondar steps forward but the Doctor stops him.
There is a deep pit of something very nasty bubbling in front of them.)
<br>
DOCTOR: I think perhaps we should try another route. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Chief Office and Quillam enter.) <br>
SIL: Where is Governor? Why is he still at life and liberty? Why is
everything no longer as it was? <br>
CHIEF: We are still the power. <br>
SIL: Why not you both prove it? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[End Zone]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor, Areta and Jondar find a fresh body in
the corridor.) <br>
ARETA: What did he die from? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. His neck's swollen as if to burst. Poison,
perhaps? <br>
JONDAR: Did he take it, or been given it? <br>
ARETA: Doctor! <br>
(The two emaciated men in loincloths leap in behind them, growling.) <br>
JONDAR: Fellow prisoners. <br>
DOCTOR: This is no time for speeches, Jondar. <br>
ARETA: What shall we do? <br>
DOCTOR: Run. <br>
(The chase begins. Meanwhile, Maldak leads Peri and the Governor
through the ventilation ducts, which are big enough for them just to
have to stoop a bit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stop, Areta! <br>
(Areta stops just short of an area draped with foliage.) <br>
DOCTOR: If you value your lives, don't touch those tendrils. In, but
don't allow one touch. <br>
(They climb over the small wall and go inside. Their pursuers stop.) <br>
JONDAR: What do they want? Why do they want us? <br>
DOCTOR: I noticed a pile of bones back there. I think we were on their
dinner menu. <br>
(One of the cannibals touches a tendril and collapses. His friend drags
him away as our heroes make their way further into the area. There is a
distant hum of an electric motor.) <br>
JONDAR: Shush. Patrol car. <br>
ARETA: We're trapped. <br>
JONDAR: What do we do? <br>
DOCTOR: The best we can. Do you think you could attach this string to
that clump of vines without killing yourself? <br>
(Jondar does as Peri, Maldak and the Governor leave the ducts for a
corridor. The Chief Officer and Quillam are driven up to the Doctor,
Areta and Jondar by two guards.) <br>
QUILLAM: I see you have a keen interest in the flora of Varos, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a passing fancy. <br>
CHIEF: It'll pass faster than you think. Kill them! <br>
QUILLAM: Wait. This man has insulted me. He must suffer for my
humiliation. <br>
CHIEF: This is no time for revenge. Kill them quickly! <br>
(The camera on the wall follows the Chief and Quillam as they move
towards the fringe of vines.) <br>
QUILLAM: And deprive Varos of an example of how traitors are dealt
with? The cameras are still functioning. Let the show begin. I want to
hear them scream till I am deaf with pleasure. To see their limbs twist
in excruciating agony. Ultimately their blood must gush and flow along
the gutters of Varos. The whole planet must delight in their torture
and death. <br>
DOCTOR: An excellent scenario. Not mad about the part. <br>
QUILLAM: Proceed! <br>
DOCTOR: Now! <br>
(Jondar pulls the string hard and releases the vines that were tied up
out of sight. They swing forward and get both Quillam and the Chief
Officer, and the two guards in the face and neck. They die quickly but
noisily.) <br>
DOCTOR: Let's get away from here. <br>
(The Doctor leads Areta and Jondar back to where they entered the area
of vines. Maldak, Peri and the Governor run up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stay where you are! Don't move! <br>
PERI: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Poison. One touch and (slit throat gesture.) <br>
PERI: Poison ivy? <br>
DOCTOR: Something like that. <br>
(He rolls over the low wall to safety.) <br>
DOCTOR: It'd give you a very nasty rash. <br>
PERI: Oh, Doctor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sil is using the communications system.) <br>
SIL: Plenipotentiary Sil to Galatron Occupation Force Commander. Urgent
need for instant invasion of planet Varos to consolidate our interest.
React immediately! <br>
(Invasion proceeding, await further report comes up on the screen.) <br>
SIL: Water me. I must look my best to assume the emperorship of this
primitive planet. <br>
(A slave hoses Sil down.) <br>
SIL: Gently, gently. Take extreme care with my person if you wish to
retain your skins. Ah, that's better. Mirror, mirror, mirror. Come on,
mirror! Mirror! Oh yes, I will wear the mantle of power so, so
handsomely. <br>
(The Governor enters, followed by the Doctor, Peri and Maldak.) <br>
SIL: Ah, there you are. I called you here to inform you that a force of
invasion is about to land. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? From where? <br>
SIL: My home planet. From Thoros Beta. You had innumerable chances to
settle with me, Governor. Now your people will work for me. I will be
Governor of Governors. I will be Viceroy of Varos. The confirmation of
my colonisation force. <br>
(The Governor reads the new text on the screens.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Report of zeiton-7 traces found on asteroid Biosculptor.
Invasion of Varos cancelled. <br>
SIL: Argh! <br>
DOCTOR: The ways of the ruler are fraught with uncertainty, are they
not, Sil? <br>
SIL: Certainly. Certainly. <br>
GOVERNOR: There's more. New supplies of zeiton-7 required urgently.
Start shipments immediately. Pay any price asked by Varosians. Well,
shall we commence negotiations from a reasonable base? <br>
SIL: Of what? Of what? <br>
GOVERNOR: Twenty credits per unit. <br>
SIL: Twenty? Twenty? Argh! <br>
DOCTOR: I think he needs more than water, Peri, eh? <br>
(Groan, Perrier...) <br>
PERI: Like cyanide. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh come, Peri, where's your sense of justice? <br>
PERI: What about that transmogrifier thing he put me in? <br>
DOCTOR: I think we'll leave the Varosians to work out their own idea of
justice, Peri. <br>
GOVERNOR: I'm very grateful, Doctor. Varos is grateful. Is there
nothing we can offer you in return? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, er, a little zeiton-7 would be quite useful, not to say
essential. <br>
GOVERNOR: You shall have as much as you need. Maldak will arrange it. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Goodbye. <br>
(The Doctor holds out his hand. The Governor catches on quickly.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Ah, goodbye. Goodbye. <br>

PERI: Goodbye. <br>
