<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A blazing object streaks through the atmosphere
and lands in the sea near a lighthouse. One of the keepers, a young
man, watches it through a telescope on the small gallery running round
the outside of the lantern room. Although it is night, the lantern is
not lit. All the men speak with 'yokel' accents, presumably meant to be
West Country.) <br>
VINCE: Ere, Reuben. Come and look, quick. <br>
REUBEN: What is it, boy? <br>
VINCE: This light, shot across the sky. Went under the sea, it did, and
the sea was all glowing. Over there. <br>
(Reuben looks through the telescope.) <br>
REUBEN: Nothing there now. <br>
VINCE: Not now, maybe. I told you, it went under the sea. <br>
REUBEN: It could have been a, what do they call them, meteor. <br>
VINCE: Mmm. Weren't far off. <br>
(The third keeper joins them.) <br>
BEN: Oh, sightseeing now, are we? Hoping to spot some of them bathing
belles on the beach, eh? <br>
REUBEN: Vince here's been seeing stars. <br>
VINCE: I saw a light. Clear across the sky it came and went under the
sea. <br>
BEN: Shooting star, eh? <br>
VINCE: Weren't no shooting star. I've seen them before. <br>
REUBEN: Bring you luck, boy, that will. Bit of luck coming for you. <br>
VINCE: On this rock? Not till my three month is up. <br>
(Reuben goes inside and gets the light working.) <br>
BEN: Well, whatever it was, it's gone now. So long as it isn't a hazard
to navigation we don't have to bother with it. <br>
VINCE: It were all red and glowing. <br>
BEN: Aye, well, I've heard enough about now, lad. I'm off downstairs
for my supper. You just forget it. <br>
(But something is approaching the lighthouse from the sea. We are
looking through a single round aperture surrounded by blue.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Crew room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> REUBEN: The old days were simple enough. You just
filled her up, trimmed the wick, and that old lamp just went burning
away steady as you like. <br>
BEN: It wasn't only the lamp that burned sometimes though, was it. What
about all those fires they had, eh? Towers gutted, men killed. <br>
(Ben and Reuben eat their meal.) <br>
REUBEN: Well, carelessness, that was. That or drink. Oil's safe enough
if you treat her right. <br>
BEN: Now listen, Reuben. I've seen the inside of some of them old
lighthouses <br>
REUBEN: I served twenty year in one. <br>
BEN: Like the inside of a chimney, they was. Grease and soot
everywhere, floor covered with oil and bits of wick. <br>
REUBEN: Never, mate. Never. <br>
BEN: And as for the light. Oh dear oh me. You couldn't see it from the
inside, never mind from the out. Great clouds of black smoke, soon as
they were lit. <br>
REUBEN: If your electricity's so good, why are they going back to oil?
You tell me that. <br>
BEN: Ah, now that's an oil vapour system. That's a different thing
altogether. They're going back to that as they reckon as how that's
cheaper, see. <br>
REUBEN: Course it's cheaper. <br>
(The speaking trumpet whistles. Reuben gets up to answer it.) <br>
REUBEN: Time they've paid out all that coal. Ahoy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lamp room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VINCE: That you, Reuben? (listens) King Edward,
eh? Well, your majesty, will you tell the principal keeper that there's
a fog coming up here like nobody's business. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Crew room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Reuben hangs up the brass and rubber tube
contraption back on the wall.) <br>
REUBEN: Vince says there's a fog coming up. <br>
BEN: Fog? There weren't no sign of that earlier. <br>
REUBEN: He reckons it's a thick 'un, Ben. <br>
BEN: I'd best go and see for myself. After all, the boy's only
learning. <br>
(The Tardis lands in swirling fog a short way from the lighthouse.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lamp gallery]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BEN: I never seen a fog come in like that afore.
And thick! <br>
REUBEN: Worst thing for sailors that ever was. <br>
BEN: Do you feel that cold too? <br>
REUBEN: Aye. <br>
BEN: That come from Iceland, I reckon. <br>
VINCE: It's come from where I saw that thing fall. <br>
BEN: Oh, get along with you, boy. It's about time you got that siren
started. <br>
REUBEN: He might be right, Ben. It do seem unnatural. <br>
BEN: Not you, too? And I want a blast every two minutes, and I don't
mean ten. <br>
(Vince ducks back inside the lantern room.) <br>
REUBEN: Another thing with oil, it gives a better light in fog. <br>
(The foghorn starts up.) <br>
BEN: Oh, rubbish. Electricity's just as good, and a darn sight more
reliable. <br>
(The light stops.) <br>
REUBEN: Reliable? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Leela are still in late Victorian
or Edwardian-style garb. Leela wears a sailor-style top, long skirt and
straw boater.) <br>
LEELA: You said I would like Brighton. Well, I do not. <br>
DOCTOR: Does this look like Brighton? <br>
LEELA: I do not know. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not even Hove. It could be Worthing. <br>
LEELA: The machine has failed again? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, not really, not failed. We're on the right planet, in the
right time, roughly in the right general direction, assuming this is
Worthing. <br>
LEELA: You cannot tell. <br>
DOCTOR: Because the localised condition of planetary atmospheric
condensation caused a malfunction in the visual orientation circuits.
Or to put it another way, we got lost in the fog. Never mind. Easy
enough to pop back in and try again. That's odd. <br>
LEELA: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: A lighthouse without a light. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lamp gallery]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The foghorn is still going as Ben checks the
generator in the basement of the lighthouse. It all seems to be
chugging away all right, and the light comes back on.) <br>
VINCE: Hey, good old Ben. Didn't take him long, did it. <br>
REUBEN: Working, not working, working again. You never know where you
are with it, do you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Crew room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ben enters.) <br>
VINCE: I just came down for my heavy jersey. It's freezing up there. <br>
BEN: It's worse in the generator room, even with the boiler. <br>
VINCE: Well, you repaired her, anyway. <br>
BEN: No. Lights came on by 'emselves. <br>
VINCE: What, for no reason? <br>
BEN: It's got me flummoxed. There's something going on here tonight,
something I don't understand. <br>
(Ben prepared to make an entry in the log book.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Fang rock]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LEELA: Look, the light is shining in that tower. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good. We'll just knock on the door, get directions and
we'll be on our way. <br>
LEELA: What is that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: Foghorn. <br>
LEELA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I said it's a foghorn! It warns the ships off these rocks.
Mightn't spot the light in this fog. You know what ships are. We saw
some on the Thames, remember? <br>
LEELA: I feel something wrong here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lamp room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Vince brings Reuben a woollen cap.) <br>
VINCE: Old Ben's worried. <br>
REUBEN: So he should be. His precious electricity. <br>
VINCE: Writing it all down in the log, he is. Says he can't understand
it. <br>
(And the light stops again.) <br>
REUBEN: Done it again, see? <br>
VINCE: He'll be spitting blood, won't he. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Generator room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ben goes back down to the generator room, where
the drive belt is going round quite happily. But there is something
else there, and it backs Ben up against the wall. Glass smashes.) <br>
BEN: Argh! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lamp room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Vince sounds the foghorn again.) <br>
VINCE: Over two minutes. <br>
REUBEN: Reckon it's not coming on this time. <br>
VINCE: Make no difference, not in this weather. Have their bows right
onto Fang Rock afore they see our old lamp. <br>
REUBEN: Aye, this is a queer 'un. No cause for it. <br>
VINCE: It's cold air and warm air mixing, that's the cause. <br>
REUBEN: I've been thirty years in the service, Vince. One look at the
sky and I know when fog's coming. Today was clear as clear. <br>
VINCE: Maybe I'd best go down and see if Ben needs a hand. <br>
REUBEN: You do that, boy. T'ain't natural. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Generator room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor opens the door and whistles.) <br>
DOCTOR: Keeper? <br>
(The Doctor and Leela enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: The generator's working. I wonder what's happening to the
power? <br>
LEELA: I'm not a teshnician. <br>
DOCTOR: It could be shorting out, I suppose. <br>
LEELA: And I suppose you are going to mend it? <br>
DOCTOR: What, without asking permission? I wouldn't dream of it. Let's
talk to the crew first. This way. Teshnician? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Staircase]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Anyone at home? <br>
VINCE: That you, Ben? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. <br>
VINCE: 'Ere, who are you, then? <br>
LEELA: I'm Leela. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. How do you do. You seem to be having some
trouble here. <br>
VINCE: How'd you get here? <br>
LEELA: We came in the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: We're mislaid mariners. Our craft's parked on the other side of
the island. <br>
VINCE: Oh. Oh, you got lost in the fog, did you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
VINCE: Oh, you'd best come up to the crew room. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
VINCE: Where was you heading for? <br>
DOCTOR: Worthing. <br>
LEELA: Brighton. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Crew room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VINCE: You did get lost, didn't you. I'll get you
some vittles soon as we're sorted out. You'll not want to go on in this
fog. Small craft, is she? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, small in some ways. <br>
LEELA: Yes, but big in others. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the trouble here? <br>
VINCE: The generator keeps playing up. Lights go off then they come on
again for no reason. <br>
DOCTOR: Tricky things, the early generators. <br>
VINCE: Oh, ours is the latest modern design, sir. Still, it's driving
Ben wild. <br>
DOCTOR: Ben? Who's Ben? <br>
VINCE: He's the engineer. <br>
DOCTOR: Just the two of you, are there? <br>
VINCE: Three, sir. Old Reuben's up in the lamp room. Killing himself,
he is. Fit to bust. <br>
LEELA: He's crippled? <br>
VINCE: No. Oh, I mean, no, he's one of the old-fashioned sort, you see.
Never been really happy since they took out the oil. Hates electricity.
<br>
(The Doctor is reading the log.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know the type. In the early days of oil, he'd have said
there's nothing like a really large candle, eh? <br>
VINCE: Aye, that's Reuben right enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Where's Ben now? <br>
VINCE: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Ben. Why isn't he working on the generator? <br>
VINCE: Well, he is, sir. You must have seen him. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, I didn't. <br>
VINCE: Oh, he must have stepped out for a moment and you missed him in
the fog. <br>
LEELA: If he had been there, I would have heard. <br>
VINCE: I'd better go and look for him. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's all right, that's all right. What's your name? <br>
VINCE: Vince, sir. Vince Hawkins. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll go, Mister Hawkins. I'm something of an engineer myself. I
might be able to help. You look after the young lady. <br>
VINCE: Right you are, sir. <br>
(Leela shuts the door after the Doctor. The foghorn sounds.) <br>
VINCE: This is quite a treat for me, miss. <br>
LEELA: Is it? <br>
VINCE: Oh, don't touch that, please, miss. Oh yes, it's a lonely up in
the lighthouse, you see. I go out sometimes and talk to the seals, you
know, just to get a change from Reuben and Ben. <br>
LEELA: Seals are animals? <br>
VINCE: Well, yes. <br>
LEELA: That is stupid. You should talk often with the old ones of the
tribe. That is the only way to learn. <br>
VINCE: I'll get you a hot drink, miss. <br>
LEELA: I could do with some dry clothes more than a hot drink. <br>
VINCE: Oh, I'm afraid we don't have nothing suitable for a lady. <br>
LEELA: I'm no lady, Vince. The clothes you are wearing will be most
suitable. <br>
(Leela removes her skirt and shakes out the underskirts.) <br>
VINCE: These are men's clothes, miss. Working clothes. <br>
(Vince turns round then averts his eyes.) <br>
VINCE: I'll, er, I'll find you something, miss. I'll go and find
something. <br>
(He leaves as she starts to unfasten her blouse.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Generator room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Ben? <br>
(He shouts outside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ben? Ben! No Ben. <br>
(The Doctor closes the door again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Curiouser and curiouser. <br>
(He goes to the far side of the generator.) <br>
VINCE: Well done, sir. You're an engineer and no mistake. Doctor, where
are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm over here. <br>
VINCE: Oh. Found the trouble, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I always find trouble. <br>
VINCE: Oh, Ben'll be pleased. <br>
DOCTOR: I doubt it. <br>
VINCE: Oh, he will, sir. He couldn't make head nor tail of what were
wrong. I wonder where he's got to. <br>
(Leela comes down the stairs dressed in trousers and jersey, with a
belt and her knife.) <br>
DOCTOR: He's over there, dead. He's been dead some little time. <br>
VINCE: What? Ben. Oh, no! <br>
LEELA: What killed him? <br>
DOCTOR: As far as I can tell, a massive electric shock. He died
instantly. <br>
VINCE: The generator? But he were always so careful. <br>
LEELA: It was very dark. <br>
VINCE: He had a lantern. Oh, I don't believe it. <br>
DOCTOR: Vince, you'd better go and tell old Reuben what's happened. Go
on. <br>
VINCE: Right, sir. <br>
(Vince goes up the stairs.) <br>
LEELA: You do not believe the machine killed him? Then what? <br>
(The Doctor ducks through an archway. There's the sound of metal on
stone then he comes out with a shovel.) <br>
DOCTOR: I thought there might have been something nasty in the coal
hole. There's something nasty somewhere. <br>
LEELA: A sea creature? <br>
DOCTOR: What, that can open and shut doors and doesn't so much as leave
a wet footprint, and has the ability to drain off electricity? <br>
(The Doctor picks up a mangled piece of molten metal slats.) <br>
LEELA: What is wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: That's Ben's lantern. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Reuben crosses himself.) <br>
REUBEN: Ben knew every blessed inch of that there machine. Don't make
sense, boy. <br>
VINCE: That's what this Doctor says. Electric shock. <br>
REUBEN: Foreign, is he? <br>
VINCE: I don't think so. Though tis true the young lady speaks a bit
strange. Why? <br>
REUBEN: Could be spies. <br>
VINCE: Spies! What would spies want on Fang Rock? <br>
REUBEN: There's the Frogs, the Russkies, Germans too. Can't trust none
of them. <br>
VINCE: Oh, they ain't spies. <br>
REUBEN: All this started just about the time they got here. Don't you
forget that. <br>
VINCE: You don't think, you ain't saying that they might have done for
Ben? <br>
REUBEN: I'm saying there's strange things afoot here tonight, and them
two could be at the bottom of it. Reckon I'll just go and take a look
at 'em. <br>
VINCE: 'Ere, Reuben. <br>
REUBEN: Aye? <br>
VINCE: You'll have to send a message to the shore station. We'll want a
relief boat to take Ben away. <br>
REUBEN: Aye, I'll see to it, boy, soon as it's light. Where is he? <br>
VINCE: Generator room. Oh, I know it don't sound respectful. <br>
REUBEN: That it don't. <br>
VINCE: It's only till the boat gets here. <br>
REUBEN: He won't rest easy, you know, boy. <br>
VINCE: Eh? <br>
REUBEN: If Ben was killed by that damn blasted machine, there'll be
anger in his soul. And when they die like that, they'll never rest
easy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Leela is tucking into a plate of the crew's
stew.) <br>
DOCTOR: This is very interesting, Leela. It's called a Marconi Wireless
Telegraph. You can send messages a long way with this. <br>
REUBEN: You leave that be, if you don't mind, mister. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. Shouldn't you be using it to report Ben's death? <br>
REUBEN: Wireless won't bring Ben back, will it. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
REUBEN: I'll use the semaphore in the morning. <br>
DOCTOR: You do know how to operate it? <br>
REUBEN: Course, we all does, but Ben <br>
DOCTOR: Was the expert. <br>
REUBEN: I'll use the semaphore tomorrow. Likely the police will be
wanting to see you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, very likely. <br>
REUBEN: Do you mind? <br>
LEELA: What is it for? <br>
REUBEN: Shroud. <br>
LEELA: What is that? <br>
REUBEN: In England we have proper customs. It ain't fitting for a body
just to be left. <br>
DOCTOR: Reuben, do you think we had something to do with your friend's
death? <br>
REUBEN: I know what I know, and I know what I think. <br>
DOCTOR: Incontrovertible. <br>
REUBEN: And don't start talking your own lingo to each other, either. I
won't have that. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you going to do, clap us in irons? <br>
REUBEN: I'm senior in this station now. <br>
DOCTOR: Reuben, we're only trying to help. <br>
REUBEN: Vince and me will manage, thank you, mister. I'll just go and
tend to Ben. <br>
(Reuben leaves with cloth, needle and thread.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stubborn old mule. <br>
LEELA: Doctor, do you think this creature, whatever it is, will return?
<br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
LEELA: Well, if it is out on the rocks, we must take weapons and hunt
it. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't fancy playing tag in the fog with something that can do
that. I think I'll go and have a word with Vince. <br>
(Leela takes a large knife and sneaks downstairs. Reuben is behind the
generator, tending to Ben's corpse, as she opens the door and goes
outside.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: A fireball? A fireball? <br>
VINCE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: What time was that? <br>
VINCE: A couple of hours ago, just getting dusk. It went into the sea,
over there. <br>
DOCTOR: How far away? <br>
VINCE: A mile or two, near as I could tell. Don't know how big it was,
you see. And then the fog came down and it got cold all of a sudden. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I noticed the cold. You're a good lad, Vince. <br>
VINCE: Thank you, sir. <br>
(Out on the rocks, Leela picks her way carefully to the shore, where
she finds dead fish floating in the water. Then there is a crackling
sound near by, like electricity.) <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, on Pharos they had slaves to keep the bonfires
going. <br>
VINCE: I suppose it's all different abroad. Didn't know they still had
slaves, though. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, and I'll tell you something else now. On Gallifrey <br>
(Reuben enters.) <br>
VINCE: Gallifrey? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Galli. <br>
REUBEN: I'll take over here, boy. Time you got some supper. <br>
VINCE: Oh, I'm all right. <br>
REUBEN: Long night ahead of us. Expect you'll be tired, mister. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, not a bit of it. Don't mind me. <br>

LEELA: This alien must have great power to change its shape at will. <br>
DOCTOR: It has. But it needed to study the human life pattern first. <br>
LEELA: That is why it took the engineer. <br>
DOCTOR: Organic restructuring is elementary physiology for Time Lords. <br>
LEELA: Then there is nothing we can do. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: Well, if this creature is a Time Lord <br>
DOCTOR: No, not a Time Lord. Elementary physiology for us is something
that lesser species might master after a few thousand centuries. <br>
LEELA: Oh. Then we have nothing to worry about. <br>
DOCTOR: We don't? <br>
LEELA: No. You will easily dispose of this primitive creature, Doctor.
You are a Time Lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but it took Reuben's form for a reason. <br>
LEELA: To kill us stealthily, one by one. Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
LEELA: Suppose we pretend that we still think Reuben is Reuben, and not
the alien, then we can get close enough to it and kill it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. We can't. If we got within touching distance of
it, we're dead. It packs too many volts. <br>
LEELA: What is it? <br>
(The Doctor finds a metal cylinder by the base of the generator.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's some kind of power relay. <br>
LEELA: Does it belong to the alien? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Rule one after surviving a crash landing, set up
distress beacon. To do that it would have needed a power source. That's
why it came here. There must be a signal modulator somewhere,
transmitting. To whom? To it's own kind. Leela, get the surviving
humans to the lamp room. <br>
LEELA: To the lamp room. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the easiest place to defend. <br>
LEELA: Oh, but Doctor, where shall we look for this mognal sigulator? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll do the looking. Hurry, there isn't much time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Skinsale is pacing, slowly.) <br>
ADELAIDE: Do keep still! It's like some terrible dream. <br>
SKINSALE: Pity it's not a dream. We'd stand a chance of waking up. <br>
(Leela enters.) <br>
SKINSALE: Is Harker dead? <br>
LEELA: Yes. Like the others. The creature has got into the lighthouse.
Now we must fight for our lives. <br>
(Adelaide faints. Leela rolls her eyes. <br>
(In the bunk room, the Doctor is searching pockets when he hears slow,
heavy footsteps. He hides in a bunk, pulling the curtain across. It is
'Reuben.' He enters and draws the curtain. The Doctor is hanging by his
fingertips from the window ledge outside.) <br>
SKINSALE: Come on, Adelaide, drink this. Come on, drink it. <br>
LEELA: Hurry. The Doctor wants us to go to the lamp room. <br>
SKINSALE: Why the lamp room? <br>
LEELA: It is the easiest place to defend ourselves. <br>
SKINSALE: Right. Come on, Adelaide. <br>
ADELAIDE: No. <br>
SKINSALE: Come on. <br>
ADELAIDE: No. <br>
SKINSALE: Come along. <br>
LEELA: Back! Back! Get back! <br>
('Reuben' enters, with that sick grin. The Doctor climbs back into the
bunk room, first removing a small metal antenna from outside the
window. <br>
Adelaide screams, and gets electrocuted by 'Reuben' in the same way we
saw him kill Vince.) <br>
LEELA: Run! Run! <br>
(Skinsale runs for the door as Leela throws a knife at 'Reuben'. He
pulses green and it goes straight through.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Staircase]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SKINSALE: Adelaide, Doctor. It's got Adelaide. <br>
DOCTOR: Where's Leela? <br>
LEELA: Doctor, the creature! Behind us. We must find weapons. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Now listen. When you reach the service room, you'll find
a locker full of maroons. I want you to break them open and scatter the
powder down the lamp room stairs. Vince'll help you. Off you go. <br>
SKINSALE: Right. <br>
LEELA: It's coming. <br>
(The service room is always directly below the lamp or lantern room in
a lighthouse. Skinsale and Leela run up the stairs. The Doctor sits on
the stairs.) <br>
DOCTOR: May I help you? Having trouble, Reuben, hmm? Not easy holding a
human form stable, is it. <br>
REUBEN: No longer necessary. We can abandon this ridiculous shape. <br>
DOCTOR: Good idea. You'll find it a lot comfier. <br>
(Reuben transforms into the glowing green ball.) </font></p>

SKINSALE: Just like the others. <br>
LEELA: Then there is nothing we can do. The maroons. <br>
SKINSALE: This terrible thing will destroy us all. Poor chap. <br>
LEELA: You must forget him now. <br>
(Leela takes the maroons from their tin box.) <br>
LEELA: It is time for us to fight. <br>
(They start to prise them open when they hear a crackling sound.) <br>
LEELA: Listen. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Now I remember. Reuben the Rutan. <br>
RUTAN: You know our form? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, when you've seen one Rutan, you've seen them all. <br>
RUTAN: We are a Rutan scout. We are specially trained in the new
metamorphosis techniques. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I expect you'll get better at it in time. What are you
doing in this part of the galaxy anyway? <br>
RUTAN: That doesn't concern you. You are to be destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: Got it! You're at last losing that interminable war with the
Sontarans. <br>
RUTAN: That is a lie! <br>
DOCTOR: Is it? You used to control the whole of the Mutter's Spiral
once. Now the Sontarans have driven you to the far fringes of the
galaxy. <br>
RUTAN: The glorious Rutan army is making a series of strategic
withdrawals to selected strong points. <br>
DOCTOR: Rutan, that's the empty rhetoric of a defeated dictator, and I
don't like your face, either. <br>
RUTAN: Your mockery will end with your race, Earthling, when the mighty
Rutan battle fleet occupies this planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Why invade an obscure planet like Earth? It's of no value to
you. <br>
RUTAN: The planet is obscure, but its strategic position is sound. We
shall use it as a launch point for our final assault on the Sontaran
rabble. <br>
DOCTOR: But if you set up a power base here, the Sontarans will bombard
it with photonic missiles. <br>
RUTAN: That is unimportant. It will serve the cause of our final
glorious victory. <br>
DOCTOR: And what about its people? <br>
RUTAN: Primitive bipeds of no value. We scouted all the planets of this
solar system. Only this one suits our purpose. <br>
DOCTOR: I can understand your military purposes, but why murder a
hatful of harmless humans? <br>
RUTAN: It is necessary. Til we return to our mother ship, and the
mother ship informs the fleet, no one must know of our visit to Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: But you crashed, didn't you, just as you made your discovery.
You failed. <br>
RUTAN: Failed? We are sending a signal to the mother ship with the
power from the primitive mechanism below. <br>
(The Doctor holds up the antenna.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're not, you know. <br>
RUTAN: It's of no importance. The ship will home in on the primary
signal. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to disappoint you. I fixed that as well, oyster face.
<br>
RUTAN: All your interference is useless. The beam was transmitting long
enough for the mother ship to trace the signal. <br>
DOCTOR: You can't be certain. <br>
RUTAN: It will come. <br>
DOCTOR: But by then, you'll be dead. <br>
RUTAN: What could you Earthlings possibly do to us? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you'll just step this way, I'll show you. <br>
(The Doctor runs up the stairs. The Rutan lumbers up behind. Round is
not a good shape for climbing stairs.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LEELA: Here he comes! <br>
DOCTOR: I've brought someone to see you. Give me one of those fuses,
quickly. <br>
SKINSALE: Is this advisable, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Probably not, but we've no choice. I'm so sorry to bother you.
Could you oblige me with a light? <br>
SKINSALE: A what? <br>
DOCTOR: A match. <br>
SKINSALE: Oh yes, of course, here. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Move over. <br>
(They all gather at the top of the stairs.) <br>
LEELA: How did you hold it back on the stairs? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, a little militant chit-chat. <br>
(The Doctor strikes the match on the stonework and lights the fuse. The
Rutan hoves into view around the corner.) <br>
DOCTOR: What kept you? <br>
RUTAN: The time for talk is over. <br>
DOCTOR: Correct. <br>
(The Doctor throws the lit fuse down onto the gunpowder on the stairs.
There is a massive flash! and the Rutan screams.) <br>
LEELA: Where is it? Have you killed the thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Unlikely. <br>
SKINSALE: That's the most horrible thing I've ever seen. What the devil
is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's an intelligent, highly aggressive species from Ruta Three.
<br>
LEELA: Was it a sea creature? <br>
DOCTOR: It evolved in the sea, adapted to land. Any more gunpowder,
Colonel? <br>
(They go back to the box. There are still four flares.) <br>
LEELA: We are lucky that it fears flame. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Ruta Three is an icy planet. Its inhabitants find heat
intensely painful. Now, if we had a flame-thrower. <br>
SKINSALE: Well, there is this, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
SKINSALE: I carried it up from the service room. It looks like a kind
of mortar. <br>
DOCTOR: It's an early Schermuly. <br>
SKINSALE: An early Schermuly? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, an early Schermuly. A Schermuly box that fires a rocket
and line. <br>
SKINSALE: A projectile weapon. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It won't do, though. Stay calm, Skinsale. <br>
(The Doctor fetches a metal tripod with a cylinder on it from the
gallery.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here, take this. <br>
SKINSALE: Right, got it. <br>
DOCTOR: Loaded with a few odds and ends it should cover the stairs.
Empty your pockets, and mine. <br>
(They pour coins and knick-knacks into the cylinder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, it's not just this Rutan I'm worried about, it's the
others. <br>
SKINSALE: Others? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SKINSALE: You mean to say there are more of these beasts? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a whole battle fleet out there. By the time the Rutans
and the Sontarans <br>
SKINSALE: Sontarans? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. By the time they've finished with it, this planet'll be
like a cinder hanging in space. <br>
SKINSALE: You mean to say that there's a whole battle fleet coming
here? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Unless, of course, we could knock out both the mother ship
and the scout ship. If we could do that, they just might conclude that
this section of space was too dangerous. <br>
LEELA: How can we do that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. We've nothing here that would stop a Rutan
spaceship in its tracks. Rutan ships have a crystalline infrastructure,
you see. Shielded, of course. Still, landing on a planet like this,
they might just cut off the energy fields to save power. No, I'd need
an amplified carbon oscillator. <br>
LEELA: What is an am, what did you say? <br>
DOCTOR: It's like a laser beam but much more destructive. <br>
SKINSALE: A laser beam? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: Yes, that's some kind of very powerful light, isn't it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, yes, put in it's simplest terms. <br>
LEELA: Why don't we use this? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: This. <br>
(The lamp.) <br>
DOCTOR: That? Are you suggesting I convert the carbon arc beam? <br>
LEELA: Well, obviously. <br>
DOCTOR: Leela, that's a beautiful notion. Unfortunately I'd need a
focusing device, a fairly large piece of crystalline carbon. <br>
LEELA: Crystallised carbon? <br>
SKINSALE: A diamond. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(Skinsale unfastens his cufflinks.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's too small. I'd need a much bigger one for the
primary beam oscillator. <br>
SKINSALE: Palmerdale. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
SKINSALE: Palmerdale. He always carried diamonds. <br>
DOCTOR: He did? <br>
SKINSALE: He called them his insurance. <br>
DOCTOR: The crew room. <br>
SKINSALE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes. Well, let's get this working first. <br>
(They take their little home-made cannon to the top of the stairs. The
Rutan is making its way back up.) </font></p>

SKINSALE: Doctor, I'm coming with you. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not necessary. <br>
SKINSALE: I want to. You'll need someone. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. Remember, Leela, don't fire until you see the green
of its tentacles. <br>
LEELA: Doctor, how are you going to get past the Rutan? <br>

Palmerdale's pockets.) <br>

Skinsale is having no luck.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Body belt. Body belt! <br>
(Sure enough, underneath the shirt is a pouch tied around his waist.
Skinsale removes a black velvet purse and takes it out to the Doctor.
The Doctor shakes his hand, selects one diamond then throws the rest on
the stairs before heading back up. Skinsale stoops to pick them up
again just as the Rutan gets there. It throws a tentacle around the
man's neck, and he screams. The Doctor pauses, then runs upwards.) </font></p>

Bang, flash, Argh! from the Rutan.) <br>

LEELA: It is fitting to celebrate the death of an enemy. <br>
DOCTOR: Not in my opinion. I haven't got time to discuss morality. Look
out there. <br>
(Another red ball blazes across the sky then hovers over the sea.) <br>
LEELA: Is that the Rutan mother ship? <br>
DOCTOR: It is. When it gets within range, this will lock onto its
carbon resonator and knock out its anti-grav, I hope. We've got about a
hundred and seventeen seconds to get out of here. Understand? <br>

back! Let's go. Now! <br>
