<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A space ship descends vertically onto a pad. Two
aliens in silver clothes meet on a walkway. They have silver-grey skin,
and hair which runs round the back of the head and almost meets their
bushy eyebrows, leaving the top of the head bald. ) <br>
KALIK: Well, the cargo shuttle has arrived at last. <br>
ORUM: One must prepare oneself to encounter the aliens. <br>
KALIK: Reluctantly, one agrees. <br>
(Down below, boxes are being disgorged from a baggage area and falling
onto the floor. A different type of alien with a very grey skin and no
hair at all gestures and drags others of his kind to get the boxes onto
a nearby conveyor belt. Then two people in space suits fall out of the
hatch. One is a man with curly hair and spectacles, the other a woman
with bright earrings.) <br>
VORG: Oh, phew. Oh dear. <br>
SHIRNA: Top of the bill, he says. Received like Princes, he says. <br>
VORG: Now, now, Shirna, don't be so. The scope! Come on. Come on, give
me a hand. <br>
(Shirna helps him with a large cylinder with a half-globe on the top.) <br>
VORG: Careful now. Please be careful. <br>
(Two of the baggage handlers push it away from the hatch.) <br>
VORG: Now have a care with that, please? It cost a lot of credit bars. <br>
(Vorg picks up his single large bag while Shirna collects lots of
smaller red and blue ones.) <br>
SHIRNA: Look out, here they come. <br>
(Kalik and Orum enter. One of the baggage handlers grabs his head and
runs out and up to an upper walkway.) <br>
ORUM: No, no, no. Back! Back! Back! <br>
(Orum holds back the other baggage handlers while Kalik takes an
elegant device like a two pronged fork with a bar joining the tips of
the
prongs, and a red light bulb in the handle. He fires, and the handler
falls from the walkway to the floor.) <br>
ORUM: Very good. You have eradicated him. <br>
KALIK: No, no, no. Merely rendered him unconscious. <br>
ORUM: But he will be disposed of? <br>
KALIK: Naturally. But first his mental and nervous systems will be
subjected to analysis. <br>
ORUM: Yes, of course. Now, one must deal with the aliens.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises in the hold of a
sea-going vessel which is neither alien nor modern.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, I tell you there's no need for a test, Jo. I've been here
before and the air is perfectly <br>
JO: Poo, it smells. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's odd. <br>
JO: Sort of farmy. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, gaseous sulphides, low concentration. Nothing to
worry about.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Shirna takes off her spacesuit to reveal her
showgirl's outfit - a multicoloured low-cut halterneck cat suit with
lots of bobbles on it. The baggage handlers gather. Vorg is also
brightly dressed. His sequined coat has very large coloured plastic
circles on the lapels.) <br>
SHIRNA: Hey, Vorg. <br>
VORG: Well, well, well. We're getting a crowd. Better start the pitch. <br>
SHIRNA: Here? <br>
VORG: There's no point in wasting any time. Roll up, roll up and see
the monster show! <br>
(Vorg puts on a transparent bowler hat. Shirna taps an alien
tambourine.) <br>
VORG: Roll up and see the monster show! A carnival of monsters, all
living in their natural habitat, wild in this little box of mine. A
miracle of intragalactic technology! Roll up! Roll up! Roll <br>
(Kalik and Orum enter, and the baggage handlers shuffle away quickly.) <br>
KALIK: So those are Lurmans. <br>
ORUM: The male is called Vorg, it seems. The female, Shirna. <br>
KALIK: Ridiculous names. At least their physiology is familiar. One was
afraid they might have four heads. <br>
ORUM: No doubt that is why President Zarb decreed that Lurmans should
be our first alien visitors. <br>
KALIK: No good can come from fraternising with these inferior races. <br>
ORUM: Nevertheless, Commissioner Kalik, one has one's duty to perform,
no matter how unpleasant. <br>
KALIK: Hmm. One thinks one will wait for Plectrac. He is chairman of
this tribunal. Let him do his duty. <br>
(A red light flashes on the Scope.) <br>
SHIRNA: Vorg, look. <br>
VORG: Huh? Oh, that's nothing. <br>
(He tries hitting the Scope.) <br>
VORG: I'm sure it's nothing. <br>
SHIRNA: It indicates a systems defect, doesn't it? <br>
VORG: It's just a loose connection somewhere. Nothing of any
importance. <br>
SHIRNA: A systems defect. <br>
VORG: Of all the times to go wrong!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Well, I can assure you that the last time
I was here, the air was like wine. <br>
JO: Are you certain we are here? <br>
DOCTOR: Where? <br>
JO: Well, where you think we are. Are you sure you can steer that
Tardis properly? <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, I don't steer the Tardis, I programme it, and according to
programme, this is Metebelis Three, the famous blue planet of the
Acteon group. <br>
JO: Shush. Listen! <br>
(The ship's engine's are rumbling.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's extraordinary. We appear to be in some kind of a
machine. <br>
JO: Yes, and it's moving. I can feel it. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. Come on. <br>
JO: Where are you going? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, to find out where we are, of course. <br>
JO: I thought you knew? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we may have slightly overshot the blue planet, but
we must be on one of planets in the group. We'll soon see. <br>
(Something else makes a noise in the hold.) <br>
JO: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
JO: There's something alive over there. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's take a look, shall we? <br>
(They go over to a crate.) <br>
JO: Chickens! <br>
DOCTOR: Greetings! <br>
DOCTOR: All right, all right, all right, all right. We're friends. <br>
JO: Try clucking. <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, when you've travelled as much as I have, you'll learn never
to judge by appearances. These creatures may look like chickens, but
for all we know, they're the intelligent life form on this planet. <br>
JO: They not only look like chickens, they are chickens. And what about
this? <br>
(The box underneath the chickens has a place name stenciled across it.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Singapore. <br>
JO: The Acteon galaxy, you said, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Jo, do come on. <br>
JO: Bye. <br>
(Outside the hold door is a ladder to the main deck.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Main deck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A sailor walks past the doors to the lower decks.
The Doctor and Jo open one slightly and watch him walk away.) <br>
JO: Hey <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
JO: It's just an ordinary ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Appearances can be very deceiving, Jo. There's something wrong
here. <br>
JO: We're still on Earth, aren't we. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's impossible. <br>
JO: Don't you ever admit that you're wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: No. That's impossible too. Come on, but keep low. <br>
(They creep past the main cargo hatches, then hide as an Indian cook
pours a bucket of slops over the side.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. <br>
(They go up a ladder to the rear superstructure where any passengers
and crew would live.) <br>
DALY [OC]: Splendid dinner. Absolutely topping. <br>
(The Doctor and Jo duck into an open cabin as a man in a white suit
walks along the gangway with a young woman in 1920s dress, followed by
an officer in tropical whites.) <br>
DALY: There's nothing like a good curry.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Saloon cabin]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Jo hide behind a large settee as
the dinner party enter.) <br>
DALY: You say the cook's a Madrasi, Andrews? <br>
ANDREWS: I believe so, sir. <br>
(Everyone say Hi to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0551722/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Ian
Marter</a>.) <br>
DALY: Oh. I find the Madrasis a bit idle myself. Won't have them on the
plantation. Still, I must admit your fellow does know how to curry a
chicken. Sundowner? <br>
(Daly pours a drink.) <br>
ANDREWS: Not for me, sir. <br>
DALY: Claire? <br>
CLAIRE: No thank you, Daddy. John and I thought we'd take a turn around
the deck. <br>
ANDREWS: Would you care to join us, sir? It's a glorious evening. <br>
DALY: No, no, no, no. You two run along. I'm going to do a spot of
reading. Determined to finish this book before we reach Bombay. <br>
CLAIRE: Well, we're due there tomorrow. How much have you got left? <br>
DALY: Only another two chapters. <br>
ANDREWS: Well, we'll see you later then, sir. <br>
DALY: Yes. <br>
ANDREWS: Twenty times round the deck is a mile, Claire. So, if we put
our best feet forward <br>
(Andrews and Claire leave. Daly settles with his book but soon yawns
and falls asleep.) <br>
CLAIRE [OC]: I love musical plays. I saw Lady Be Good four times. Don't
you think that young American chap was marvellous? You know, Fred
somebody. Fred Astaire. <br>
ANDREWS [OC]: Personally, I think musicals are a lot of nonsense. <br>
(The couple carry on with their next circuit of the deck. There is the
faint sound of jazz music from somewhere. The Doctor and Jo come out of
hiding.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) No, there's only one explanation. <br>
JO: (sotto) What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) This isn't Earth. It just looks like it. <br>
JO: (sotto) All right, Doctor, I'll convince you. <br>
DALY: (mumble) chota peg (mumble) <br>
(Jo takes a magazine from the table.) <br>
JO: (sotto) There. Take a look at that. <br>
(It is The Illustrated London News of Saturday, April 3, 1926.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) 1926? <br>
JO: (sotto) Convinced? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) No. <br>
JO: (sotto) Oh, Doctor, you're so stubborn. And you ought to have an L
plate for that police box of yours. You don't even know where you're
going in it. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Come on, Jo. <br>
JO: (sotto) Where to? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Back to the Tardis. <br>
JO: (sotto) What for? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Well, I don't know what's happening here, but I don't
like it. Why do you want to stay? <br>
JO: (sotto) I just want you to admit the truth, that's all. Well,
instead of swanning around some distant galaxy, we've slipped back
about forty years in time and we're on a little cargo boat in the
middle of the Indian Ocean. <br>
(Roar outside. Claire screams. Jo and the Doctor duck back into
hiding.) <br>
DALY: What? What? What? What? What? <br>
(Claire and Andrews rush in.) <br>
CLAIRE: Daddy, there's something terrible out there in the sea! <br>
DALY: What's going on? <br>
ANDREWS: Some kind of monster! <br>
(Through the open doorway we see a large head with equally large teeth
rear up level with it. The crew sound as if they are panicking.) <br>
DALY: What the deuce is it? <br>
DOCTOR: That's a plesiosaurus! <br>
JO: What? <br>
DOCTOR: It's incredible! If this really is 1926, the plesiosaurus has
been extinct for a hundred and thirty million years! <br>
(With a final roar, the dinosaur goes back under the waves.) <br>
DALY: It's gone back in the sea. <br>
ANDREWS: I'd better get a rifle, Major. It might attack again. Here,
sir, if you'll just look after Claire a moment. <br>
DALY: Yes, yes, yes, of course. I say, what a monstrous beast. <br>
CLAIRE: It was awful, horrible! <br>
DALY: There, there, there, my child. You'd better come and sit down.
I've never seen anything like it in me life. I wonder if it'll come
back? <br>
CLAIRE: Oh, no! <br>
DALY: Hmm? Oh, you look as if you need a peg. Might get a shot at the
beast next time. <br>
(Daly goes to the drinks tray. The Doctor sees that their coast is
clear.) <br>
DOCTOR: (silent) Come on. <br>
DALY: What a head, eh? Gad, I'd love to have that on the club wall,
what? <br>
(Claire spots the Doctor and Jo, and squeals.) <br>
DALY: Hello? <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. Topping day, what? <br>
DALY: Just a minute. You two passengers? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, yes, but only temporarily. <br>
DALY: What? <br>
JO: Oh, he means only to Bombay. <br>
DALY: But I thought my daughter and I were the only passengers. <br>
CLAIRE: Where did you come aboard? <br>
JO: Port Said. <br>
CLAIRE: I don't understand. Why haven't we met before? <br>
JO: Ah, well you see, my uncle hasn't been terribly well, so <br>
DALY: Ah, poor traveller, eh? Not used to it, I suppose. <br>
DOCTOR: On that contrary, sir, I <br>
DALY: Well, never mind. We've now got a four for bridge, what? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
DALY: Or would you prefer Mah Jong? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(Andrews enters.) <br>
ANDREWS: Not a sign of the beast, Major. Who are these people? <br>
DALY: Well, don't you know, Andrews? <br>
CLAIRE: They said they joined the ship at Port Said. <br>
ANDREWS: Stowaways, eh? <br>
DALY: Stowaways! <br>
ANDREWS: Where have you been hiding? <br>
JO: You tell them, uncle.

one in a floor length coat.) <br>
PLETRAC: Another functionary has dared to ascend to the higher level. <br>
KALIK: One witnessed the event. <br>
ORUM: One cannot understand why they do it. <br>
KALIK: But then one is not a functionary. <br>
PLETRAC: It is a growing problem. As members of the official species,
we must all share President Zarb's concern. <br>

this thing like civilised people, what? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's an excellent idea, Major. I'll have a large scotch.
<br>
ANDREWS: Major Daly, these people are stowaways, quite possibly even
criminals, and either unable or unwilling to give a satisfactory
account of themselves. <br>
DALY: Hang it all, Andrews. The fellow is a sahib, you know. <br>
ANDREWS: This is not a social occasion, Major. <br>

ANDREWS: Thank you, sir. In that case, you two follow me. (to a sailor)
You bring up the rear. <br>

DOCTOR: Any more of these about on the ship, or is this the only one? <br>
ANDREWS: What? <br>
DOCTOR: These. Is this the only one? <br>

to the floor and easy to trip over. <br>

ANDREWS: I have a crew of Lascars who try to make a fool of me on every
trip. They've never managed it yet, and neither will you. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't underestimate us, sir. <br>
(There is a plan of the ship in a frame on the wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, is this ship the SS Bernice? <br>
ANDREWS: You trying to pretend you didn't even know that? <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't, but I do now. It makes everything much clearer. Thank
you. <br>
ANDREWS: All right. Now I'm going to lock you in here until the Captain
is ready to see you, and that might not be for a long time. He's a busy
man. <br>
(Andrews leaves.) <br>
JO: All right, Doctor. What's clear? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
JO: You said everything seemed much clearer now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, relatively speaking. An extinct monster, that plate out
there on the deck. Yes, this is all most interesting. <br>
JO: Do you really believe Andrews couldn't see it? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
JO: Well, the plate in the floor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it's been blocked from his consciousness. Yes. If I'm
right, it would have to be. It's certainly no part of the fabric of
this ship. <br>
JO: I'd say it was very much a part of the ship. A great lump of <br>
DOCTOR: A great lump of what? It's not steel, copper or iron. That
metal is unknown on Earth, Jo. <br>
JO: But we are on Earth. We must be. I mean, this ship, the people, the
chickens. Oh, come on, Doctor, you're not going to tell me that Major
Daly is an alien from another planet, are you? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
JO: Well then? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, look. Daly's been keeping track of the date. <br>
(Everything up to Tuesday 4th June are crossed off.) <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose the name of this ship means nothing to you, Jo? <br>
JO: No. Should it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, in its time, the SS Bernice was as famous a sea mystery
as the Marie Celeste. <br>
JO: Why? What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Nobody really knows. A freak tidal wave was the popular
explanation, although the Indian Ocean was as flat as a millpond on
that night. <br>
JO: You mean she sank? <br>
DOCTOR: No, she vanished, Jo. Two days out from Bombay on June the 4th,
1926, the SS Bernice just disappeared off the face of the Earth. <br>
JO: Disappeared on June the, June the 4th? But according to that
calendar, that's today. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, intriguing, isn't it? <br>
JO: Shall I tell you something else intriguing? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. <br>
JO: When we came in here, that clock said twenty five to eight. <br>
DOCTOR: Well? <br>
JO: Well, now look at it. <br>
(The clock says twenty to seven.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you've noticed that, have you? Well done. Shall I tell you
something that you may not have noticed? It's broad daylight outside. <br>
JO: So? <br>
DOCTOR: If this really is after dinner, and we are in the Indian Ocean,
it should be pitch dark. <br>
JO: I don't get it. <br>

JO: Sonic screwdriver? <br>
DOCTOR: No, that only works on electronic locks, Jo. We need something
far more primitive. <br>

SHIRNA: We put on a show. You understand? <br>

PLETRAC: No. <br>

nothing political. <br>
(The three locals move away to confer.) <br>
KALIK: Amusement is prohibited. It's purposeless. <br>
PLETRAC: Zarb is considering lifting that restriction. The latest
thinking is that the latest outbreak of violence among the
functionaries is caused through lack of amusement. <br>
KALIK: Oh, more anti-productive legislation. <br>
ORUM: Where will it end? <br>
KALIK: One can see where it will end, Orum. Ultimately, the
functionaries will take over. <br>
ORUM: Take over? <br>
PLETRAC: It is not the functionaries who dream of power, Kalik. <br>
KALIK: Huh? One simply speaks one's thoughts. <br>
PLETRAC: Your thoughts are as clear as your ambitions. <br>
KALIK: How dare <br>
ORUM: Please! One is simply here to decide whether to grant these
Lurmans an entrance visa. <br>
KALIK: Since their presence here is clearly subversive, one moves that
their application be rejected. <br>
PLETRAC: Opposed. <br>
ORUM: Supported. <br>

it. <br>

here. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) In a minute, Jo. If my theory's right, we should be
getting confirmation any minute now. <br>
JO: (sotto) Theory? What theory? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) About what's happening to this ship. <br>
JO: (sotto) What is happening? I mean, it's like a gramophone record. A
stuck gramophone record. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, well, naturally. You see, they've all been
programmed to repeat a simple behaviour pattern. <br>
JO: (sotto) And that monster, the plesiosaurus, that was programmed
too? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Very probably. <br>
JO: (sotto) But that was from a different time. They weren't any
plesiosaurus's in 1926. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, exactly. Historically speaking, this collection is
a bit of a jumble, I must admit. <br>
JO: (sotto) Do you mean that this ship is part of a collection? But it
all seems so ordinary. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Jo, have you ever seen any small boys collecting sea
creatures and putting them into a rock pool? <br>
JO: Hmm. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) And then after a minute all the sea creatures settle
down and behave quite normally, quite naturally. It's only the small
boys looking down from above that see the change in the environment. <br>
JO: (sotto) Oh, yes, but that's different. Human beings are slightly
more intelligent than whelks. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, and they were collected by a slightly more
sophisticated means than a bucket of water. But everything is relative,
Jo. <br>
JO: I'm sorry, Doctor, I just can't take it in. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't worry about it. Right, stand by for blasting. <br>
JO: Wait a minute, do you mean <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Right. Go and hide. (They duck down behind the settee.
The Doctor checks the exact time that the monster roars, Claire screams
and Daly wakes up.) <br>

CLAIRE: Oh, Daddy, there's something dreadful out there! <br>
DALY: What's going on? <br>
ANDREWS: Some kind of monster, sir! <br>
(The plesiosaurus appears.) <br>
DALY: What the deuce is it? <br>
(The plesiosaurus returns to the deep.) <br>
DALY: It's gone back in the sea! <br>
ANDREWS: I'd better get a rifle, Major. It might attack again. Here,
Major, if you'll just look after Claire a moment? <br>
DALY: Oh. Yes, yes, of course. I say, what a monstrous beast! <br>
CLAIRE: Yes, it was awful, horrible! <br>
DALY: There, there, there, child. You'd better come and sit down. I've
never seen anything like it in me life! I wonder if it'll come back? <br>

beast next time. <br>

VORG: Your worship, allow me to demonstrate. If you will watch the

(Claire and Andrews appear on the round screen.) <br>
ORUM: What is this? <br>
VORG: These creatures are Tellurians, a species discovered in a distant
galaxy. Scientists have been amazed at the remarkable similarity
between these little chaps and our own dominant lifeform. <br>
ORUM: The resemblance is unpleasant. <br>
VORG: These are the only Tellurians in captivity. Some scientists think
that their discovery refutes Valdek's theory that life in the universe
is infinitely variable. An even more interesting though less amusing
form of life is the Ogron. <br>
(The picture changes.) <br>
VORG: They are of limited intelligence and are used as servants by some
race called, er, Daleks, I believe. We will shortly be seeing the prize
of my collection. The Drashigs! <br>

VORG: They are, without doubt, the most evil, the most vicious and
undoubtedly the most frightening form of life in the whole of the

(Something with lots of eyes on stalks sinks into a mist.) <br>
KALIK: Amazing. <br>
VORG: The Drashigs have no intelligence centre, unfortunately, so I
cannot control their behaviour. <br>
ORUM: But these pictures, they are recorded, surely? <br>
VORG: Oh no, your worship. The Scope is good, old-fashioned live
entertainment. The picture on the glo-sphere is an actual projection of
what is now taking place deep down inside. <br>

Tellurian science is more advanced. <br>
KALIK: And if they can get into the machine, no doubt they can also get
out of it. <br>

permanently contained in its own individual chamber. The scope is

enough pursuit in itself, sir, but the collection of civilised
intelligent beings is a positive crime. Now let me warn you that I

(The functionaries shuffle off.) <br>
ORUM: The transporter must arrive shortly. <br>
KALIK: So, do you think my plan has failed? <br>
ORUM: Upon reflection, one is conscious of certain flaws. <br>
KALIK: Indeed? <br>
ORUM: One gathers the intention is the escape of these Drashigs in
order to cause a disaster that will reflect badly upon President Zarb
and his regime. <br>
KALIK: Admirably put. <br>
ORUM: To this end, one has sabotaged the eradicator in order to leave
the city defenceless. <br>
KALIK: Precisely. The bigger the disaster, the better for us. <br>
ORUM: Yes, but is it not possible that one might oneself become part of
that disaster? <br>
KALIK: There is a certain minimal risk. <br>
ORUM: One has no wish to be devoured by alien monstrosities, even in
the cause of political progress. <br>
KALIK: When the Drashigs burst from the machine, the city will be taken
by surprise. We, on the other hand, will be ready to remove ourselves
from the area of danger. <br>
ORUM: One trusts the removal will be speedy. According to that Lurman,
the ferocity of the Drashigs is formidable! <br>
KALIK: No doubt he exaggerates. And in any case, I'm sure that as
commissioners of Inter Minor we shall prove to be more than a match for
these, er, primitive lifeforms. Have no fear, Orum. My plan will not
fail. <br>
ORUM: Well, it will if the Drashigs don't escape.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ORUM: And there's no sign of that. <br>
KALIK: Shush. <br>
(They go over to the Scope and kneel down where the Drashigs are
battering against a panel.) <br>
KALIK: Isn't there? <br>
ORUM: (sotto) They'll never break through those plates. They're
molectic bonded disillum. <br>
KALIK: (sotto) Then perhaps one had better give them a little help. <br>
(As Jo leaves Daly's cabin, the Doctor has brought a tangle of
equipment and cables out of the Tardis and attached them to the Scope.)
<br>
VORG: Will it work, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course it'll work. <br>
VORG: Well, it's not very well insulated. <br>
DOCTOR: Then don't touch any bare metal. Right, now listen to me. This
is the phase one switch here. And this is the phase two. Now, don't
touch the phase two until the last possible moment. Do you
understand?&nbsp;<br>
VORG: I've got that. Phase one, phase two. Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
PLETRAC: What are you doing? <br>
SHIRNA: The Doctor's going back into the Scope. <br>
PLETRAC: You will remain here. You came here illegally. Regulations
demand that you be sent to the ICCA. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the ICCA? <br>
VORG: The Inner Constellation Corrective Authority. You won't like it,
Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Prison? <br>
PLETRAC: You are, by your own admission, a vagabond. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes, very much so. Phase one. <br>
(The Doctor has his hands on his contraption. Vorg pushes down the
handle and the Doctor vanishes.) <br>
PLETRAC: What? Er, stop! <br>
(Pletrac fires his weapon and the contraption goes bang.) <br>
VORG: Oh, no! <br>
SHIRNA: We'll never get him back now! <br>
(The Doctor wakes up inside the workings of the Scope.) <br>
SHIRNA: Can you fix it? <br>
VORG: I don't know. All these wires. <br>
SHIRNA: Well, you must try. <br>
VORG: Well, I'm doing my best. <br>
SHIRNA: The Doctor's relying on us. <br>
VORG: Well, put your finger on there a minute, will you? <br>
SHIRNA: Here? <br>
(Crackle, spark, squeal.) <br>
VORG: Good. That must be the live terminal.

SHIRNA: Is this part of something, Vorg? <br>
VORG: Hmm? Where'd you get that? <br>
SHIRNA: I found it in your bag. Do you know what it is? <br>
VORG: Huh. I haven't seen one of these since my national service days.
The old Fourteenth Heavy Lasers. Oh, what an outfit. Our battery
sergeant was a Crustasoid mercenary with <br>

think the seed is under. <br>

VORG: The middle one? You wouldn't like to wager, say, a couple of
credit bars on your judgement, would you? <br>

under the middle pod. One can hardly discount the evidence of one's
eyes. <br>
