GAVROK: Take no prisoners! Kill them all! <br>
(A young woman in white is defended by two green aliens. They kill one
of their attackers, who retaliate. As Gavrok sounds a horn, the young
woman shoots, cracking it.) <br>
DELTA: Are you strong enough to run? <br>
CHIMA: Run where? They've firebombed every ship we have. <br>
DELTA: Then we'll have to take one of theirs. Now! <br>

DOCTOR: It's strange how in some galaxies these tollports spring up all
over the place like mushrooms, yet in others you can go for light years
without seeing a single one. <br>
MEL: Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: I think it relates to the way that space is being developed. I
mean, there never has been a consistent three dimensional planning
policy. <br>
MEL: Doctor, something doesn't look right. Only the landing lights are
on. It looks abandoned. <br>
DOCTOR: And by completely ignoring the overspill from the fourth
dimension they sometimes build one port right on top of the other, only
realising it when there's an interface slippage. <br>
MEL: Doctor, this is serious. There's something wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it is serious. I don't seem to have any change. Er, take
five credits from the kitty, Mel. <br>
(Mel takes a tin can from under the console and looks inside.) <br>
MEL: There's nothing in here again. <br>

the Doctor comes out carefully.) <br>

MEL: Me too. It's spooky. <br>

sequined jacket and peaked cap.) <br>
TOLLMASTER: Surprise, surprise! <i>By Jove, yes.</i>
Welcome, friends. A thousand welcomes. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a funny way to welcome your friends. We thought you'd been
attacked by space pirates. Now, about this toll fee <br>
TOLLMASTER: Toll fee? Tonight is your lucky night. <i>Because </i>You
are our ten billionth customer. <br>
<i> DOCTOR: Ten billion customers? <br>
TOLLMASTER: And one. <br>

here? <br>
TOLLMASTER: Exactly. <br>
DOCTOR: Congratulations. Now, about this toll fee. <br>
TOLLMASTER: But, but you've won! You've won the grand prize. <br>
MEL: What is it? I've never won anything before. <br>
TOLLMASTER: <i>Your prize. Hang about. </i>You have won
our fabulous Fifties tour. A week, a whole week, in Disneyland, planet
Earth. And this time, they're going back to 1959. The rock and roll
years. <br>
MEL: Oh, that's fantastic! Oh, let's go, Doctor. Please agree. <i>Our
last holiday wasn't exactly ice hot. Oh, please? <br>

HAWK: Me neither. <br>

telephone box is standing on a piece of parched earth near a wood when
a Morris Minor car BUO193 pulls up and two portly men get out. One is
wearing an NY logo baseball cap and jacket, and is therefore an
American. Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443401/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Stubby Kaye</a>. He goes
up to the police box and pulls out the telephone which is, of course,
marked for public use.) <br>
WEISMULLER: Hello, will you put me through to the White House,
Washington DC? This is a priority call, code eleven. <br>
(His companion takes a telescope from the car boot and surveys their
surroundings.) <br>
WEISMULLER: Hello? This is Agent Jerome P Weismuller speaking from
Wales, in England. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, oh yes, sir. We'll get right
on it, sir. <br>
(He puts the telephone back and his companion comes over. He is also
American.) <br>
HAWK: Well? <br>
WEISMULLER: That was the President's right hand man. Wow! <br>
HAWK: Come on, Weismuller, spill the beans. Why the red alert? <br>
WEISMULLER: He says that Cape Canaveral has fired a space rocket with
an artificial satellite. <br>
HAWK: This is history in the making, Weismuller. What are we supposed
to do about it? <br>
WEISMULLER: Surveillance, Hawk, surveillance. We've been selected. It's
our job to track the thing. <br>

ourselves? <br>
TOLLMASTER: Oh, no. You're going on a scheduled tour with the
Navarino's 1950's club. <br>
DOCTOR: Navarinos from the tribe on Navarro? Squat, wrinkly, purply
creatures? Won't they be a little conspicuous on Earth? <br>
TOLLMASTER: Oh, I don't think so. Not now. They've been through a
transformation arch. <i>Now, follow me. We must stick to time.
Everyone knows I'm a stickler for time.</i><br>
(The transformation process appears to be uncomfortable.) <br>

BOLLIT: Don't be a coward. <br>
ADLON: Come on, it doesn't hurt. Come on, come on. That's it.<br>

his passengers.) <br>
MURRAY: Thank you very much. Thank you. <br>
(The Tollmaster takes the Doctor and Mel to the charabanc, Nostalgia
Trips.) <br>
DOCTOR: Who's that? <br>
TOLLMASTER: Oh, that's Murray, your pilot. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, this is going to be very interesting. <br>
MEL: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: Nostalgia Trips, the most notorious travel firm in the five
galaxies. It was a Nostalgia Trip cruiser that got stuck with the glass
eaters of Tharl. <br>
MEL: Oh, dear. <br>
TOLLMASTER: Yes, well, they may have had one or two little problems in
the past, but that's all sorted out now. <br>
MEL: But the brochure shows a space cruiser, not an old bus. <br>
TOLLMASTER: Old bus? This is a very expensive conversion. The chassis
and the engine, they're from a Helstrom Two, the very latest thing in
space cruisers. The old-fashioned bodywork, well, that's just to please
the tourists. We're not fools, you know. <br>
MURRAY: I've been through that thing a hundred times and I still don't
like it. Oh, welcome aboard. I'm Murray. <br>
MEL: I'm Mel and this is the Doctor. <br>
MURRAY: That's great. Knowing Nostalgia Trips, we may need a doctor.
Come on, folks. All aboard! <br>
DOCTOR: Mel, you go ahead on the bus. I'll follow on in the Tardis. <br>
MEL: Thanks. <br>
MURRAY: Oh, you don't think the old bus'll make it, Doctor? Underneath
this streamliner shell is a Helstrom Fireball engine. None finer. <br>
TOLLMASTER: Come along, folks. All aboard. Have fun. Remember your
time. 1959. <i>Is that your husband or have you brought the
bulldog with you? Oh, kiss me quick. My goodness me, what a time we're
going to have.</i> </font></p>

HAWK: No signal from the satellite? <br>
WEISMULLER: No. Come on down. You try. I tell you, it's hopeless, Hawk.

responsibility, you know. <br>
WEISMULLER: Let me tell you something. If they think we fouled up,
they'll be ringing us every five minutes. Now you go ahead and make

HAWK: What's up? <br>
WEISMULLER: Bad news. That satellite has gone haywire, and the
scientists think it's going to fall to Earth somewhere around here. <i>And
the President wants us to find it before certain enemy powers get their
mitts on it. <br>

did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I simply applied the Tardis vortex drive to generate an
antigravity spiral to halt your descent. Sorry about the bumpy landing.
A miscalculation. <br>

Murray and the mod in the shades hangs about nearby.) <br>

hello, Mel. Nice trip? <br>

sort of way station. <br>

longer exists.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Play area]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Bannermen are all trussed up, with Mel and
Ray standing guard with their own weapons.) <br>
WEISMULLER: Boy, you're the sorriest bunch of Bannermen I've ever seen.
<br>
DELTA: Thank you for your help and courage. All of you. <br>
MEL: Are Billy and the Doctor all right? <br>
DELTA: Yes. Billy's just changing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Billy's chalet]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Billy is wearing a white spacesuit. His skin is
getting shinier and his hair darker.) <br>
DOCTOR: I know without a male the race will be wiped out, but I haven't
seen many examples of species crossing. There could be the most
dreadful mutation. <br>
BILLY: It's our only chance, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't condone this foolishness, but then, love has never been
known for its rationality. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Main hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GORONWY: And then, you see, the new young queen
comes along and the whole colony swarms all around her, and off they go
to find a new hive. A new hive and a new life. <br>
HAWK: That's amazing. <br>
GORONWY: Well, let's go and see what's happening. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Gavrok's spaceship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WEISMULLER: Well, that should hold them all the
way back to Mars, or wherever you're going. <br>
DELTA: Considerably further than that. <br>
(Billy drives the Doctor over there on his bike. Mel meets them.) <br>
WEISMULLER: Bye. <br>
DELTA: Bye-bye. <br>
(Weismuller leaves. Billy takes his guitar and suitcase onto the
spacecraft.) <br>
BILLY: Everything ship-shape? <br>
DELTA: Yes. <br>
BILLY: I'll just stow all my gear. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Play area]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RAY: What are you thinking, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I was just speculating what this vehicle would be like with
more sophisticated braking and suspension systems. <br>
RAY: Are you kidding? This is the best there is. <br>
DELTA: I don't know how I can ever thank you for what you've done.
You've saved my planet and my people. You will always be welcome. <br>
BILLY: Goodbye, everyone. I'll always think of you here at Shangri La,
Ray. <br>
RAY: Goodbye, Billy. I won't forget you, either. <br>
BILLY: Oh, I almost forgot. Will you look after the Vincent for me?
Remember to feather the clutch. <br>
(Billy, Delta and her daughter go back into the spacecraft. Ray starts
up the Vincent.) <br>
RAY: Bye. <br>
ALL: Bye! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Gavrok's spaceship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SINGER: Love is the answer. Here's to the future. <br>
BILLY: Let's make this baby fly. <br>
(Delta works the controls and it takes off.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside Shangri La]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor goes up to the Tardis.) <br>
MEL: Stop! <br>
DOCTOR: No, don't worry. Gavrok absorbed so much energy that the device
has lost all its power. <br>
(The Doctor knocks the cone off the top of the Tardis with his
umbrella.) <br>
DOCTOR: Way hey. Ah, Mister Burton. Thank you for saving Mel's life. <br>
BURTON: No, thank you, Doctor. I haven't had such a shindig since I
went buffalo hunting in Africa. Oh, it's a ferocious brute, you know,
the buffalo. <br>
GORONWY: 1928, hibiscus blossom. <br>
(The Doctor takes the proffered jar of honey.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, what a sweet gesture. Oh, you're more than a collector,
Goronwy. You're a man of taste. <br>
BURTON: Oh, good heavens. The Skegness Glee Club, and I haven't got any
staff. <br>
(A charabanc pulls up.) <br>
BURTON: Oh, I'll have to go. Goodbye, my dear. <br>
MEL: Goodbye. <br>
(Burton runs over to his customers.) <br>
BURTON: Ah, welcome, campers. Now I am your camp leader while you are
at Shangri La. My name is Burton. <br>
DOCTOR: I believe this is your satellite, gentlemen. <br>
(It is hanging up on the camp fence. The Doctor gestures for Mel to get
into the Tardis, then raises his hat to Goronwy and follows her.) <br>
WEISMULLER: We did it! We actually did it, Hawk. <br>
HAWK: It's wonderful! It's wonderful! <br>
WEISMULLER: Thanks, Doctor. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises. The last line of the song we hear is 'Happy
days are here again'.) </font> </p>
