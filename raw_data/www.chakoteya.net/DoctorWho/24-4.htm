upper railings stand people in white uniforms with Prussian style hats
- the ones with a nasty spike sticking out of the top. Another waits
downstairs. A woman, also in white, leads in six people. Everyone say
Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0703946/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
Patricia Quinn</a> aka Magenta from the Rocky Horror Picture
Show.) <br>
BELAZS: Halt! <br>
KRACAUER: Oh, you lucky, lucky people. You are the chosen ones, the
elite, specially selected to join our force of mercenaries and create
fear and terror wherever you go. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0652150/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Tony
Osoba</a>, back again after eight years.) <br>
ZED: We were tricked. <br>
KRACAUER: Kane has paid seventeen crowns for each of you, and he
insists on value for money. <br>
ZED: Seventeen crowns? You couldn't even buy a dog for seventeen
crowns. <br>
KRACAUER: Precisely. I wouldn't have paid seventeen crowns for the lot
of you, let alone each. <br>
(Kracauer pushes him back and he falls, touching one of the boxes
giving out the dry ice. It burns.) <br>
KRACAUER: Only frostburn. <br>
ZED: Frostburn? <br>
KRACAUER: Liquid nitrogen. Minus two hundred Celsius. Just be thankful
your arm didn't go inside the vat, otherwise it would never have come
out again. Right, freeze them. <br>
ZED: Wait! You mean we're going to be frozen? <br>
KRACAUER: Until Kane needs your services, yes. What's the matter,
getting cold feet? <br>
(Belazs moves the other men out. Zed hits the remaining guard, takes
his weapon and tries to run for it. Kracauer starts shooting.) <br>
KRACAUER: Kill him! <br>
(Zed runs through a door.) <br>
KRACAUER: Leave him. He's in the restricted zone. He's a dead man. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Zed has gone into a room where an old man is
chiseling at a huge slab of ice. He trips and drops his newly acquired
weapon into a vat. A white clad arm with gold braid reaches in and
takes it out, handing it back. Zed drops it on the floor, where it
shatters, then the pale faced man puts his hands on ??'s face, and he
dies.) <br>

MEL: Where is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Iceworld. A space trading colony on the dark side of the planet
Svartos. Space travellers stop there for supplies. I've been picking up
a faint tracking signal for some time. I think there's something
interesting going on there, Mel. </font></p>

daughter away. The tannoy makes an announcement.) <br>

department. Photon refrigeration units for only twenty four ninety

(The Tardis materialises. Only the little girl looks up as Mel and the
Doctor come out.) <br>
MEL: A freezer centre? How boring. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, trust not appearances, Mel. You never know what might be
lurking in the freezer chests. Think gothic. <br>

smile.) <br>

a well built teenaged waitress. Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0017644/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Sophie Aldred</a>.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, two of your best strawberry milkshakes, if you please. <br>
ANDERSON: Certainly, sir. <br>
GLITZ: There must be some mistake in the reckoning. <br>
(The Doctor and Mel sit at the next table, and he takes out a book to
read. The Doctor's Dilemma, by Bernard Shaw.) <br>
ACE: The mistake's in your wallet, not my arithmetic. <br>
GLITZ: Do you take Asteroid Express? <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz! <br>
MEL: Glitz! <br>
(Ace takes the credit card and goes to the bar as the Doctor and Mel
join Glitz at his table.) <br>
GLITZ: What? No, never heard of him. <br>
MEL: It's us, Mel and the Doctor. You haven't forgotten us, have you,
Glitz? <br>
GLITZ: Shush. Keep your voice down. No, of course I haven't forgotten
you. Mel, and the Doc. Here, you're not the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I've regenerated. The difference is purely perceptual. <br>
GLITZ: Here, you couldn't do us a favour, could you? You see, I'm in a
spot of bother. <br>
(Ace brings the Doctor and Mel's drinks.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's this, Glitz? Not another one of your dodgy deals
backfired? <br>
GLITZ: No, no, nothing like that, straight up. Fact is, I'm on a
mission of highly philanthropic nature. <br>
MEL: What's that? <br>
GLITZ: It means it's beneficial to mankind. <br>
MEL: We know what philanthropic means. What's the mission? <br>
GLITZ: I have been entrusted to deliver certain secret documents which
nefarious unnamed parties would stop at nothing to grasp within their
own grubby digits. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean <br>
MEL: They'd kill you. <br>
(Three of Kane's white clad mercenaries. Belazs touches Glitz'
shoulder.) <br>
BELAZS: Sabalom Glitz, we've been looking for you. <br>
MEL: Leave him alone. If you kill him, you kill us too. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, steady on there, Mel. <br>
BELAZS: What are you talking about? <br>
MEL: Oh, he's told us everything, about how you tried to stop him
delivering secret documents <br>
GLITZ: Shush. <br>
BELAZS: Becoming quite a story-teller, aren't we, Glitz? I'm afraid you
also seem to be a victim of Mister Glitz's cavalier attitude toward
facts. <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz. <br>
BELAZS: I'm not interested in any secret documents which Mister Glitz
may or may not possess. I am more concerned with the hundred crowns he
took from my employer, Mister Kane, under false pretences. <br>
GLITZ: That was highest quality merchandise. <br>
BELAZS: A space freighter full of deep frozen fruit which turned out to
be rotten. <br>
GLITZ: Oh, a bit on the ripe side, maybe. <br>
BELAZS: They were putrefying, Glitz. <br>
GLITZ: A little past their prime, perhaps. <br>
BELAZS: And Mister Kane does not run Iceworld to subsidise crooks like
yourself. The hundred crowns, please. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you'd better pay back the money, Glitz. <br>
GLITZ: I can't. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
GLITZ: Well, you see, there was this game of cards. I got well damaged.
<br>
BELAZS: What about the hundred and two crowns you sold your crew for? <br>
(The Doctor returns to his book.) <br>
MEL: Sold your crew? <br>
GLITZ: Well, the mutinous rabble, they tried to take command of my
spacecraft. I relieved myself of them for seventeen crowns a piece.
Rather more than they were worth, I think. <br>
BELAZS: The money. <br>
GLITZ: Gone the way of all organic matter, I'm afraid. Down the tube. <br>
BELAZS: In that case, we're confiscating your spacecraft. <br>
GLITZ: The Nosferatu? You can't do that. <br>
BELAZS: You have seventy two hours to find one hundred crowns or you
lose your spacecraft. <br>
GLITZ: But it's my livelihood. <br>
(Belazs and the two mercenaries leave.) <br>
GLITZ: Doctor, you've got to help me. <br>
DOCTOR: You've only got yourself to blame. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The remaining members of Glitz's crew go into
freezer alcoves.) <br>
KRACAUER: We're going to have trouble with this lot when you defrost
them, Mister Kane. <br>
KANE: Trouble? <br>
KRACAUER: They didn't volunteer willingly. <br>
KANE: None of my mercenary force will be willing when I bring them out
of cryosleep. The process causes complete loss of memory. With no
memories they can have no past, no future, no will of their own, no
purpose except to obey me. Through them I shall be invincible. My power
shall be absolute. </font></p>

lip or you're out on your ear. <br>
(Ace delivers a drink to a customer then goes to Mel and the Doctor.
Glitz is listening in from his table.) <br>
ACE: Hope the dragon gets you in the night. <br>
MEL: Dragon? What dragon? <br>
ACE: It's just a legend. There's supposed to be a terrifying dragon
living in the ice passages underneath Iceworld. <br>
MEL: I knew there must be a reason why you brought us here. You want to
see the dragon, don't you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh really, Mel, it's fascinating. Travellers claim to have seen
it throughout the centuries but there's never been any proof. <br>
MEL: Like the Lock Ness monster. <br>
DOCTOR: Loch. <br>
MEL: Och! <br>
ACE: You're going to go looking for the dragon? <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely. <br>
ACE: Oh, cool. Can I come too? <br>
DOCTOR: Won't you get into trouble with your boss? <br>
ACE: Oh, I'm fed up with being a waitress. Oh, go on, Professor, let me
come too. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don't see why not. <br>
ACE: Ace! And can we search for the treasure, too? <br>
DOCTOR: Treasure? <br>
ACE: Yeah. The dragon's supposed to be guarding a fabulous treasure. <br>
GLITZ: (laughs) Treasure? What treasure? You don't want to go believing
in myths and legends, Doctor. <br>
MEL: Who asked you? We're not talking to you. <br>
GLITZ: No, if you want my opinion, all this talk of treasure and
dragons, it's all a load of old spacedust. <br>
ACE: Well, if you're so convinced it's all rubbish, why have you been
burning holes in this treasure map for the last two days? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BELAZS: He says he lost the money in a game of
cards. <br>
KANE: I know he lost the money in a game of cards. The game was fixed.
What about the map? <br>
BELAZS: He's convinced it's genuine. <br>
KANE: Excellent. He'll soon realise if he wants to see his spacecraft
again he has no alternative but to go after the treasure. And when he
does, I shall be with him every step of the way. <br>
BELAZS: There's just one thing. <br>
KANE: Yes? <br>
BELAZS: He appears to have two colleagues. <br>
KANE: Colleagues? I thought he sold his entire crew. <br>
BELAZS: They're not from his crew, sir. Space travellers. A man and a
girl. Do you want them eliminated? <br>
KANE: Not for the moment, I think. There's no reason for them to
suspect that the seal on the treasure map contains a tracking device. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is studying the map.) <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. <br>
MEL: Looks like something from a jumble sale to me. <br>
GLITZ: Oi, there's nothing snide about this document. <br>
ACE: You don't want to believe nothing you get from him, Professor. He
probably bought two hundred of them in a job lot. <br>
GLITZ: Do you mind? This is the real McCoy, this is. It comes from an
unimpeachable source. <br>
ACE: What's that, then? <br>
GLITZ: That means it is beyond reproach or question. <br>
ACE: I know what unimpeachable means, bird bath, but what makes you so
certain this map's pedigree is twenty four carat? <br>
GLITZ: Because I acquired it from a man of character and distinction. <br>
MEL: How? <br>
GLITZ: I won it in er, a chess match. <br>
MEL: You won it playing cards. Doctor, it's a waste of time. He won it
in a card game. <br>
GLITZ: An honest transaction. The man was desperate not to lose this
map, so I know it's something very, very tasty. <br>
DOCTOR: It shows the lower levels of Iceworld. <br>
ACE: No one goes down there any more. Too dangerous. <br>
DOCTOR: The Ice Garden, the Singing Trees. <br>
GLITZ: But like the girl says, Doctor, it's too dangerous. <br>
DOCTOR: Where's your sense of adventure, Glitz? <br>
GLITZ: What, do you want to go here, the Lake of Oblivion? <br>
DOCTOR: Where? <br>
GLITZ: Depth of Eternal Darkness? Dragonfire? I should stop at home, if
I were you. <br>
ACE: Cor, this sounds brill. <br>
DOCTOR: My sentiments precisely. What's your name, incidentally? <br>
ACE: Everyone calls me Ace. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, how do you do. I'm the Doctor and this is my friend Mel. <br>
ACE: And we're really going to go looking for dragons? <br>
GLITZ: Too risky if you ask me. <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense, Glitz. Time for a quick adventure then back for tea. <br>
ACE: Ace! <br>
MEL: That's the spirit, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor folds up the map.) <br>
GLITZ: Hang about! You can't go without me, that's my map. And I don't
want these girls coming along, either. <br>
ACE: What? <br>
GLITZ: It's too dangerous. <br>
ACE: Professor! <br>
GLITZ: And since it's my map <br>
ACE: Right, you male chauvinist bilge bag, just you wait. <br>
(Ace leaves.) <br>
GLITZ: Oh, nice. <br>
DOCTOR: And I was so looking forward to meeting a dragon. <br>
MEL: Oh, it's all right, Doctor, you go on ahead. I'll wait here. And
if Glitz burns his fingers in the dragon's fire, then it serves him
right. <br>
GLITZ: It's just you and me, then, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor stops to tickle a hairy child under the chin. It barks and
snarls at him.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BELAZS: They have left the upper levels now. <br>
KANE: Only two of them, you say? <br>
BELAZS: Glitz and the traveller called the Doctor. They're just setting
off for the lower levels. <br>
KANE: Excellent. Continue to monitor the tracking device. Well? <br>
BELAZS: It's Glitz's spacecraft. <br>
KANE: What of it? <br>
BELAZS: It's just that <br>
KANE: Yes? <br>
BELAZS: Well, if Glitz and the Doctor are as good as dead, I'd like the
spacecraft. <br>
KANE: Oh, you'd like the spacecraft, would you? When you first came
here you had nothing. You were willing enough to take my payment then.
But now you want to leave. Perhaps you have memories of a home you can
return to? Perhaps I should have put you into cryosleep along with all
the others and erased your memories. <br>
(Kane takes Belazs' face with one hand and holds up his ungloved hand
to it. She flinches and he takes her left hand instead.) <br>
KANE: Perhaps you need reminding. As long as you bear my mark, I own
you. <br>
(Her palm has the imprint of a coin burnt into it. Kane activates the

MEL: I'm going now. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right, yes, you're going. Been gone for ages. Already
gone, still here, just arrived, haven't even met you yet. It all
depends on who you are and how you look at it. Strange business, time. <br>
MEL: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Mel. Think about me when you're living your life one
day after another, all in a neat pattern. Think about the homeless
traveller and his old police box, with his days like crazy paving. <br>
MEL: Who said anything about home? I've got much more crazy things to
do yet. <br>
(They hug. Glitz enters with Ace.) <br>
GLITZ: Well, we've officially renamed my new spacecraft the Nosferatu
Two, just cracked a bottle of ye old carbonated fruit alcohol over the
bows and next stop sunny Perivale, eh, sprog? <br>
ACE: Suppose so. <br>
MEL: Have you got room for another one? <br>
GLITZ: Are you Perivale bound as well? <br>
MEL: Well, I was thinking of going a bit further. <br>
GLITZ: How much further? <br>
MEL: How much further are you going? <br>
GLITZ: Hang on half a millisecond. <br>
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, Mel can keep you out of trouble, Glitz. <br>
MEL: And that means no more dodgy deals. <br>
GLITZ: Thanks a billion, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz. <br>
MEL: Ace doesn't have anywhere to go. <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense. An idyllic place, Perivale. It's got lush green
fields and a village blacksmith, and <br>
MEL: Doctor, she comes from the twentieth century. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
GLITZ: Come on, Mel. Extract your digit. <br>
MEL: I'll send you a postcard. <br>
DOCTOR: But I don't have an address. <br>
MEL: Oh, I'll put it in a bottle and throw it into space. It'll reach
you, in time. <br>
(Glitz and Mel leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ace, where do you think you're going? <br>
ACE: Perivale. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah yes, but by which route? The direct route with Glitz, or the
scenic route? Well? Do you fancy a quick trip round the twelve galaxies
and then back to Perivale in time for tea? <br>
ACE: Ace! <br>
DOCTOR: But there are three rules. One, I'm in charge. <br>
ACE: Whatever you say, Professor. <br>
DOCTOR: Two, I'm not the Professor, I'm the Doctor. <br>
ACE: Whatever you want. <br>
DOCTOR: And the third. Well, I'll think up the third by the time we get
back to Perivale. </font></p>
