with a brown waistcoat, is hanging about in a corridor. A woman's face
appears at an opening high up in the wall, with an X next to it.) <br>
WOMAN: Citizen Cordo, District Four? <br>
CORDO: Yes? <br>
WOMAN: Congratulations, Citizen. Your father ceased at one ten. <br>
CORDO: All was well? <br>
WOMAN: A fine death. Body weight was eighty four kilos at termination. <br>
CORDO: I'm gratified. <br>
WOMAN: Gatherer Hade is waiting for the death taxes. <br>
CORDO: Yes, I have them here. <br>
WOMAN: Pay them at the Gatherer's office. </font></p>

turban bearing a stylised sun with a face on it, is humming to himself
whilst reading a scroll. Outside, Cordo rings the bell.) <br>
HADE: Let him enter. <br>
(Cordo enters, and walks nervously along a narrow path between two rows
of rib-like arches.) <br>
HADE: Well, Citizen. Death taxes? Not on the desk. It might scar. <br>
CORDO: Oh, it is wood, your honour. <br>
HADE: Mmm, of a kind called ma-ho-gany. I don't suppose you've ever
seen wood before, have you, Citizen? <br>
CORDO: No, never. But we learned about it at preparation centre. There
was even a picture of a tree! A fine thing. <br>
HADE: Simply a primitive way of producing oxygen. Thank the Company we
have no need of trees on Pluto. <br>
CORDO: Praise the Company. <br>
(An underling hands a blue plastic sheet down to Hade.) <br>
HADE: Is this your account, Citizen? I see you selected the golden
death, with four mercy attendants. <br>
CORDO: Yes, your honour. I always pledged that when his death day came
he would not suffer. <br>
HADE: Compassion is a noble thing, Citizen. Also costly. A hundred and
seventeen talmars. <br>
CORDO: One hundred and seven? No, it can't be. <br>
HADE: See the account. <br>
CORDO: But there's a mistake. Eighty, they said. Eighty for the golden
death. <br>
HADE: The Collector recently raised death taxes seventeen percent. <br>
CORDO: I didn't know, your Honour. <br>
HADE: It was bulletined. <br>
CORDO: But I didn't see it. <br>
HADE: It is every citizen's duty to know the tax rates. <br>
CORDO: I've been working double shifts to earn the money. <br>
HADE: Four mercy attendants is now a further eighteen talmars. Disposal
fee ten talmars plus of course an ad valorum tax of ten percent. Total
one hundred and thirty two talmars. It's all here, you see, and said we
put your father's personal contribution of seven talmars. Only seven
talmars, Citizen? Must have been a poor man. <br>
CORDO: He was a municipal servant for forty years, your Honour. He
cleaned the walkways. <br>
HADE: And then there's the recycling allowance on his death weight of
eighty four kilos. That is eight talmars. Leaving a debt of a hundred
and seventeen. <br>
CORDO: Please, I have only eighty six. It has taken me years to save
it. <br>
(Hade picks up the pouch by its strap with his long staff of office.) <br>
HADE: How do you propose to settle the thirty one talmars outstanding? <br>
CORDO: Well, I can't. Your Honour, I have nothing. <br>
HADE: Taxes are the primary consideration, Citizen. I see that you are
a D grade worker in the Foundry. <br>
CORDO: Yes, your Honour. <br>
HADE: Fortunately, as the Gatherer, I have certain powers. I will
encourage your supervisor to allow you increased output. <br>
CORDO: But, your Honour, I already work a double shift now! I have only
my three hours sleep time away from the Foundry. <br>
HADE: Twenty one hours a week. You must manage without sleep time until
the debt is paid. <br>
CORDO: It will kill me! <br>
HADE: Take your Q capsule. <br>
CORDO: But your Honour, the high medical tax on Q capsules! <br>
HADE: Citizen Cordo, you complain too much. Thank the Company you're
warm and fed. <br>
CORDO: Praise the Company. <br>
HADE: You may go. <br>

LEELA: There? <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>

K9: Bishop to queen six. Mistress! <br>
LEELA: There? <br>

LEELA: Well, the column's stopped moving. <br>
DOCTOR: So? <br>
LEELA: It is not important? <br>
DOCTOR: What?! <br>

DOCTOR: We might have gone right through the time spiral! Why didn't

DOCTOR: You didn't. <br>
LEELA: I did! <br>

LEELA: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: We're still in the Solar System. Pluto? <br>
LEELA: Pluto? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Pluto. <br>

empty industrial site, with the bare metal bones of units behind them
and gravel underfoot. It is apparently the top of a very tall building,
actually the roof of the WD+HO Wills tobacco factory in Bristol.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quite warm. Around twenty degrees. Very humid. <br>
LEELA: It is like Earth, except that the air is scented. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all wrong. It shouldn't be like Earth. Unless, of course,
the Sun's turned nova. <br>
LEELA: Doctor, look! <br>
(They are actually on the roof of a very tall building.) <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating. <br>

DOCTOR: What an engineering achievement, eh? <br>
(Cordo is walking across the flat roof. Leela taps the Doctor's arm.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't joggle, Leela. Don't joggle. You can look in a minute. <br>
(Cordo climbs over a guard rail a little way away from them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Must have taken them centuries to build a city like that. <br>
(Leela runs towards Cordo.) <br>
LEELA: Hey! <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: Come down! Please, come back! <br>
DOCTOR: Don't touch him! <br>
LEELA: Doctor! Please, don't jump. <br>
DOCTOR: Magnificent view, isn't it. How high is this building? <br>
CORDO: A thousand metres. <br>
DOCTOR: A thousand metres? My. Are we interrupting something? <br>
CORDO: What would you say, Citizen? <br>
DOCTOR: Somehow I have the impression you're thinking of killing
yourself. <br>
CORDO: It's the taxes. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
CORDO: It's the taxes. I can't pay the taxes. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the taxes. My dear old thing, all you need is a wiley
accountant. Would you care for a jelly baby? Hmm? Try one. <br>
CORDO: What? <br>
DOCTOR: They're rather good. <br>
(Looks more like liquorice allsorts to me. As Cordo reaches towards the
bag, Leela tips him back over the guard rail.) <br>

HADE: District Four. <br>
MARN: The data vibes also indicate illegal landing. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CORDO: Then there's the medical tax on Q-capsules,
and work tax on extra hours, so I could never clear the debt. You see,
the Company charges fifty percent compound interest on unpaid taxes.
I'm only a grade D work unit, three talmars a shift. Three talmars.
That's not enough. <br>
LEELA: What is he saying, Doctor? I do not understand. <br>
DOCTOR: He can't make ends meet. Probably too many economists in the
government. <br>
LEELA: These taxes, they are like sacrifices to tribal gods? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, roughly speaking, but paying tax is more painful. <br>
LEELA: Then the people should rise up and slaughter their oppressors! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if little Cordo's at all typical, they haven't any spirit
left for fighting. <br>
(A wailing noise fills the air.) <br>
CORDO: It's the Gatherer! Quick, run! <br>

LEELA: Run, Doctor! It's the Gatherer! <br>

MARN: Your Honour, it's inconceivable. To flout so many regulations. <br>
HADE: Exactly. I smell something very big. Perhaps another Kandor
conspiracy. <br>
MARN: What was that? <br>
HADE: Oh yes, Kandor. <br>
MARN: I never heard of it. <br>
HADE: Yes, it wasn't made public at the time in case it gave others
ideas. Kandor was an executive grade in Megropolis Four who falsified
computer records for the enrichment of himself and his fellow
conspirators. Altogether he defrauded the Company of millions of
talmars. <br>

MARN: You mean the instruction will not be retained in records? But

HADE: Does the robber hesitate to break a window? We're not dealing
here, Marn, with some snivelling tax defaulter. This is a carefully
planned criminal enterprise. <br>
MARN: To what end, your Honour? <br>
HADE: To defraud the Company of its rightful revenues by smuggling
contraband goods into the Megropolis. I see the magnitude of the
offence astounds you. <br>
MARN: Well, it's hard to believe such depths of criminality. <br>
HADE: It exists, Marn. It exists. Despite the screening and the
Preparation Centres and the air conditioning, criminal deviants occur
in every generation. Enemies of the Company. On old Earth they had a
saying. There's one rotten acorn in every barrel. We must find this

CORDO: It is said they live in the Undercity. Outlaws, tax criminals,
some who've escaped from the Correction Centre. Perhaps they will help
me, if they exist. <br>
LEELA: If you are not sure they exist, how do you expect to find them? <br>
CORDO: I know the secret way to the Undercity. You see, my father was
an E grade work unit. He cleaned the walkways all his life. He learned
the secret. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll come with you. <br>

CORDO: But you don't understand, Citizens. My father looked in once. He
said there is no light, nothing. It is not possible to imagine such a
thing. <br>
LEELA: You mean it is dark. <br>
CORDO: What is dark? <br>
LEELA: Well, at night, when the sun has gone. <br>
DOCTOR: He means there's no night on this planet, Leela. That's why the
concept of darkness frightens him. <br>
LEELA: But that is not possible. Every planet must have a night. <br>
DOCTOR: Not if the sidereal and axial rotation periods are the same, or
if there's more than one sun. <br>
CORDO: There are six. <br>
DOCTOR: What, six suns on Pluto? <br>
CORDO: Well, everyone knows that. Each Megropolis was given its own

implement contingency plan A. <br>
(The Collector goes to a computer panel, opens it and reaches for a
lever. The Doctor laughs.) <br>
COLLECTOR: This switch controls the sprinkler valves throughout the
City. <br>
DOCTOR: Rain stops play. I don't think that'll damp down this
revolution. <br>
COLLECTOR: The sprinklers will release dianene, a deadly poison. Within
ten seconds, everyone in the City will be dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Except you. <br>
COLLECTOR: Exactly. I do not breathe air. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but this chap at my shoulder, he breathes air. <br>
COLLECTOR: Kill him! <br>
DOCTOR: Don't be a fool. <br>
COLLECTOR: Guard, kill him! <br>
(The guard puts his gun to the Doctor's head and Leela throws her
knife, getting him in the right shoulder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good throw! Good throw. <br>
(Leela runs round and slams the panel door hard against the Collector's
hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's contingency plan B? <br>
COLLECTOR: Nobody understands business is business. <br>
LEELA: What do we do now, Doctor, kill him? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll like this bit. You'll like it. <br>
(The Collector speaks into his intercom.) <br>
COLLECTOR: Nine zero nine! A mistake in the Megropolis Six analysis.
Recheck! <br>
(The Collector's skin is turning green.) <br>
COMPUTER: Nine zero nine. Recheck. Megropolis Six analysis confirmed
correct. <br>
(Guards run in as the Doctor laughs.) <br>
COLLECTOR: Commander! Arrest these idiots. I have a problem. Nine zero
nine. Megropolis Four analysis. Mistake. Recheck <br>
(Cordo and Mandrell enter.) <br>
COMPUTER: Nine zero nine. <br>
CORDO: Collector, in the name of the work units, I order <br>
LEELA: People, Cordo. <br>
CORDO: Yes. In the name of the people I order you to be tried by <br>
DOCTOR: Cordo, I don't think he's listening. <br>
COLLECTOR: Negative surplus. Inflationary spiral uncheckable. Negative
growth! This branch is no longer viable. <br>
(The Collector shrinks.) <br>
COLLECTOR: We are bankrupt. Business failure. Closure imperative. Cut
losses. Liquidate. Immediate liquidation. <br>
(The tiny green collector vanishes down a hole in his wheelchair.
Bisham runs in.) <br>
BISHAM: I'm sorry I'm late. What happened? <br>
MANDRELL: Well, I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: I do. He's gone back to his natural form. He was only held in
that state by particle radiation. That's why he never left that
machine. <br>
LEELA: You mean he's in there now? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. <br>
LEELA: Well, we could make a hole in it. <br>
CORDO: Do you think he'll come out again? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you could put the plug in if you want. <br>
(Cordo plugs the hole.) <br>
COMMANDER: I don't understand. Why was it necessary for him to make
himself look human? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you'd seen a Usurian you'd know what I mean. They look
like sea kale with eyes. I mean, would you take orders from a lump of
seaweed? Huh? Hmm? Cordo? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Leela, let K9 in the Tardis. Goodbye,
Cordo. <br>
CORDO: I wish you could stay, Doctor. There is much to do. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'll pop back and see you again when you've settled again
on Earth. <br>
BISHAM: That'll be hard work. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you're used to hard work. This time, you'll be free. <br>
LEELA: Goodbye, Veet. <br>
VEET: Goodbye. <br>
LEELA: Till the next time? Come on, K9. Come on. <br>
BISHAM: You really believe we can colonise the Earth again? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I do, I do. The Earth will have regenerated itself since
you left. Get back to your place under your own sun. <br>
ALL: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
MANDRELL: Can the star freighters make that journey? <br>
DOCTOR: Course they will. Three hundred million of you can't go wrong.
Goodbye everyone! <br>
ALL: Goodbye. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> K9: King to Bishop four, mistress. <br>
DOCTOR: Which is more than I can say for the Tardis. <br>
LEELA: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. I was just finishing a thought. Now, where were we? <br>
K9: Mate in six moves, master. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, be quiet, K9. <br>
LEELA: I wonder why the Collector gave in so easily? I thought he would
fight. <br>
DOCTOR: He got a bit of a shock. You see, I fed two percent growth tax
into the computers. Index linked. Blew the economy and he couldn't take
it. <br>
LEELA: I do not understand. You did something clever? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I. What do you think, K9? <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: K9 thinks it was clever. <br>
(The Tardis tilts. Leela, the hat stand and of course the chess pieces
all go flying.) <br>
DOCTOR: I am so sorry, K9. <br>
K9: Apologies are not necessary. <br>
DOCTOR: No, shut up while I apologise. I am so. Listen. As soon as I've
reset the coordinates, we'll finish that game of chess. </font> </p>
