<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif" size="2">(The Tardis materialises on a pavement, startling
the pigeons. The Doctor and Dodo come out and he hangs an 'Out of
Order' sign on the Tardis door. A policeman is walking along the
street.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose you know where you are, my dear. <br>
DODO: London. Home. It's marvellous to be back. It seems ages since I
left. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, when you've seen the ages that I've see, you won't use that
term quite so freely. Anyway, I don't think it's been all that long. <br>
DODO: Hey, what's that for? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well, you see, the problem is, coming back to the twentieth
century, my dear, the Tardis, I'm afraid, is often mistaken for the
real police box. <br>
(The policeman reads the sign and walks on.) <br>
DODO: I see what you mean. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and fortunately he can't get in. <br>
DODO: If only he could. Scotland Yard whipped off into time and space. <br>
DOCTOR: So that's it! <br>
DODO: What? Oh, the tower. It's finished! <br>
(The brand new Post Office Tower rises high above central London.) <br>
DOCTOR: Isn't that interesting. Very interesting. <br>
DODO: It's great, isn't it. Stephen would have liked it here. <br>
DOCTOR: You know there's something alien about that tower. I can sense
it. <br>
DODO: Smells okay to me. Good old London smoke. <br>
DOCTOR: I can feel it's got something sort of powerful. It's. Look at
my skin. Look at that. I've got that pricking sensation again, the
same. Just as I had when I saw the Daleks, those Daleks were near. <br>
DODO: Daleks? Who are they? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, er, yes, of course, you, er, you didn't meet them, did you,
child? No. No, and I pray that you never will. I really must
investigate it. <br>

Tower.) <br>
BRETT: Things are running all right? <br>

Wills</a> answers him.) <br>
POLLY: Yes, Professor. <br>
BRETT: Good. <br>
(A mustachioed man leads Dodo and the Doctor out of the lift.) <br>
GREEN: It is a splendid view, certainly. I think you'll enjoy it. <br>
DODO: Doctor, look at it. Isn't it terrific! <br>
GREEN: Professor Brett. <br>
BRETT: Ah, Doctor! I understand from Major Green you're a specialist in
computer development. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, hardly a specialist, sir, but I dabble, yes, I dabble.
Oh, so that's what it is. <br>
BRETT: I beg your pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you know I had a very strong sense of energy outside this
building, a sort of magnetic pull if you like. It was most unusual, so
I presume that's what it must have been. <br>
BRETT: It is indeed. It's my life's work, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Most ingenious. <br>
BRETT: I think I can go so far as to say that it's the only one in
existence in the world. It's at least ten years ahead of it's time. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that so? <br>
DODO: What makes it so special? <br>
BRETT: Well, Miss, er? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, ah, my secretary, Dodo Chaplet. <br>
BRETT: Well, Miss Chaplet, I'll explain. This is perhaps not the
biggest computer in the world, but it's certainly the most advanced. In
fact it can handle scientific problems well outside the range of any
other computer in existence. We are about to link this up with
computers all over the world as a central intelligence. A sort of
problem solver. <br>
DODO: I don't understand. <br>
BRETT: Well, perhaps it'll be clearer tonight. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, tonight, sir? <br>
BRETT: Yes, of course. Press conference. I thought your visit? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, of course, my dear fellow, yes, eh Dodo?
<br>
DODO: I call that very exciting. <br>
BRETT: Exciting. Look, this is my secretary, Polly. <br>
DODO: Hello, Polly. <br>
POLLY: How do you do. <br>
BRETT: Now Polly's pretty smart, a cracking typist, right? (Polly pulls
a face) Also rather a cheeky one at times. Well now this machine, which
I call WOTAN. <br>
DOCTOR: You call what? <br>
BRETT: "Vo tan." Spelt W O T A N. Will Operating Thought ANalogue. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, quite so. <br>
BRETT: Well now, WOTAN can not only think faster than Polly or myself,
it can also type faster. <br>
DODO: True? <br>
POLLY: Afraid so, and it never makes mistakes, wretched thing! <br>
(Dodo goes off with Polly.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you seriously telling me, sir, that you have invented a
machine that can think? <br>
BRETT: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And never makes mistakes? <br>
BRETT: Never. <br>
DOCTOR: I take it that I speak into here. <br>
BRETT: Yes, that's right, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, what is the square route of 17422? <br>
(The machine whirrs, then prints a number on a piece of paper.) <br>
BRETT: Correct? <br>
DOCTOR: One moment please. 131 point 993. Yes, that's near enough. Yes,
it's truly remarkable. <br>
DODO: May I try it now? <br>
BRETT: Certainly, go ahead. <br>
DODO: Now let's see, you funny looking contraption. Here's one you'll
never get. What does the word Tardis mean? <br>
(Dodo tears off the printed answer.) <br>
DODO: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what did it say my dear? <br>
DODO: Got it right. Time And Relative Dimensions In Space. <br>
DOCTOR: Good heavens! Let me see. Well now, how would it know that? <br>
BRETT: WOTAN knows a lot I don't know. There's something else I can
tell you, Miss Chaplet. Miss Chaplet? <br>
(Dodo has gone still, her face is blank.) <br>
DOCTOR: Dodo! <br>
DODO: Pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter my dear, are you All right? <br>
DODO: Oh, yes. Just a buzzing in the ears. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Just sit down a moment. <br>
DOCTOR: Now tell me, sir, now tell me, what part does this play? <br>
BRETT: Oh, that's the usual memory bank, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And that of course is the programme regimentator? <br>
BRETT: Yes, but in this case, a slightly different one. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder <br>
BRETT: Are you feeling better now? <br>
DODO: Oh, fine, thank you. <br>
BRETT: Good. Polly'll look after you. <br>
POLLY: Is this your first time in London? <br>
DODO: Oh, no. It feels like it though. I'm so out of touch. What I'd
really like is to go to the hottest night spot in town. <br>
POLLY: Oh well, that's easy. The Inferno. </font></p>

Polly and Dodo come down the stairs.) <br>
POLLY: Hi, Kitty. <br>
KITTY: Hello Polly, love. Oh, am I glad to see you! <br>
POLLY: Dodo, this is Kitty. Kitty, Dodo. <br>
DODO: Hello. <br>
KITTY: Hi, Dodo. Polly, you're just the person I need. Will you help
me? <br>
POLLY: Oh, here we go again. Not that I mind helping people. Well, what
is it then? <br>
KITTY: Well, when you were here last week, do you remember a sailor at
the end of the bar? <br>
POLLY: Not especially, why? <br>
KITTY: He's been here ever since. Poor lad, he just sits there at the
end of the bar. Look out, here he comes now. <br>
(A serious young man in an able seaman's uniform walks down the
stairs.) <br>
KITTY: Well, see? He's no great advertisement for the most with it
place in town, is he? Couldn't you cheer him up just a little? <br>
POLLY: All right, Kitty, leave it to us. Stand by, Dodo. This looks
like a rescue mission. The Navy's in trouble. Excuse me. <br>
(They head to the bar.) <br>
POLLY: Well, hello. We met the other night, remember?<br>
(Here is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187072/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Michael
Craze</a>.) <br>
BEN: Oh yeah, I think I do. <br>
POLLY: You think you do? Oh, I must have made a big impression on him. <br>
BEN: No, it's not that. <br>
POLLY: Well, what is it then? It must be something pretty big, not to
have noticed me. <br>
BEN: Well, I'm sorry. <br>
POLLY: Oh, he says he's sorry. <br>
BEN: Well there's no law against sitting' here is there? <br>
POLLY: Well, there should be when you've got that look on your face.
Look, I'll show you. <br>
(Polly goes to the other side of the bar and mimics Ben.) <br>
BEN: Is it as bad that then? <br>
DODO: Worse. <br>
POLLY: So, spill the beans, sailor. Give us the facts. What's your
problems? <br>
BEN: Ah, you wouldn't understand. You'd think I'm some kind of a nut. <br>
POLLY: Well, try us. <br>
BEN: Well, it's my ship, see. It's gone off to the West Indies and I've
got a shore posting. In barracks for six months. <br>
POLLY: And you'll miss the swaying palms, the white beaches, the blue
sea <br>
BEN: Very funny! If you've finished cheering me up. <br>
POLLY: Come on, Dodo, let's leave him. I can't stand people with no
sense of humour. <br>
DODO: Would you like some coffee? <br>
POLLY: I'd love some. <br>
(The girls head for the stairs and a mod blocks their way.) <br>
FLASH: Try me. I got a great sense of humour. Anything for a giggle. <br>
POLLY: Please take your arm away. <br>
FLASH: Oh, come on, darling'. I know your type. You'll have a better
time with me than with ol' shorty there. <br>
BEN: What's that? <br>
FLASH: Oh get lost. <br>
BEN: Let her go! <br>
FLASH: Look, go and play with your toy boats, half pint. <br>
(Ben gets Flash in an arm lock. Polly screams.) <br>
BEN: I said, let go of her. <br>
(Flash gets free and tries to hit Ben, but ends up on his back on the
floor instead.) <br>
BEN: Just try it, mate. I'll chop you in little bits. <br>
(Flash swings, Ben grabs his hand and has him on the floor again.) <br>
KITTY: What's all this? <br>
BEN: Nothing. One of you customers wants to go home. <br>
(Flash leaves.) <br>
BEN: You want to be careful who you encourage. <br>
POLLY: You conceited little <br>

Mervyn</a> addresses the assemblage. The Doctor enters during the
speech.) <br>
SUMMER: Gentleman, ladies, may I have your attention please? Well,
you're heard the backroom boys, now it's about time you my turn. C Day,
that is Computer Day, will be next Monday, July the 16th, that is in
four days time. Now on that date all the computer systems in this
country, and subsequently in the whole world will come under the
control of this central computer which we call WOTAN. Now, as you've
heard, that will have both peaceful and military implications. I need
hardly tell you that this is a great step forward for Britain, and
indeed I may say, for the whole world. Now, have you got any questions?
<br>
STONE: Roy Stone, New York Sketch. <br>
SUMMER: Fire away. <br>
STONE: Sir, doesn't this put a great deal of power into the hands of
whoever operates WOTAN? <br>
SUMMER: No one operates WOTAN. WOTAN operates itself. The computer is
merely a brain which thinks logically without any political or private
ends. It is pure thought. It makes calculations, it supplies only the
truth. It has no imaginative powers. <br>
STONE: Is there no way of fixing it so it can give the wrong answers? <br>
SUMMER: There would be no point. Now don't forget that a computer like
WOTAN is not a human being. <br>
STONE: Oh, but surely, sir <br>
SUMMER: It has no reason to suppress the truth, it has no emotions. It
is our soul. <br>
STONE: It seems to me by the way you're talking, sir, that this machine
can think for itself like a human being. <br>
SUMMER: It can. Only much more accurately. <br>
STONE: But sir, I mean, isn't this kinda risky? I mean, suppose it
decides it can do without people, what then? <br>
SUMMER: I hardly think it'll come to that. I'm sure that Professor
Brett and his team will have the machine well under control. <br>
(Summer sits down and turns to his associate.) <br>
SUMMER: Where the devil is Brett? <br>
KRIMPTON: He should have met me here an hour ago. <br>

Brett. I'm sure he'll be along in a moment or two if you will just bear

BRETT: Have you been here all day, Major? <br>

BRETT: Are you sure that this building's properly screened? <br>
GREEN: If you have any complaints <br>
BRETT: I have. There's someone in this part of the building. <br>

security check on this section of the tower day and night. <br>
BRETT: Are you sure? <br>
GREEN: Positive. <br>
BRETT: It's funny. I've had a feeling all day of someone there. Someone
listening to me, watching me. <br>

GREEN: There's only the two of us in this part of the tower, sir. <br>

Earth's got into him this evening? His manner was very odd. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, very odd, very odd indeed. Perhaps he's overworking. Who
was that little man, Krimpton? <br>
SUMMER: Oh, electronics fellow. One of our top men. Come to think of
it, electronics. Perhaps there is something wrong with WOTAN and he
didn't want to let it out? That would explain it, wouldn't it? Look,

DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Do you remember me, Major Green? <br>
GREEN: No. I don't. I'm afraid I don't remember anything. Where am I?
What is this place? <br>
SUMMER: You don't remember anything? <br>
GREEN: No. <br>
SUMMER: Do you remember this machine? <br>
GREEN: Good heavens, what on Earth is this thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you'll have to have him removed, gentlemen. He may
need medical attention. <br>
SUMMER: All right, Sergeant. <br>
SERGEANT: Sir. <br>
CAPTAIN: All right, you two men go with him. <br>
SERGEANT: This way, sir. <br>
(Green is led away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SUMMER: Look, Doctor, how do you know he's telling the truth? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, of course he is. He remembers nothing since he was taken
over by Brett's computer system. <br>
MINISTER: You seem very positive about that, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. <br>
SUMMER: Well if Brett's at the root of this business, then the sooner
we get in the GPO tower, the better. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you intend to do there, sir? <br>
SUMMER: Well, get hold of Brett and get him out of it. <br>
DOCTOR: That is very dangerous, Sir Charles. And if I may say so, your
strong arm methods have already got us into plenty of trouble. <br>

Polly, Doctor, they could've transferred her to help at any one of
their premises. <br>

anything, shall we? <br>

Charles receives a telephone update.) <br>
SUMMER: Where? Battersea? I see. Well, have you had any reports in yet?
Good heavens, it's appalling. Well you stay and get the phone. I'll be
back to you. The second machine is approaching the Battersea power
station and it's creating absolute havoc. Well, we've tried the army.
What else is there? <br>
MINISTER: Yeah. Haven't you anything you can suggest, Doctor? This is
urgent. <br>
DOCTOR: Somehow we've got to get a hold of that machine. <br>
MINISTER: Get hold of it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and I think our only one chance is to paralyse the nervous
system of that mechanism. Yes, and if I remember rightly, it will be
electromagnetically controlled. Yes, in other words, gentlemen, we've
got to capture it! </font></p>

SUMMER: Won't that be dangerous? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid that we have no choice, gentlemen. <br>

I'm afraid I don't understand it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, allow me to illustrate, Sir Charles. Now, to set up a
magnetic field I want a four square box formed by four cables. <br>
SUMMER: But the machine will never cross the first cable. <br>
DOCTOR: Well exactly! Therefore, we must prepare these three first and
then, when the machine has approached and appeared in that position we
connect the fourth cable and switch on. <br>
SUMMER: But how do you connect the fourth cable? <br>
DOCTOR: I shall connect the cable myself. <br>

killed. <br>

purpose of this machine. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, you could say that, of course, yes. I hope it will carry
out a special programme that I've fed into it. <br>

Would you mind just standing back for a moment? Now, my dear Ben, just
carry out what I've asked you to do. <br>

BEN: But how are you going to use it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it all started at that Tower. <br>
BEN: What, the Post Office Tower? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, in Brett's office. And I think it will probably end there.
<br>
BEN: Yeah, what about Polly? I think she must have gone back there. <br>
