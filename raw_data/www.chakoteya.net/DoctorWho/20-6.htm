<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Southern England, early 13th century. In a
nobleman's hall a feast it taking place. A small jester entertains
while music is provided on a lute. Suddenly a sullen man wearing a
crown slams his goblet down on the top table.) <br>
JOHN: Enough! <br>
(The lute player stops, stands and bows.) <br>
JOHN: This is a poor welcome, my lord. <br>
RANULF: But sire <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934783/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Frank
Windsor</a>.) <br>
JOHN: Hear us. We have come to ask but a pittance. Three marks per
knight's fee. You obstruct the Crusade, my lord, with your parsimony. <br>
RANULF: But your Majesty already has my whole fortune willingly given
but six month's since. There is no more. My coffers are empty. <br>
JOHN: Your words are more generous than your purse, Lord Ranulf. If you
speak truth, if we have your whole fortune, you insult us. <br>
(The King's Champion, a burly chap with lots of red hair, gets up and
throws a gauntlet onto the floor. He speaks with a French accent.) <br>
GILLES: You insult the King. <br>
RANULF: Your Majesty, I <br>
GILLES: You insult the King. <br>
(A young man dashes forward to pick up the gauntlet first.) <br>
GILLES: Are you so craven? <br>
HUGH: My father is of ill-health, Sir Gilles. <br>
ISABELLA: Hugh! <br>
HUGH: I pick up your gage. <br>
(Hugh tries to slap Sir Gilles across the face with the gauntlet, but
his arm is held firm.) <br>
RANULF: I beg your Majesty. Take my lands, my goods, my chattels, even
the robes I stand in, but spare me my surviving son. <br>
HUGH: Father, do not dishonour me. <br>
RANULF: My son, your Majesty. <br>
JOHN: We shall see, my lord, if your fealty is as slender as your
fortune. Your son shall meet our champion on the morrow. We shall
retire and dream sweet dreams. We bid you goodnight. <br>
RANULF: Goodnight, sire. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The tents are set up outside Bodiam Castle in
Sussex for the fight, and it has drawn a fair crowd.) <br>
SOLDIER: Make way for the King. <br>
(King John takes his position on the dais amongst the nobles. Sir
Gilles and Hugh are mounted on their chargers and don helmets before
taking their lances and moving into position. The King gives the signal
and the two knights charge down the lists at each other. The first pass
is indecisive so they go again. Then the Tardis materialises, spooking
the horses.) <br>
JOHN: Ah, friends, friends, calm yourselves. There's no cause for
alarm. </font></p>

DOCTOR: So it seems. <br>
TURLOUGH: You didn't set the coordinates for here by any chance? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
TEGAN: When is it? <br>
DOCTOR: March the fourth, 1215. <br>
TEGAN: Is it England? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. <br>
TEGAN: Could this be a Black Guardian trap? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so, but something certainly isn't right. <br>
TEGAN: You're not going out there? <br>
DOCTOR: Just for a moment. <br>
(The Doctor hands Tegan a thick coat to put over her multi-coloured
long-sleeved outfit.) <br>
TEGAN: That man looks distinctly unfriendly. <br>
DOCTOR: So he does. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The crowd gasp and take a step back as the Doctor
comes out of the Tardis.) <br>
GILLES: My liege, I have no need of aid from Lucifer. <br>
DOCTOR: Lucifer? <br>
TEGAN: Is that the King? <br>
DOCTOR: Without a doubt. <br>
JOHN: Damn you cringing caitiffs. We tell you there's naught to fear.
Do our demons come to visit us? Bid them attend us. <br>
DOCTOR: Demons? Very odd indeed. <br>
TEGAN: Makes a nice change for you not to take everything in your
stride, I must say. <br>
DOCTOR: Must you? <br>
TEGAN: Too right. <br>
DOCTOR: He even seems pleased to see us. A king welcoming demons. <br>
TEGAN: Which king? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Tegan. 1215? King John, of course. <br>
TEGAN: The one who lost something in the Wash? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you could put it like that. This particular shirt turned
out to be the Crown Jewels, but that's next year. We're still three
months away from Magna Carta. <br>
(Two of the King's knights come to escort the Doctor, Turlough and
Tegan to the King.) <br>
JOHN: Welcome, our demons. Name yourselves. Can this be Lilith? <br>
DOCTOR: Her name is Tegan, your Majesty. This is Turlough, and I am the
Doctor. We are not demons. <br>
JOHN: You're too modest, Lord Doctor. Come, rejoice with us in a trial
by combat. Come, make way for our demons. Let them be seated by us. <br>
(Ranulf and Isabella, and another man, give up their places. The
knights replace their helms and charge down the lists again. Sir
Gilles's lance catches Hugh square in the shield and knocks him to the
ground. Whilst Hugh is still winded, Estram dismounts and raises his
sword to kill Hugh.) <br>
RANULF: Sire! <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty, if I may make so bold. <br>
JOHN: Hold! Lord Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: If this is trial by combat, your Majesty, there's clearly a
victor and a vanquished. Must blood be shed? <br>
JOHN: We take your counsel, O demon. Spare him. <br>
HUGH: Come, sir, despatch. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Isabella goes to console her son. Sir Gilles
listens from behind a pillar.) <br>
HUGH: I am dishonoured. <br>
DOCTOR: You are alive, my friend. <br>
HUGH: No friend to you. <br>
(Hugh storms out.) <br>
RANULF: Heed him not, whoever you are. I am grateful. You are welcome
at Fitzwilliam Castle. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
RANULF: Soon we shall sit at meat. Betimes you may wish to withdraw.
Conduct my guests to their chamber. </font></p>

DOCTOR: By eating lots of food. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Thank you. Where's Turlough? <br>
TEGAN: He stopped to look at something. Look at the size of that bed! <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Another way of keeping warm. <br>
TEGAN: What are we doing here, anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: We were invited for a meal. <br>
TEGAN: You know what I mean. <br>
(The Doctor takes a large skin from the bed.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here, put this around you. <br>
TEGAN: How long are you planning to stay? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know, it's just sunk in. March the fourth, 1215. <br>
TEGAN: So? <br>
DOCTOR: There's something very wrong here. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: The King takes the oath today. <br>
TEGAN: What oath? <br>
DOCTOR: To take the cross as a Crusader. But he did that in London. <br>
TEGAN: Who says? <br>
DOCTOR: Your history books. <br>
TEGAN: Perhaps they got that bit wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, too well documented. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, who cares? <br>
DOCTOR: I care. <br>
TEGAN: All I care about is getting back to the Tardis, where it's nice
and warm. No wonder they forced him to sign Magna Carta. Bet there was
something in it about underheated housing. <br>
DOCTOR: He wasn't. <br>
TEGAN: Wasn't what? <br>
DOCTOR: Forced into signing Magna Carta. He was as much for it as
anyone. <br>
TEGAN: Now look, Doctor, I know my history. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HUGH: I would know who or what you are. <br>

noblewoman.) <br>
ISABELLA: He is proud, my Lord. He will never forgive you. <br>
RANULF: And you? <br>
ISABELLA: With all my heart. But he is your son. He is as proud as you.
<br>
RANULF: Time heals. But at the present, my concern is for the King. Why
is he so changed? And who are these beings he calls demons? <br>
GILLES: My Lord. <br>
RANULF: What now? <br>
GILLES: I must ask the Lady Isabella to accompany me. <br>
RANULF: To what end? <br>
GILLES: Your lady is to be held in custody. <br>
RANULF: What! <br>
GILLES: To be held in custody against your continued good behaviour
toward our sovereign lord, the Kind. <br>
RANULF: On whose authority. <br>
GILLES: Of that of the King. <br>
RANULF: The King is a guest in my house. He would not use me thus. <br>
GILLES: He would and does, my Lord. <br>
RANULF: We shall see. <br>
GILLES: Be not rash, my Lord. The King is resting. He sends word to not
preserve pitchers. A new cider will be provided when he dines. <br>
RANULF: You dare to <br>
ISABELLA: Be not provoked, my Lord. The King shall lack no comfort
while within these walls. <br>
GILLES: My Lady. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Turlough is held by two guards.) <br>
HUGH: Speak. <br>
TURLOUGH: I've nothing to hide. I'll tell you anything you want to
know. <br>
HUGH: But you speak nothing but madness. <br>
TURLOUGH: I've told you who I am and where I come from. What more do
you want? <br>
HUGH: Are you the King's man like my father? <br>
TURLOUGH: I am nobody's man. <br>
HUGH: Then what do you here? <br>
TURLOUGH: I came with the Doctor. <br>
HUGH: And what is this Doctor's purpose? <br>
TURLOUGH: I don't know. <br>
HUGH: Well, perhaps I can loosen your tongue. <br>
(Hugh opens the smaller of two iron maidens.) <br>
TURLOUGH: There really is no need for any of this. <br>
HUGH: Fill her! <br>
(The sound of footsteps.) <br>
HUGH: Hold. <br>
(Isabella enters.) <br>
HUGH: Mother! <br>
GILLES: Seize them! <br>
(Hugh tries to defend his mother, but Sir Gilles easily disarms him.) <br>
GILLES: Twice in one day. It is most embarrassing. <br>
HUGH: You'd best kill me now, for if you do not, I will most assuredly
kill you. <br>
GILLES: Why is youth given to such extravagance? <br>
(Sir Gilles throws Hugh across the room.) <br>
GILLES: It appears, my Lady, you will not be without companionship.
Secure them! And then we will examine this demon's blue engine. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Guest chamber]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Are you saying King John was a good man? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, given the times he lives in, yes. But don't take my word
for it. You'll be able to judge for yourself. Nobody forced Magna Carta
from him. He could have crushed that rebellion as easily as that. <br>
(The Doctor snaps his fingers. Ranulf enters, sword drawn.) <br>
RANULF: What have you demons made of the King? He is bewitched. First
he takes my whole fortune, and now he has made my lady a hostage. How
can he question my loyalty? There is none more loyal than I. <br>
DOCTOR: We are not demons and we've done no harm to the King, or to
anyone. Nor do we intend any. <br>
RANULF: Whence come you? <br>
DOCTOR: From an outer province. <br>
RANULF: And this strange attire? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Please believe that we are friends. If you're in
trouble, I would like to help if I can. <br>
(Ranulf sheaths his sword and turns to his guards.) <br>
RANULF: Leave us, and fetch warm vestments. <br>
(The guards obey.) <br>
RANULF: You were three. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, we seem to have mislaid Turlough. How long has the
King been here? <br>
RANULF: Since yesterday. He is not himself. He's not as I know him. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, could he be ill? <br>
RANULF: In rude health. He rode from London yesterday, and then to a
stag hunt to bring down the only kill. <br>
DOCTOR: This Sir Gilles. <br>
RANULF: I like not this man. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can't say I care for him much myself. A French knight.
Is he the only Frenchman with the King? <br>
RANULF: I know not. He has never favoured Frenchmen before this, even
renegades from the King of France. <br>
DOCTOR: Could Sir Gilles be bringing some pressure, some influence on
the King? <br>
RANULF: The King is influenced by none. The King I know is resolute and
firm of purpose. <br>
DOCTOR: When does he return to London? <br>
RANULF: I know not, and no word from the city. My cousin was summoned
there by the King a week since, and he's not returned. Why? And why no
word concerning him? <br>
DOCTOR: Your cousin was summoned to London? <br>
RANULF: Aye, to take the Crusader's oath. <br>
DOCTOR: Today, March the fourth. <br>
RANULF: What say you, my Lord Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What if your guest was not the King? <br>
RANULF: Not the King? Then who? <br>
DOCTOR: An imposter. <br>
RANULF: I have known and served my sovereign lord for many years. No
imposter could be so like. <br>
DOCTOR: Be vigilant, my Lord. I suspect things are not what they seem. <br>
RANULF: You are a sorcerer. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, and I ask you to trust me, please. <br>
TEGAN: You can trust us. <br>
RANULF: You will join my household at meat. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, we would be delighted. <br>
RANULF: When it pleases you. <br>
(Sir Gilles supervises the Tardis being carted into the castle. A large
cloak has been provided for Tegan.) <br>
DOCTOR: Warmer? <br>
TEGAN: Yes. Shouldn't we find out what's happened to Turlough? <br>
DOCTOR: We will. <br>
TEGAN: I don't feel safe here. <br>
DOCTOR: A while longer, then we'll go. </font></p>

his men.) <br>
GILLES: Name yourself, Sir Knight. <br>
GEOFFREY: Geoffrey de Lacy, cousin to Ranulf Fitzwilliam. And your
name? <br>
GILLES: Gilles Estram, King's Champion. <br>
GEOFFREY: Why then are you not with the King? <br>
GILLES: I am. <br>
GEOFFREY: How can that be, since the King is in London? <br>
GILLES: Non, the King is here. <br>
GEOFFREY: Borne on eagle's wings? I left the King in the Tower this
morning. <br>

Isabella and Hugh, at Ranulf's left hand.) <br>

ISABELLA: Can you not help us? <br>
TURLOUGH: I wish I could. <br>
HUGH: Can you not call on Hell? <br>
TURLOUGH: I could, but then so could you, with a better chance of
success, I fancy. <br>
(Four guards enter and carry away the smaller iron maiden.) <br>
TURLOUGH: I do hope they've found a better use for it. <br>
ISABELLA: A better use? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Great hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: If he's not the King, who is he and why? <br>
TEGAN: Do you seriously expect me to answer that? <br>
DOCTOR: Why didn't he react like everybody else? Why wasn't he scared?
And why are we his demons? <br>
TEGAN: Could he be the Devil? I only said could. <br>
(The jester gets a round of applause.) <br>
JOHN: The lutes. Let us have the lutes. <br>
(The lute player hands his instrument to the King, who plays it very
well.) <br>
JOHN: (singing) We sing in praise of total war, against the Saracen we
abhor. To free the tomb of Christ our lord, we'll put the known world
to the sword. There is no glory greater than to serve with gold the Son
of Man. No riches here on Earth shall see, no scutage in eternity. <br>
GILLES: And now, sire, for some additional entertainment. <br>
(The iron maiden is carried in.) <br>
JOHN: Bravo, our champion. And who is to delight in her embrace? <br>
(Geoffrey is escorted in.) <br>
RANULF: Geoffrey! Sire, this is my cousin Geoffrey de Lacy, a loyal
knight. You summoned him to London but a week since to take the
Crusader's oath. <br>
JOHN: So we did, indeed we did. And he has seen fit to disobey that
summons. <br>
GEOFFREY: Not so. I left your Majesty in London four hours since. You
must remember. <br>
JOHN: Must? <br>
GILLES: You lie. The King has been here since yesterday. Now let the
maiden reward such mendacity. Prepare her. <br>
RANULF: Sire, be merciful, I beg you. <br>
GILLES: Your cousin is guilty of lèse majesté, my Lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty. <br>
JOHN: What? Our demon, you too would beg for mercy. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, indeed no, sire, but surely such a fate is too mild. Would
not boiling in oil be a more fitting end? <br>
JOHN: Ha! It must be a decade, our champion, since we boiled in oil. We
accept your counsel, O demon. <br>
DOCTOR: I thank your Majesty, but I was not suggesting alternative
retribution. My interruption was provoked by shock. <br>
JOHN: Shock? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I was quite shocked at Sir Gilles' monstrous lack of good
taste. <br>
GILLES: Who dares to question my good taste? <br>
DOCTOR: In my view, it is the worst possible taste to even think about
following the King's quite remarkable performance. One just can't
follow that. <br>
GILLES: I am insulted! <br>
(Sir Gilles hits the Doctor with his gauntlet. The Doctor removes his
jacket.) <br>
TEGAN: Are you mad? <br>
RANULF: He is said to be the best swordsman in France. <br>
DOCTOR: Fortunately, we are in England. May I? <br>
(Ranulf hands the Doctor his sword.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. I hope I don't disgrace it. In case of accidents <br>
TEGAN: Doctor, don't do it. <br>
DOCTOR: In case of accidents, find Turlough. <br>
JOHN: Well, our Champion and our demon. Have a care, Sir Gilles. Has
our demon mortal life to lose? <br>
GILLES: I fear no hellhound. <br>
JOHN: Then set to. <br>
(Sir Gilles mostly lunges, the Doctor mostly parries and dodges. They
take the fight up the stairs and back down into the hall. One of Sir
Gilles' thrusts comes very close to the King. Finally, the Doctor gets
to step on the Champion's sword, pulling it out of his hand.) <br>
JOHN: Bravo, our demon. <br>
(Gilles pulls out his tissue compressor eliminator and his face changes
from that of Estram to Master.) <br>
DOCTOR: You escaped from Xeriphas. <br>

TEGAN: Tissue compression eliminator. <br>
MASTER: You've always been my greatest stimulation, my dear Doctor, but
now you inspire me. <br>
(Tegan throws a knife at the Master, but he catches it without even
looking.) <br>
MASTER: Your first slip, my dear Doctor. Would you care to make a
second? <br>
(The Master holds out both the TCE and the knife hilt to the Doctor. He
snatches the TCE.) <br>
MASTER: And now a third. This is useless in your hands. You have moral
scruples. <br>
JOHN: Come, what is this discourse? Consummate the victory. <br>
(The Master drops the knife.) <br>
MASTER: Come, kill me. Thwart my little game. <br>
JOHN: Kill him. <br>
DOCTOR: It is sufficient, your Majesty, that your Champion is disarmed.
<br>
JOHN: Not for us. In sooth, this is but a puny demon that has no
stomach for it. So be it. Let the Maiden embrace the vanquished. <br>
MASTER: Your Majesty, no! Have mercy! I beg you, no! <br>
(The Master is hustled into the Iron Maiden by a couple of guards.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sire, I must intercede. As victor, I beg you to be merciful. <br>
JOHN: We are not merciful, our demon. <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty! <br>
JOHN: Hold! We give you the choice, our demon. The Maiden shall embrace
this snivelling wretch, or Sir Geoffrey. Choose, our demon. Come, the
lady waits, impatient to lavish her warm favours. Come, our demon. <br>

of the Iron Maiden is closed and locked. Then it dematerialises.) <br>

HUGH: Another demon. <br>

the King from that demon that has bewitched him. Gaoler! Open, good
fellow. The King is in danger. <br>
ISABELLA: Who are you? <br>
MASTER: I am the Master. <br>
(The gaoler enters.) <br>
MASTER: Release your lord and lady. <br>
ISABELLA: Do as you are bidden! <br>
MASTER: I am the sworn enemy of that demon who calls himself the
Doctor, who has come to defame the King and bring ill-repute to him. <br>
TURLOUGH: That's not true! <br>
ISABELLA: Defame the King? Why should he? <br>
MASTER: To set the Barons of Britain against him, to provoke a great
rebellion and topple him from the throne. <br>
ISABELLA: Why? <br>
MASTER: To serve the devilish Doctor's own purpose. <br>
TURLOUGH: No, don't listen to him. <br>
MASTER: No, fellow, leave him. He serves the Doctor. <br>
TURLOUGH: Don't listen to him, please. He is the evil one. <br>

role shall be to arrest that man. Arrest Sir Geoffrey de Lacy. <br>

RANULF: There is. <br>

DOCTOR: There is no Sir Gilles. He is the Master in disguise. Now, you
could call him a demon. Sir Geoffrey, you are no longer a prisoner.
Release him. <br>
GEOFFREY: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: A friend, who wants to help. The Master has set up an imposter
as King John of England. <br>
TEGAN: What for? <br>
DOCTOR: To change the course of history. <br>
TEGAN: What possible satisfaction can that give him? <br>
DOCTOR: He wants to rob the world of Magna Carta. Small time villainy
by his standards, but nevertheless something I intend to stop if at all
possible. <br>
GEOFFREY: But why do you serve this imposter king? <br>
DOCTOR: To gain time, and access to this. <br>
(The Doctor turns on the TCE and puts it either inside or behind the
Maiden, I'm not sure which.) <br>
DOCTOR: You know the true king? <br>

yesterday? <br>

TEGAN: Look, let's all get out of here while we've still got the
chance. <br>
DOCTOR: No, we must bring the imposter with us. <br>
TEGAN: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: To expose the Master's plan. Now, come along. (to gaoler) If
you so much as touch this, something very nasty will happen to you. <br>

earlier invader of Xeriphas, and instrumental in my escape from that
