KELLY: Brent? <br>
BRENT: Yes, Miss Kelly? <br>
KELLY: Why is there a delay at Moon Control? <br>
BRENT: There's some mix up with the Moscow shipment. It seems to have
landed up in Canberra. <br>

across the floor swinging his briefcase.) <br>
OSGOOD: Good morning, Gia. <br>
KELLY: Morning. Just as well you've arrived. <br>
OSGOOD: Why, what's up? <br>
KELLY: The sooner you take over from Fewsham on Moon Control, the
better. <br>
OSGOOD: Oh, not again! <br>
KELLY: All T-Mat consignments are five minutes behind schedule. <br>
OSGOOD: What? <br>
KELLY: Fewsham routed a large Moscow consignment through to Canberra. <br>
OSGOOD: Oh, he's a lunatic. <br>
KELLY: You should never have recommended him for an Assistant
Controller's job in the first place. <br>
OSGOOD: Yes, I know now, but I thought he deserved a break. <br>
KELLY: Sentimental. He'll do something really disastrous one day and
you'll have to answer for it. <br>
OSGOOD: So, I'll go and work in a synthetics factory. <br>
KELLY: It's your career. <br>
OSGOOD: So it is. Hey, have you got a T-Mat cubicle ready for me? <br>
KELLY: Yes. Number six. <br>
OSGOOD: See you later. <br>
(Osgood steps into another cubicle.) <br>
KELLY: Prepare lunar cubicle number six for transport to Moon Control. <br>
BRENT: Ready and waiting. <br>
(Osgood blows Kelly a kiss.) <br>
KELLY: Activate. <br>
(Osgood vanishes.) <br>
BRENT: It's lucky he got here before your man arrived. <br>
KELLY: Yes, he's late. Keep a public T-Mat cubicle open for him. <br>
BRENT: Right. Local cubicle two holding open. <br>
KELLY: Report Moonbase situation please. <br>

RADNOR: Morning, Brent. <br>
BRENT: Morning, sir.&nbsp;<br>
RADNOR: Good morning, Gia. All functioning well? <br>
KELLY: Of course, Commander Radnor. <br>
RADNOR: In your case, Miss Kelly, efficiency and charm go hand in hand.
<br>
KELLY: I try to keep things running smoothly. <br>
RADNOR: Nothing ever goes wrong while you're on duty. <br>
KELLY: I don't allow it. <br>

Fewsham, but that's no excuse for this kind of slip-up! <br>
FEWSHAM: They weren't a major hold ups, just a few minutes. <br>
OSGOOD: Kelly was going mad back on Earth Control. <br>
FEWSHAM: She would. <br>
OSGOOD: Look, I'm sorry, Fewsham, but it's my head in the noose as
well, you know. <br>
FEWSHAM: I know, I'm sorry. <br>
OSGOOD: Oh, all right. All right, go on. You'd better get back to
Earth. <br>
(Fewsham goes to a cubicle, but an alarm sounds.) <br>
OSGOOD: Now what? <br>
FEWSHAM: The outer door airlocks. <br>
OSGOOD: Who's there? <br>
FEWSHAM: No one. <br>
OSGOOD: Then how come the airlocks are in use? <br>
(A man screams just outside the control room. Osgood and Fewsham open
the doors and he falls into their arms.) <br>
OSGOOD: Phipps! What is it, man? What's happened? Come on, man! <br>
(Another scream and two more men run in.) <br>
LOCKE: Close the doors, we've got to keep <br>

OSGOOD: Don't move, anybody. Don't do anything. Harvey, don't! <br>

PHIPPS: Don't do it, sir. <br>
SLAAR: Silence. <br>
OSGOOD: There's a certain element of risk. <br>
SLAAR: You are wasting time. <br>
(Osgood operates some switches under the video screen. Smoke starts
pouring out of the sides.) <br>
SLAAR: What is happening? <br>
OSGOOD: I'm afraid there has been a fault. The circuit's overloaded.
Very unfortunate. <br>
SLAAR: You have deliberately sabotaged this apparatus. Kill him. <br>

ZOE: Doctor, if we've landed, where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: That is what I'm trying to find out, Zoe. <br>
(The scanner picks up - ) <br>
ZOE: A rocket? <br>
JAMIE: Hey, we're just hanging in space. <br>
DOCTOR: We can't be. <br>
ZOE: Well, let's try and find a star we know. <br>
(The scanner image swings round to a CCCP space suit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah there we are. What in heavens name? <br>
JAMIE: Hey, what's he up to? <br>
ZOE: He's trying to climb aboard. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a minute, just a minute. Oh this control is. There we are.
Now that, that's an ion-jet rocket of the twenty first century, but,
this helmet, if I can. There we are. That's not nearly so
sophisticated. It's certainly not later than 1960. <br>
JAMIE: Well, those letters on his helmet? <br>
ZOE: C C C P. <br>
JAMIE: Aye. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course! <br>
JAMIE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Just a minute. <br>
(The Doctor gets the scanner to turn in the opposite direction, and
reveals an old document with backwards writing on it.)&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that explains it. <br>
ZOE: Oh Doctor, what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well it's a flying machine, designed by a gentleman by the
name of Leonardo Da Vinci in about 1500. <br>
JAMIE: Well, what's it doing up here? <br>
ZOE: Doctor, where are we? <br>
JAMIE: Aye. <br>
DOCTOR: We're in a museum! <br>
JAMIE: A what? <br>
DOCTOR: A space museum! Look, there you are. <br>
(Wright Brothers airplane, capsule with an astronaut taking a tethered
space walk, Montgolfier's balloon) <br>
DOCTOR: A balloon. <br>
(A Spitfire, a HOTOL style American Airlines plane.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's a transport plane. And, now those initials, they stand
for Russia. That's Gagarin, the first Earthman in space. Look. <br>
(A rocket launch, TravelMat Relay over an image of the Moon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's have a look round, shall we? <br>
(Jamie and Zoe Leave the Tardis. The Doctor turns back for his jacket.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Just a minute. Wait for me.

DOCTOR: Now, Zoe. <br>
(There is a chime.) <br>
JAMIE: What's that? <br>
(A screen drops down on the wall behind them, and an information video
plays.) <br>
MAN [OC]: Travel Mat is the ultimate form of travel. Control centre of
the present system is the Moon, serving receptions at all major cities
on the Earth. Travel Mat provides an instantaneous means of public
travel, transports raw materials and vital food supplies to all parts
of the world. <br>
JAMIE: Travel Mat? It sounds like a flying carpet. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, I'm trying to listen.&nbsp;<br>
MAN [OC]: Travel Mat supersedes all conventional forms of transport.
Using the principle of dematerialisation at the point of departure, and
rematerialisation at the point of arrival in special cubicles,
departure and arrival are almost instantaneous. <br>
ZOE: Faster than light. <br>
MAN [OC]: Although the system is still in its early stages, it
completely automated and foolproof against power failure. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, well, we have our own system, thank you, only it isn't
foolproof. <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think that's just a tiny bit <br>
(The Doctor turns and raises his hands in surrender to the weapon
pointed at him. Jamie and Zoe do likewise.)

would do well to co-operate. <br>
FEWSHAM: Killing him didn't do you any good. <br>
SLAAR: But you will do as I ask. <br>
FEWSHAM: There is nothing I can do! <br>
SLAAR: You do not want to die? <br>
FEWSHAM: Look, I'm not that good enough a technician. It needs an
expert. <br>
SLAAR: But you are second in command here. <br>
FEWSHAM: Yes, but <br>
SLAAR: Then you must have certain abilities. You must know what needs
to be done. <br>
FEWSHAM: In theory, yes. <br>
SLAAR: Then you will do it. <br>
PHIPPS: He'll only make it worse. <br>
SLAAR: What is their status here? <br>
FEWSHAM: Maintenance. Second class technicians. <br>
LOCKE: There's only one person who can really put things to rights, and
she's at Earth Control. <br>
PHIPPS: Without her, it just can't be done. <br>
SLAAR: Who is this specialist? <br>
FEWSHAM: Miss Kelly, technical coordinator. But there's no way to reach
her. T-Mat is not working. <br>
SLAAR: But you have a video link. <br>
FEWSHAM: Yes, but Osgood wrecked that too. <br>
SLAAR: So, there is no means to communicate with Earth? <br>
PHIPPS: No, you've cut us off completely. <br>
SLAAR: In that case, you are useless. You will all be destroyed. <br>
FEWSHAM: No, there's the emergency T-Mat link! It only operates from
here to Earth. <br>
SLAAR: Then you will activate the apparatus. At once. <br>
(Fewsham hurries to the controls.) <br>
FEWSHAM: It's damaged, too! <br>
SLAAR: These technicians will help you repair it. <br>
PHIPPS: We won't help you. Neither will he. <br>
SLAAR: Then he will die. You will start work at once. There will be a
guard at the door. When I return you will have the T-mat link ready for
operation. <br>
(Slaar, who we have not yet seen, leaves.) <br>
PHIPPS: Don't be such a fool, Fewsham. If we repair the emergency link
these creatures can travel to Earth! <br>
FEWSHAM: What about us? <br>
PHIPPS: Do you think that will make any difference in the end? As soon
as he gets what he wants out of us, we'll mean nothing to him. <br>
FEWSHAM: If we co-operate there's still a chance. <br>
PHIPPS: Osgood didn't take it. <br>
FEWSHAM: You saw! Do you think I want to die like that? I want to live!

of a reason? <br>
BRENT: Every link has been double-checked. This end is functioning
normally. <br>

don't answer our call. <br>
KELLY: Where's Commander Radnor? <br>
BRENT: Not back from the Intercity Council meeting yet. <br>
KELLY: He'll expect a full report. <br>
BRENT: Well, there it is. We've even checked the computer. <br>

RADNOR: Have you located the cause of the breakdown? <br>
KELLY: This end is absolutely clear. <br>
RADNOR: That isn't what I want to know. <br>
KELLY: We cannot trace the fault. <br>
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! I have senior government officials hounding me.
They expect a more informative answer, and so do I. <br>
KELLY: There isn't one. The trouble is at Moonbase. <br>
RADNOR: Why can't you deal with it? <br>
KELLY: We can't get there. <br>
BRENT: We can't even talk to them. <br>
RADNOR: Do you mean to tell me that there's no other way of contacting
them? <br>
BRENT: No. <br>
KELLY: Only by rocket. <br>
RADNOR: That could be our only answer. <br>
BRENT: But the only place you'll find a rocket is in a museum. <br>
RADNOR: Exactly. <br>
KELLY: And even if there was one that could be made operational,
there's no-one that could control such a project. <br>

private workshop? <br>
DOCTOR: Now just listen, there really is no need for all these
histrionics. We are perfectly harmless. <br>
ELDRED: How did you even get in here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, the usual way. We just materialised. <br>
ELDRED: The T-Mat cubicle always gives automatic warnings, but it
didn't this time. <br>
ZOE: Well that's not our fault, is it? <br>
ELDRED: Why did you come? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this is a museum. <br>
ELDRED: The museum is (sees the Tardis) What on Earth's that? It's a
twentieth century Police Box, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, yes, in a way. <br>
ELDRED: Well, how did a thing like that get in my museum? <br>
ZOE: Oh, well you could say it was a form of space ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Zoe, I think we do owe this gentleman an apology. We really are
most interested in the museum, Mister?&nbsp;<br>
ELDRED: Eldred, Professor Eldred. Look, the museum is closed to the
general public. You've obviously made a mistake. Perhaps you'd be good
enough to leave. <br>
JAMIE: Are you in charge of this place? <br>
ELDRED: I own it. That is why I have the right to ask you to leave. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but there's no need to threaten us, you know. <br>
ELDRED: Trespassers are not welcome. Will you please go! <br>
ZOE: We're not trespassers. We're very interested. <br>
ELDRED: Interested? In Professor Eldred and his antiquated machines?
Come for a good laugh, I suppose, like the rest of them. <br>
DOCTOR: Laugh? You mean people laugh at all this? Why, it's a
magnificent exhibition. <br>
ELDRED: We've had enough souvenir hunters, too! <br>
JAMIE: Now, we're not thieves, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: No, of course not. We haven't come to take anything. We
genuinely are interested in space travel. Why, especially a thing like
this. This is superb. <br>
ELDRED: Yes, magnificent. It was to have been the vehicle to take man
beyond the moon. T-Mat put an end to all that. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean this model's been abandoned? But it's speed and
stability concept alone, it's a tremendous advance in rocket design. <br>
ELDRED: Exactly! Exactly! Here, let me show it to you. Let me show it
to you. <br>
(Eldred puts down his gun and helps the Doctor with the ion jet rocket
model.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'll give you an hand, here we are. Oh yes, this is superb. My
word. <br>
ELDRED: And the secret, the real breakthrough, was a compact generator
of enormous power. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And these must be the secondary electrode accelerators. <br>
ELDRED: Yes. You see it beat the problem of the neutral caesium ions.
And incidentally, it magnified the g-thrust to fantastic
proportions!&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: That was awkward. What did you do about that?&nbsp;<br>
ELDRED: Well, I'll show you. Come with me, I'll show you. Look. <br>
(Eldred and the Doctor go to the back of the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: What have we go here? Ah, blueprints! <br>
JAMIE: Look at them, like a couple of kids. <br>
ZOE: Yes. You can tell he's almost in love with that rocket. <br>
JAMIE: Shush! <br>
ELDRED: That's not surprising. I designed it. I've been in rocketry all
my life. My father engineered the first lunar passenger module, and I
travelled on the last trip back to Earth. Before it all finished. <br>
ZOE: Before all what finished? <br>
ELDRED: Space travel. <br>
ZOE: But if the rocket was so good, why did you stop at the moon? <br>
JAMIE: Aye, why end there? <br>
ELDRED: Because of T-Mat. T-Mat, the ultimate in travel. With about as
much sense of adventure as a synthetic carbohydrates factory. <br>
DOCTOR: But surely rockets would still be useful as an auxiliary means
of transport, wouldn't they? Besides, how would man get beyond the
moon? <br>
ELDRED: Nobody cares any more about exploring space. Life made. Well,
it was made too easy by T-Mat. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. So you lost government backing? <br>
ELDRED: The project was abandoned, except by me.

<br>
ELDRED: Why? You've done without a chat for a good many years. <br>
RADNOR: Old times. Friendships don't die. <br>
ELDRED: Our friendship ended the day that you walked out of my
laboratory and joined the government administration on T-Mat! <br>
RADNOR: Different men, different careers, Daniel. <br>
ELDRED: Yes, but you happened to know which career was going to be
financed by government funds. <br>
RADNOR: But you could have come over with me. We asked you to join us. <br>
ELDRED: Yes, and worked as Miss Kelly's assistant perhaps? <br>

welcomed you on T-Mat. <br>

ELDRED: So you've been spying on me. <br>
RADNOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. We stopped that a long time ago. <br>
ELDRED: I should think so. What's wrong with running a private museum? <br>
RADNOR: Nothing, but you're doing rather more than that, aren't you,
Daniel. <br>
ELDRED: All right, what if I am? It's a free country, isn't it? What's
wrong with having a hobby? <br>
RADNOR: Rather more than a hobby, preparing an ion rocket for an
unauthorised journey into space. <br>
ELDRED: All right, so you know. What do you intend to do? <br>
RADNOR: My dear fellow, help you, of course. <br>
ELDRED: What? <br>
RADNOR: You can make your trip with full government backing, as long as
it's to the moon. <br>
ELDRED: Why the moon? <br>
KELLY: There's a minor fault developed at T-Mat control at Moonbase. <br>
RADNOR: And we have to put it right, quickly. <br>
ELDRED: I thought T-Mat was infallible. <br>
KELLY: It will be, eventually, however we have no way of reaching the
moon. <br>
ELDRED: Except by out of date rocket. Oh, that's perfect! So you need

ELDRED: It's nowhere near ready, woman! Most of the equipment is still
unchecked. <br>
RADNOR: A computer can be programmed for that. <br>

force and enthusiasm that got it off the drawing board. With you in
control, we can't fail to succeed. <br>
ELDRED: That was a long time past. Now my heart couldn't take the
strain of the G-force. <br>

ZOE: What, for a trip to the moon? <br>

suited to short-range travel. <br>

ELDRED: But the rocket is not ready! <br>

more work is required on your rocket? <br>
ELDRED: It needs fuelling, and a complete computerised check-up. <br>
RADNOR: Well, I can order that. <br>

RADNOR: If there was some other way, believe me I wouldn't even
consider such a risk. <br>

you'll never make a landing at all. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, my word. Oh, that was a dangerous situation! <br>
ZOE: It still is, Doctor. There's an Ice Warrior in the building. <br>
DOCTOR: What? What about Jamie? <br>

nowhere to hide. It fires its weapon at him and he dodges around bits
of equipment before going through another doorway and shutting it
behind him. The Warrior tries to blast its way out. In a corridor -

JAMIE: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie! <br>
ZOE: Oh Jamie, where's the Ice Warrior? <br>
JAMIE: Well, I locked him in the room that we were trapped in. <br>

ZOE: Well, what do we do now? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Commander Radnor's sending some security guards. <br>
JAMIE: A lot of good they'll do against an Ice Warrior. <br>
ZOE: Solar energy. When we were on the moon, Phipps made a trap. <br>
DOCTOR: Solar energy. Reflectors, of course! Well, we ought to be able
to rig something up here. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, well, you'd better be quick about it. That shield thing
won't hold much longer. <br>
(A security team is making its way to the Bureau, clearing its path
with water sprays. The Warrior has made a scorch mark on the door but
that is all. Security reach the Bureau, open the main door and go
inside. The Warrior meets them in a corridor and kills the lead two men
while the others go down another corridor. The Doctor has been busy
with wires, bulbs and two reflectors. Jamie is getting the last of the
foam off the Doctor's jacket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is this the sort of thing that Phipps rigged up, Zoe? <br>
ZOE: Well, sort of. It's not quite the same. His was bigger. <br>

JAMIE: Are you sure that thing works, now? <br>
DOCTOR: The only way to find out is to try, Jamie. Now open the door. <br>
(Jamie opens the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's gone. <br>
JAMIE: Must be chasing after those guards. <br>

the vehicle immediately. <br>

alien's homing signal from the moon. DOCTOR: Well, that means that
their invasion fleet is getting closer. There's not time to be lost.
