foggy night, and a policeman is patrolling his beat past I M Foreman's
Scrap Merchants at 76 Totter's Lane. Inside is an assortment of items,
including a police telephone box.) </font>

GIRL: Night, Miss Wright. <br>
BARBARA: Wait in here, please, Susan. I won't be long. <br>
BOY: Goodnight, Miss Wright. </font></p>

IAN: Oh? Not gone yet? <br>
BARBARA: Obviously not. <br>
IAN: Right, ask a silly question. <br>
BARBARA: I'm sorry. <br>
IAN: That's all right. I'll forgive you this time. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, I had a terrible day. I don't know what to make of it. <br>
IAN: Oh, what's the trouble? Can I help? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, it's one of the girls, Susan Foreman. <br>
IAN: Susan Foreman? She your problem too? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
IAN: You don't know what to make of her? <br>
BARBARA: No. <br>
IAN: How old is she, Barbara? <br>
BARBARA: Fifteen. <br>
IAN: Fifteen. She lets her knowledge out a bit at a time so as not to
embarrass me. That's what I feel about her. She knows more science than
I'll ever know. She's a genius. Is that what she's doing with history? <br>
BARBARA: Something like that. <br>
IAN: So your problem is whether to stay in business or to hand over the
class to her. <br>
BARBARA: No, not quite. <br>
IAN: What, then? <br>
BARBARA: Ian, I must talk to someone about this, but I don't want to
get the girl into trouble. And I know you're going to tell me I'm
imagining things. <br>
IAN: No, I'm not. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I told you how good she is at history. I had a talk with
her and told her she ought to specialise. Well, she seemed quite
interested until I said I'd be willing to work with her at her home.
Then she said that would be absolutely impossible as her grandfather
didn't like strangers. <br>
IAN: He's a doctor, isn't he? That's a bit of a lame excuse. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I didn't pursue the point but then recently her
homework's been so bad. <br>
IAN: Yes, I know. <br>
BARBARA: Finally I got so irritated with all her excuses I decided to
have a talk with this grandfather of hers and tell him to take some
interest in her. <br>
IAN: Did you indeed? And what's the old boy like? <br>
BARBARA: Well, that's just it. I got her address from the secretary, 76
Totter's Lane, and I went along there one evening. Oh Ian, do pay
attention. <br>
IAN: Sorry. You went along there one evening? <br>
BARBARA: There isn't anything there. It's just an old junkyard. <br>
IAN: You must have gone to the wrong place. <br>
BARBARA: Well, that was the address the secretary gave me. <br>
IAN: The secretary got it wrong, then. <br>
BARBARA: No. I checked. There's a big wall on one side, houses on the
other and nothing in the middle. And this nothing in the middle is
number 76 Totter's Lane. <br>
IAN: Hmm. That's a bit of a mystery. Well, there must be a simple
answer somewhere. <br>
BARBARA: Well, what? <br>
IAN: Well, we'll have to find out for ourselves, won't we? <br>
BARBARA: Thank you for the we. She's waiting in one of the classrooms.
I'm lending her a book on the French Revolution. <br>
IAN: What's she going to do, rewrite it? Oh, all right. What do we do?
Ask her point-blank? <br>
BARBARA: No, I thought we could drive there, wait till she arrives and
see where she goes. <br>
IAN: Oh, all right. <br>
BARBARA: That is, if you're not doing anything. <br>
IAN: No, I'm not. After you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Susan is listening to guitar rock music on her
transistor radio. I'm thinking The Shadows. She looks a little elfin,
like Audrey Hepburn) <br>
BARBARA: Susan? <br>
SUSAN: Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Wright. I didn't hear you coming in. Aren't
they fabulous? <br>
BARBARA: Who? <br>
SUSAN: It's John Smith and the Common Men. They've gone from nineteen
to two. <br>
IAN: John Smith is the stage name of the Honourable Aubrey Waites. He
started his career as Chris Waites and the Carollers, didn't he, Susan?
<br>
SUSAN: You are surprising, Mister Chesterton. I wouldn't expect you to
know things like that. <br>
IAN: I have an enquiring mind. And a very sensitive ear. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, I'm sorry. <br>
(She turns the radio off.) <br>
IAN: Thank you. <br>
SUSAN: Is that the book you promised me? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
SUSAN: Thank you very much. It will be interesting. I'll return it
tomorrow. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, that's not necessary. Keep it until you've finished it. <br>
SUSAN: I'll have finished it. <br>
IAN: Oh, where do you live, Susan? I'm giving Miss Wright a lift, I've
got room for one more. <br>
SUSAN: No, thank you, Mister Chesterton. I like walking through the
dark. It's mysterious. <br>
BARBARA: Be careful, Susan, there'll probably be fog again tonight. <br>
SUSAN: Mmm. <br>
BARBARA: See you in the morning. <br>
SUSAN: I expect so. Good night. <br>
BARBARA: Good night. <br>
IAN: Good night, Susan. <br>
(They leave. Susan sits on a desk and starts reading.) <br>
SUSAN: But that's not right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Totter's Lane]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ian and Barbara are parked up.) <br>
BARBARA: Over there. <br>
IAN: We're lucky there was no fog. I'd never have found this. <br>
BARBARA: Well, she doesn't seem to have arrived yet. I suppose we are
doing the right thing, aren't we? <br>
IAN: You can't justify curiosity. <br>
BARBARA: But her homework? <br>
IAN: A bit of an excuse, really, isn't it? I've seen far worse. The
truth is, we're both curious about Susan and we won't be happy until we
know some of the answers. <br>
BARBARA: You can't just pass it off like that. If I thought I was just
being a busybody, I'd go straight home. I thought you agreed she was a
bit of a mystery. <br>
IAN: Yes, but I think you'll find there's a very simple explanation to
all this. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I don't know how you explain the fact that a fifteen
year old girl does not know how many shillings there are in a pound. <br>
IAN: Really? <br>
BARBARA: Really. She said she thought we were on the decimal system. <br>
IAN: Decimal system? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Memory - classroom]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The other pupils are laughing.) <br>
SUSAN: I'm sorry, Miss Wright. <br>
BARBARA: Don't be silly, Susan. The United States has a decimal system.
You know perfectly well that we do not. <br>
SUSAN: Of course, the decimal system hasn't started yet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Totter's Lane]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: I suppose she couldn't be a foreigner? No,
doesn't make sense. Nothing about this girl makes sense. For instance,
the other day I talking about chemical changes. I'd given out the
litmus paper to show cause and effect <br>
BARBARA: And she knew the answer before you'd started. <br>
IAN: Well, not quite. The answer simply didn't interest her. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b> [Memory - laboratory]</b> <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SUSAN: Yes, I can see red turns to blue, Mister
Chesterton, but that's because we're dealing with two inactive
chemicals. They only act in relation to each other. <br>
IAN: But that's the whole point of the experiment, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, it's a bit obvious, isn't it? Well, I'm not trying to be
rude, but couldn't we deal with two active chemicals? Then red could
turn blue all by itself and get on with something else? I'm sorry, it
was just an idea. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Totter's Lane]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: She means it. These simple experiments are
child's play to her. <br>
BARBARA: You know, it's almost got to the point where I deliberately
want to trip her up. <br>
IAN: Yes. Something like that happened the other day. I'd set the class
a problem with A, B and C as the three dimensions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Memory - classroom]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SUSAN: It's impossible unless you use D and E. <br>
IAN: D and E? Whatever for? Do the problem that's set, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: I can't, Mister Chesterton. You can't simply work on three of
the dimensions. <br>
IAN: Three of them? Oh, time being the fourth dimension, I suppose?
Then what do you need E for? What do you make the fifth dimension? <br>
SUSAN: Space. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Totter's Lane]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BARBARA: Too many questions and not enough
answers. <br>
IAN: Stupid? Or just doesn't know. So we have a fifteen year old girl
who is absolutely brilliant at some things, and excruciatingly bad at
others. <br>
BARBARA: There she is. <br>
(Susan looks around then goes into the scrap yard.) <br>
BARBARA: Look, can we go in now? I hate to think of her alone in that
place. <br>
IAN: If she is alone. Look, she is fifteen. She might be meeting a boy.
Didn't that occur to you? <br>
BARBARA: I almost hope she is. <br>
IAN: What do you mean? <br>
BARBARA: Well, it would be so wonderfully normal. It's silly, isn't it?
I feel frightened. As if we're about to interfere in something that is
best left alone. <br>
IAN: Come on, let's get it over with. <br>
(They get out of the car.) <br>
BARBARA: Well, don't you feel it? <br>
IAN: I take things as they come. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Junk yard]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ian has a small torch in his hand. There is no
sign of Susan.) <br>
IAN: What a mess. We're not turning over any of this stuff to find
her.. <br>
BARBARA: Over there? <br>
(Ian falls over a bucket or something.) <br>
IAN: Blast. I've dropped it. <br>
BARBARA: What? <br>
IAN: The torch. <br>
BARBARA: Well, use a match. <br>
IAN: I haven't got any. Oh, never mind. <br>
BARBARA: Susan? <br>
IAN: Susan? Susan? Susan! Susan. Mister Chesterton and Miss Wright. She
can't have got out without us seeing her. <br>
BARBARA: Ian, look at this. <br>
(She's found the police telephone box.) <br>
IAN: It's a police box! What on earth's it doing here? These things are
usually on the street. Feel it. Feel it. Do you feel it? <br>
BARBARA: It's a faint vibration. <br>
IAN: It's alive! <br>
(He walks around it.) <br>
IAN: It's not connected to anything, unless it's through the floor. <br>
BARBARA: Look, I've had enough. Let's go and find a policeman. <br>
IAN: Yes, all right. <br>
(Someone coughs.) <br>
BARBARA: Is that her? <br>
IAN: That's not her. Quick. <br>
(They hide as an old man in Astrakhan hat and a long scarf enters the
yard. He goes to the police box and puts a key in the lock.) <br>
SUSAN [OC]: There you are, Grandfather. <br>
BARBARA: It's Susan. <br>
IAN: Shush! <br>
(Ian comes out from the hiding place.) <br>
IAN: Excuse me. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing here? <br>
IAN: We're looking for a young girl. <br>
DOCTOR: We? <br>
BARBARA: Good evening. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you want? <br>
IAN: One of our pupils, Susan Foreman, came into this yard. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? In here? Are you sure? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, we saw her from across the street. <br>
DOCTOR: (aside) One of their pupils, not the police, then. <br>
IAN: I beg your pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: Why were you were spying on her? Who are you? <br>
IAN: We heard a young girl's voice call out to you. <br>
DOCTOR: Your hearing must be very acute. I didn't hear anything. <br>
BARBARA: It came from in here. <br>
DOCTOR: You imagined it. <br>
BARBARA: I certainly did not imagine it. <br>
DOCTOR: Young man, is it reasonable to suppose that anybody would be
inside a cupboard like that, hmm? <br>
IAN: Would it therefore be unreasonable to ask you to let us have a
look inside? <br>
(The Doctor goes to an ornate picture frame.) <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder why I've never seen that before. Now isn't that
strange. Very damp and dirty. <br>
BARBARA: Won't you help us? We're two of her teachers from the Coal
Hill School. We saw her come in and we haven't seen her leave.
Naturally, we're worried. <br>
DOCTOR: Have to be cleaned. Hmm? Oh, I'm afraid it's none of my
business. I suggest you leave here. <br>
IAN: Not until we're satisfied that Susan isn't in there. And frankly,
I don't understand your attitude. <br>
DOCTOR: Yours leaves a lot to be desired. <br>
IAN: Will you open the door? <br>
DOCTOR: There's nothing in there. <br>
IAN: Then what are you afraid to show us? <br>
DOCTOR: Afraid? Oh, go away. <br>
IAN: I think we'd better go and fetch a policeman. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well. <br>
IAN: And you're coming with us. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, am I? I don't think so, young man. No, I don't think so. <br>
BARBARA: We can't force him. <br>
IAN: But we can't leave him here. Doesn't it seem obvious to you he's
got her locked up in there? Look at it. There's no door handle. There
must be a secret lock somewhere. <br>
BARBARA: That was Susan's voice. <br>
IAN: But of course it was. Susan! Susan! Susan, are you in there? It's
Mister Chesterton and Miss Wright, Susan. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you think you're being rather high-handed, young man? You
thought you saw a young girl enter the yard. You imagine you heard her
voice. You believe she might be inside there. It's not very
substantial, is it? <br>
BARBARA: But why won't you help us? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not hindering you. If you both want to make fools of
yourselves, I suggest you do what you said you'd do. Go and find a
policeman. <br>
IAN: While you nip off quietly in the other direction. <br>
DOCTOR: Insulting. There's only one way in and out of this yard. I
shall be here when you get back. I want to see your faces when you try
to explain away your behaviour to a policeman. <br>
IAN: Nevertheless, we're going to find one. Come on, Barbara. <br>
SUSAN [OC]: What are you doing out there? <br>
IAN: She is in there! <br>
DOCTOR: Close the door! <br>
IAN: Barbara! <br>
(Barbara goes inside the box as Ian briefly struggles with the Doctor
before following her.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Barbara finds herself in a very big room, with
chair, hat stand, various other pieces of furniture, and Susan standing
at a six-sided console in the centre.) <br>
DOCTOR: Close the door, Susan. I believe these people are known to you.
<br>
SUSAN: They're two of my schoolteachers. What are you doing here? <br>
BARBARA: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: They must have followed you. That ridiculous school. I knew
something like this would happen if we stayed in one place too long. <br>
SUSAN: But why should they follow me? <br>
BARBARA: Is this really where you live, Susan? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And what's wrong with it? <br>
IAN: But it was just a telephone box. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps. <br>
BARBARA: And this is your grandfather? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>
BARBARA: But why didn't you tell us that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't discuss my private life with strangers. <br>
IAN: But it was a police telephone box. I walked all around it.
Barbara, you saw me. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't deserve any explanations. You pushed your way in here
uninvited and unwelcome. <br>
BARBARA: I think we ought to leave. <br>
IAN: No, just a minute. I know this is absurd, but I feel <br>
(The Doctor is examining an ornate clock.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear, dear, dear dear. This is very <br>
IAN: I walked all round it. <br>
DOCTOR: It's stopped again, you know, and I've tried hmm? Oh, you
wouldn't understand. <br>
IAN: But I want to understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. By the way, Susan, I managed to
find a replacement for that faulty filament. It's an amateur job, but I
think it'll serve. <br>
IAN: It's an illusion. It must be. <br>
DOCTOR: What is he talking about now? <br>
SUSAN: What are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: You don't understand, so you find excuses. Illusions, indeed?
You say you can't fit an enormous building into one of your smaller
sitting rooms. <br>
IAN: No. <br>
DOCTOR: But you've discovered television, haven't you? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Then by showing an enormous building on your television screen,
you can do what seemed impossible, couldn't you? <br>
IAN: Well, yes, but I still don't know <br>
DOCTOR: Not quite clear, is it. I can see by your face that you're not
certain. You don't understand. And I knew you wouldn't. Never mind. Now
then, which switch was it? No. No, no. Ah yes, that is it. The point is
not whether you understand. What is going to happen to you, hmm?
They'll tell everybody about the ship now. <br>
IAN: Ship? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, ship. This doesn't roll along on wheels, you know. <br>
BARBARA: You mean it moves? <br>
SUSAN: The Tardis can go anywhere. <br>
BARBARA: Tardis? I don't understand you, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Well, I made up the name Tardis from the initials, Time And
Relative Dimension In Space. I thought you'd both understand when you
saw the different dimensions inside from those outside. <br>
IAN: Just let me get this straight. A thing that looks like a police
box, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite so. <br>
IAN: But that's ridiculous. <br>
SUSAN: Why won't they believe us? <br>
BARBARA: How can we? <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, don't get exasperated, Susan. Remember the Red
Indian. When he saw the first steam train, his savage mind thought it
an illusion, too. <br>
IAN: You're treating us like children. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I? The children of my civilisation would be insulted. <br>
IAN: Your civilisation? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, my civilisation. I tolerate this century, but I don't
enjoy it. Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in the
fourth dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off from
our own planet, without friends or protection. But one day we shall get
back. Yes, one day. One day. <br>
SUSAN: It's true. Every word of it's true. You don't know what you've
done coming in here. Grandfather, let them go now, please. Look, if
they don't understand, they can't, they can't hurt us at all. I
understand these people better than you. Their minds reject things they
don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
IAN: He can't keep us here. <br>
BARBARA: Susan, listen to me. Can't you see that all this is an
illusion? It's a game that you and your grandfather are playing, if you
like, but you can't expect us to believe it. <br>
SUSAN: It's not a game! <br>
BARBARA: But Susan, it's <br>
SUSAN: It's not! Look, I love your school. I loved England in the
twentieth century. The last five months have been the happiest of my
life. <br>
BARBARA: But you are one of us. You look like us, you sound like us. <br>
SUSAN: I was born in another time, another world. <br>
IAN: Now look here, Susan, you. Oh, come on, Barbara, let's get out of
here. <br>
SUSAN: It's no use, you can't get out. He won't let you go. <br>
IAN: He closed the doors from over there. I saw him. Now, which is it?
Which is it? Which control operates the door? <br>
DOCTOR: You still think it's all an illusion? <br>
IAN: I know that free movement time and space is a scientific dream I
don't expect to find solved in a junkyard. <br>
DOCTOR: Your arrogance is nearly as great as your ignorance.<br>
IAN: Will you open the door? Open the door! Susan, will you help us? <br>
SUSAN: I mustn't.&nbsp;<br>
IAN: Very well, then. I'll have to risk it myself. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't stop you. <br>
SUSAN: Don't touch it! It's live! <br>
(Ian gets an electric shock from the console.) <br>
BARBARA: Ian! What on earth do you think you're doing? <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, let them go now, please. <br>
DOCTOR: And by tomorrow we shall be a public spectacle, a subject for
news and idle gossip.<br>
SUSAN: But they won't say anything.<br>
DOCTOR: My dear child, of course they will. Put yourself in their
place. They are bound to make some sort of a complaint to the
authorities, or at the very least talk to their friends. If I do let
them go, Susan, you realise of course we must go, too.<br>
SUSAN: No, Grandfather, we've had all this out before. <br>
DOCTOR: There's no alternative, child. <br>
SUSAN: I want to stay! But they're both kind people. Why won't you
trust them? All you've got to do is ask them to promise to keep our
secret <br>
DOCTOR: It's out of the question. <br>
SUSAN: I won't go, Grandfather. I won't leave the twentieth century.
I'd rather leave the Tardis and you.<br>
DOCTOR: Now you're being sentimental and childish. <br>
SUSAN: No, I mean it.<br>
DOCTOR: Very well. Then you must go with them. I'll open the door.<br>
BARBARA: Are you coming, Susan? <br>
(But instead of flipping the switch to open the doors, the Doctor
starts the time rotor moving.)<br>
SUSAN: Oh, no, Grandfather! No!<br>
DOCTOR: Let me go.<br>
SUSAN: No!<br>
DOCTOR: Get back to the ship, child. Hold it.<br>
(Ian and Barbara are thrown from side to side. The Doctor and Susan
hang on to the console. Eventually Barbara lands in the chair and Ian
on the floor. The Tardis heads into the vortex with a lot of noise and
the opening title effects superimposed over the Doctor and Susan's
faces. Later, it is peaceful and quiet. On the scanner is a view of a
desolate, scrubby land. The shadow of a scruffy figure in animals skins
is looking at the Tardis)<br>

ZA: My father made fire. <br>
MOTHER: They killed him for it. It is better that we live as we have
always done. <br>
ZA: He showed me how to sharpen the stones and trap the bear and the
tiger. He should have shown me this, too. <br>
MOTHER: So that everyone would bow to you as they did to him? <br>
ZA: Tell me what my father did to make fire. <br>

the leader. My father will give me to him. <br>
ZA: Kal is no leader. <br>
HUR: The leader is the one who makes fire. <br>

BARBARA: Ian? Ian. <br>
IAN: I'm all right. I must have hit my head. The movement's stopped. <br>
SUSAN: The base is steady. <br>
DOCTOR: Layer of sand, rock formation. Good. <br>
SUSAN: We've left 1963. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, undoubtedly. I'll be able to tell you where presently.
Zero? That's not right. I'm afraid this yearometer is not calculating
properly. Hm! Well, anyway, the journey's finished. (to Ian) What are
you doing down there? <br>
BARBARA: What have you done? <br>
IAN: Barbara, you don't believe all this nonsense. <br>
SUSAN: Well, look at the scanner screen. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, look up there. They don't understand and I suspect they
don't want to. Well, there you are. A new world for you. <br>
IAN: Sand and rock? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the immediate view outside the ship. <br>
BARBARA: But where are we? <br>
IAN: You mean that's what we'll see when we go outside? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, you'll see it for yourself. <br>
IAN: I don't believe it. <br>
DOCTOR: You really are a stubborn young man, aren't you? <br>
IAN: All right, show me some proof. Give me some concrete evidence. I'm
sorry, Susan, I don't want to hurt you, but it's time you were brought
back to reality. <br>
SUSAN: But you're wrong, Mister Chesterton. <br>
DOCTOR: They are saying I'm a charlatan. What concrete evidence would
satisfy you? <br>
IAN: Just open the doors, Doctor Foreman. <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about? <br>
BARBARA: They're so sure, Ian. <br>
IAN: Yes, I know. <br>
BARBARA: And remember the difference between the outside of the police
box and the inside. <br>
IAN: Yes, I know, but. Are you going to open the doors or aren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
IAN: You see? <br>
DOCTOR: Not until I'm quite sure it's safe to do so. Well, yes, good.
Yes, it is, it's good. Excellent, excellent. You've got the radiation
counter there. What's it read? <br>
SUSAN: It's reading normal, Grandfather. <br>
DOCTOR: Splendid, splendid. Well, I think I'll take my Geiger counter
with me in any case. So, you still challenge me, young man? <br>
IAN: Well, just open the doors and prove your point. <br>
DOCTOR: You're so narrow-minded, aren't you? Don't be so insular. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, do you know where we are? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we've gone back in time, all right. One or two samples and
I shall be able to make an estimate. With rock pieces and a few plants.
But I do wish this wouldn't keep letting me down. However, we can go
out now. <br>
IAN: Just a minute. You say we've gone back in time? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. <br>
IAN: So that when we go out of that door, we won't be in a junkyard in
London in England in the year 1963? <br>
DOCTOR: That is quite correct. But your tone suggests ridicule. <br>
IAN: But it is ridiculous. Time doesn't go round and round in circles.
You can't get on and off whenever you like in the past or the future. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Where does time go, then? <br>
IAN: It doesn't go anywhere. It just happens and then it's finished. <br>
DOCTOR: (to Barbara) You're not as doubtful as your friend, I hope? <br>
BARBARA: No. <br>
IAN: Barbara, you can't <br>
BARBARA: I can't help it. I just believe them, that's all.<br>
DOCTOR: If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange
birds and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
(The Doctor opens the doors) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, see for yourself. <br>
IAN: It's not true. It can't be. <br>
SUSAN: That's not on the screen. <br>
DOCTOR: Well I've no more time to argue with you. I must get some
samples, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Be careful, Grandfather. <br>
DOCTOR: (exiting, muttering) Oh, dear, it's disgusting really. <br>

BARBARA: Ian, come out and look. <br>

IAN: But there must be some explanation. <br>
DOCTOR: It's still a police box. Why hasn't it changed? Dear, dear, how
very disturbing. <br>
(The Doctor collects his rock samples, watched by the primitive man.
Barbara comes across an animal skull in the sand) <br>
BARBARA: What do you think it could be? Ian, look at this. <br>
IAN: I don't know. It hasn't got any horns or antlers. Could be a
horse. Could be anything. Incredible. A police box in the midst of. Oh,
it just doesn't make sense. <br>
SUSAN: It should have changed. Wonder why it hasn't happened this time.
<br>
BARBARA: The ship, you mean? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, it's been an Ionic column and a sedan chair. <br>
BARBARA: Disguising itself wherever it goes. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, that's right. But it hasn't happened this time. I wonder
why not. I wonder if this old head would help Grandfather. Where is he?
<br>
BARBARA: You're very quiet. <br>
IAN: I was wrong, wasn't I. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, look, I don't understand it any more than you do. The
inside of the ship, suddenly finding ourselves here. Even some of the
things Doctor Foreman says <br>
IAN: That's not his name. Who is he? Doctor who? Perhaps if we knew his
name we might have a clue to all this. <br>
BARBARA: Look, Ian, the point is, it's happened. <br>
IAN: Yes, it has. But it's impossible to accept. I know I'm here <br>
SUSAN: I can't see him anywhere. <br>
BARBARA: He can't be far away. I had a feeling just now as if we were
being watched. Grandfather. <br>
(The Doctor is lighting his pipe when the primitive man attacks. The
Doctor cries out) <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather! <br>
IAN: Come on! <br>
(They run to where the Doctor was gathering his samples, and find his
bag on the ground) <br>
IAN: Look. <br>
SUSAN: What is it? <br>
BARBARA: Some of his things. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, where are you? <br>
IAN: Susan, don't panic. <br>
SUSAN: I must find him. <br>
IAN: Susan. <br>
SUSAN: I must see. <br>
IAN: Well, be careful then. <br>
BARBARA: Ian, look. <br>
IAN: (broken Geiger counter) It's not much good any more. <br>
BARBARA: Well, maybe he saw something and went off to investigate. <br>
IAN: Leaving this? (his hat) <br>
BARBARA: Well, what do you think happened? <br>
IAN: I don't know. Perhaps he was excited and went off to investigate
something as you suggest, but. He may have been taken. <br>
SUSAN: I can't see him. I can't find him anywhere. There's not a sign
of him. <br>
IAN: Calm down, Susan. <br>
BARBARA: Susan, don't worry. What's the matter? <br>
SUSAN: It's his notes. He'd never leave his notebook. It's too
important to him. It's got the key codes of all the machines in the
ship. It's got notes of everywhere we've been to. Something terrible
has happened to him, I know it has. We must find him. <br>
BARBARA: Susan, Susan. We'll find him, I promise you. He can't be far
away. <br>
IAN: What's on the other side of those rocks? <br>
SUSAN: There's a line of trees. There's a gap in them. There might be a
path on the other side. <br>
IAN: (gathering up the Doctor's things) All right, we'll try there
first. Come on. Strange. <br>
BARBARA: What? <br>

them under a leopard's skin) <br>
HORG: Kal says, where he comes from, he's often seen men make fire. <br>
ZA: Kal is a liar. <br>
HORG: He says Orb will soon show him how it is done. <br>
ZA: All his tribe died in the last cold. If he had not found us, he
would have died too. <br>
HUR: What else did he say? <br>
HORG: He says Orb only shows the secret to the leader. <br>
ZA: I am leader. Orb will show me. I am the son of the great firemaker,
but he does not show me how to put flames into the sticks. Kal comes. I
do not kill him. I let him eat with us and sleep in our caves. I will
have to spill some blood and make people bow to me. <br>
(There's a commotion as the Doctor is brought in and laid across a
large rock) <br>
ZA: This is a strange creature. <br>
KAL: Is Za, son of the firemaker, afraid of an old man? When will Za
make fire come from his hands? <br>
ZA: When Orb decides it. <br>
KAL: Orb is for strong men. Orb has sent me this creature to make fire
come from his fingers. I have seen it. Inside, he's full of fire. The
smoke comes from his mouth. <br>
ZA: As lies come out of yours. He wears strange skins. <br>
KAL: Za is afraid. There was a strange tree. The creature was in it. Za
would have run away had he seen it. <br>
ZA: Silence! <br>
KAL: When I saw fire come from his fingers I remembered Za, son of the
firemaker. And when the cold comes, you will all die if you wait for Za
to make fire for you. I, Kal, am a true leader. We fought like the
tiger and the bear. My strength was too much for him. He lay down to
sleep. And I, Kal, carried him here to make fire for you. <br>
ZA: Why do you listen to Kal? <br>
HORG: Za has many good skins. He has forgotten what the cold is like. <br>
ZA: Tomorrow, I kill many bears. You all have warm skins. <br>
HORG: I say tomorrow you will rub your hands together and hold them to
the dry sticks and ask Orb to send you fire. And the bears will stay
warm in their own skins. <br>
ZA: What I say I will do, I will do. <br>
KAL: The firemaker is dead. You all carry dry sticks with you. But
tonight, I make them burn. I am leader. <br>
HUR: The creature has opened its eyes. <br>
DOCTOR: Where's my, where. <br>
KAL: Do you want fire, or do you want to die in the cold? <br>
ALL: Fire! Fire! <br>
KAL: When it's cold, the tiger comes to our caves again at night. Za
will give you to the tiger. Za will give you to the cold. Za rubs his
hands and waits for Orb to remember him. My creature can make fire come
from his fingers. I have seen it. But I, Kal, brought him here. The
creature is mine. <br>
ZA: He's just an old man in strange skins. Kal has been with us too
long. It is time he died. <br>
HORG: I say there is truth in both of you. Za speaks truth, but fire
cannot live in men. And Kal speaks the truth that we die without fire. <br>
HUR: Will my father listen to a woman? If this old man can make fire
come from his fingers, let us see it now. <br>
ZA: I say what is to be done here, not old men and women. <br>
KAL: Za tries to talk like his father, the firemaker. Za does not want
to see fire made. But I, Kal, am not afraid of fire. I will make my
creature make fire. <br>
(The Doctor sits up) <br>
ZA: I will take him to the Cave of Skulls and he will tell me the
secret! <br>
DOCTOR: I can make fire for you. Let me go and I'll make all the fire
you want. You don't have to be afraid of me. I'm an old man. How can an
old man like me harm any of you? <br>
ZA: What does he say? <br>
HORG: Fire? He says he can make fire for us. <br>
KAL: He makes it for me and I give you fire. I am firemaker. <br>
ZA: He will make it for me. <br>
DOCTOR: (searching his pockets) My matches. Where are they? I must get
back. Must get back to the ship. <br>
KAL: Kal's creature, he makes fire only for Kal. <br>
DOCTOR: Take me back to my ship and I will make fire for you. All the
fire you want. <br>
ZA: This is more of your lies. The old man cannot make fire. <br>
KAL: There was a tree and the creature came from in it. And the fire,
it came out of his fingers. <br>
ZA: You want to be strong like Za, son of the great firemaker. You all
heard him say that there would be fire. There is no fire. Za does not
tell you lies. He does not say, I will do this thing, and then not do
it. He does not say, I will make you warm, and then leave you to the
dark. He does not say, I will fight away the tiger with fire, and then
let him come to you in the dark. Do you want a liar for your chief? <br>
ALL: No! <br>
KAL: Make fire. Make fire. <br>
HUR: You are trapped in your own lies, Kal. <br>
ZA: Great chief who is afraid of nothing. Oh great Kal, save us from
the cold. Save us from the tiger. <br>
KAL: Make fire. Make fire come from your fingers as I saw you. <br>
DOCTOR: I have no matches. I cannot make fire. I cannot make fire! <br>
ZA: Let the old man die. And we'll watch the great Kal as he kills his
strong enemy. <br>
KAL: Make fire! Make fire! Or I kill you now! <br>
ZA: Or we'll keep them and make them hunt for us. It's good to have
someone to laugh at! <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather! <br>
(Susan, Ian and Barbara are quickly overpowered) <br>
DOCTOR: If he dies, there will be no fire. <br>
(Kal is fascinated by Barbara) <br>
MOTHER: Kill her. Kill her. <br>
ZA: Wait. You cannot kill all our enemies. When Orb gives fire back to
the sky, let him look down on them. Then that is when they die, and Orb
will give us fire again. Take them to the Cave of Skulls. <br>
SUSAN: No! Grandfather! <br>
DOCTOR: All right. <br>
(Hur goes to Za, and her father tries to pull her back) <br>
ZA: The woman is mine. <br>
HORG: My daughter is for the leader of the tribe. <br>
ZA: Yes, the woman is mine. <br>
HORG: I do not like what has happened. <br>
ZA: Old men never like new things to happen. <br>
HORG: I was a great leader of many men. <br>
ZA: Many men, yes. They all dies when Orb left the sky and the great
cold was on the ground. And Orb will give me fire again. To me. Not to
you. Just as you will give me her. <br>
HUR: Za will be a strong leader of many men. If you give me to him, he
will remember and always give you meat. <br>
MOTHER: There were leaders before there was fire. Fire will kill us all
in the end. You should have killed the four strangers. Kill them. <br>

DOCTOR: It must have just been killed. By a larger animal, too. <br>
IAN: Shush. Shush. That must be them. They followed us. Quick, quick.
Over there. <br>
(The four hide, and Hur and Za enter) <br>
IAN: Keep down, and not a sound. <br>
ZA: Wait. There is danger. I will go. <br>
(We don't actually see it, of course, but Za gets attacked by whatever
killed the boar) <br>
IAN: Quick, now's our chance. Let's get away. Run! <br>
BARBARA: Look at them. We can't just leave them! I don't care what
they've done. <br>
IAN: Barbara. Barbara, come on. <br>
BARBARA: I think he's dead. There isn't any danger. <br>
IAN: Barbara, for heaven's sake. <br>
BARBARA: No. <br>
SUSAN: I'm going too. <br>
DOCTOR: Susan! You stay here with me. <br>
SUSAN: No, Grandfather. We can't leave them. <br>
DOCTOR: Silence! We're going back to the ship. <br>
SUSAN: No! <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing? They must be out of their minds. <br>
(Za is badly wounded, and Hur is crying) <br>
HUR: No, keep away. <br>
IAN: Let me look at him. <br>
HUR: No. <br>
IAN: I am your friend. You understand? Friend. I want to help him. <br>
HUR: Friend? <br>
IAN: I want water. <br>
HUR: Water. <br>
IAN: Go and fetch some water for his wounds. <br>
HUR: Water is there. <br>
BARBARA: Please, show me. Give me your handkerchief. <br>
IAN: Here you are. <br>
SUSAN: Is he all right? <br>
IAN: I think so. He must have buried his axe head in the animal. Thank
you. <br>
(Barbara and Ian bathe his wounds) <br>
HUR: Water comes out of the skin! <br>
IAN: Yes. I think most of this is the animal's blood. <br>
SUSAN: Good. <br>
BARBARA: There's a scar on the side of his head. <br>
IAN: Well, we've lost our chance of getting away. Your flat must be
littered with stray cats and dogs. <br>
BARBARA: These are human beings, Ian. <br>
IAN: Yes, I know. <br>
DOCTOR: What exactly do you think you're doing? <br>
IAN: Have you got any antiseptic in the ship? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, lots. <br>
DOCTOR: One minute ago we were trying desperately to get away from
these savages. <br>
IAN: All right, now we're helping them. You're a doctor, do something. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not a doctor of medicine. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, we can make friends with them. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be ridiculous, child. <br>
BARBARA: Why? You treat everybody and everything as something less
important than yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: You're trying to say that everything you do is reasonable, and
everything I do is inhuman. Well, I'm afraid your judgement's at fault,
Miss Wright, not mine. Haven't you realised if these two people can
follow us, any of these people can follow us? The whole tribe might
descend upon us at any moment. <br>
HUR: The tribe is asleep. <br>
DOCTOR: And what about the old woman who cut our bonds? You understand?
<br>
IAN: He's right. We're too exposed here. We'll make a stretcher and
carry him. <br>
DOCTOR: You're not going to take him back to the ship? <br>
IAN: Take your coat off, Barbara. Susan, try and find me two poles.
Long ones, fairly straight. <br>
BARBARA: The old woman won't give us away. She helped. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you think so? These people have logic and reason, have they?
Can't you see their minds change as rapidly as night and day? She's
probably telling the whole tribe at this very moment. </font></p>

SUSAN: He's always like this if he doesn't get his own way. <br>
BARBARA: The old woman won't give us away. And now that we've got these
two on our side, we should get back to the ship. <br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>

DOCTOR: Get your hand off me. <br>

HUR: The young man of their tribe came towards you, but he did not
kill. He told me his name. <br>
ZA: Name? <br>
HUR: His name is Friend. <br>
ZA: They come from the other side of the mountains. <br>
HUR: Nothing lives there. <br>
ZA: There are other tribes there. This new tribe must come from there.
Tell me more of what happened. <br>
HUR: I did not understand them. Their hands moved slowly and their
faces were not fierce. It was like a mother guarding her baby. <br>
ZA: They are a new tribe. Not like us. Not like Kal. The young one,
whose name is Friend, spoke to me. <br>
HUR: Do you remember it? <br>
ZA: He said, Kal is not stronger than the whole tribe. <br>
HUR: I do not understand. <br>
ZA: The whole tribe drove Kal away with the stones. The whole tribe can
collect more fruit than one. The whole tribe can kill a beast where one
of the tribe would die. <br>
HUR: Do you think they come from Orb? <br>
ZA: No. They are a tribe who know how fire is made, but they do not
want to tell us. <br>
HUR: Then you will not kill them? <br>
ZA: Horg says the leader must know how fire is made. I do not want to
be driven into the forest like Kal. I must make fire, or they must die,
as the old men say. I will speak with him. I must hear more things to
remember. The leader would have things to remember. </font></p>

me how to make fire, I will take you back to the foot of the mountains.
