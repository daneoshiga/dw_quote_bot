half the homes boarded up. A man is helping a boy to read.) <br>
MO: But who is this creature with terrible claws, terrible teeth in his
terrible jaws? Go on, your bit. He, he has. Go on. <br>
ELLIOT: I can't do it, Dad. I can listen to books, anyway. <br>
MO: I know it doesn't come easy, son, but you've got to keep at it. All
right? You're not on your own with this. <br>
(A woman brings a lunch box.) <br>
AMBROSE: Mo, you'll be late for your shift. <br>
MO: Yeah, you're right. Sorry, El, got to go. Now, who loves you more
than me? <br>
ELLIOT: No one. <br>
AMBROSE: Stop saying that. <br>

depth. Stage four target drill depth scheduled in five, four, three,
two, one. Stage four target drill depth achieved. Drill depth now
twenty one kilometres. <br>
(Quiet celebrations. The Indian woman in charge makes a telephone
call.) <br>
NASREEN: Hi. Nasreen here. Just to let you know we have just hit our
new target. <br>
(The older man, Tony Mack, makes an announcement on the tannoy.) <br>
MACK: Twenty one kilometres, folks. Further than anyone's ever drilled
into the Earth. Thanks for your amazing work. Have a great weekend.
Onwards and downwards.<br>
NASREEN: How much further do you think we can we go, Mack? <br>
MACK: Into the unknown. Exciting, isn't it? <br>
NASREEN: Yeah. <br>
(Mo enters.) <br>
MO; Aye, aye. Stop that. The real worker's here now. <br>
MACK: Evening, Mo. <br>
MO: Twenty one k? Whoo hoo. You wanted to grab all the glory before I
come on shift. Right, off you go. Get out. My gaff for the night. <br>
(All alone with the computer screens, Mo gets the book out of his
knapsack - the Gruffalo.) <br>
MO: Brilliant. <br>

dead one by one. The power fails so Mo takes a torch to check
everything is okay.)

AMY: Nah. <br>
RORY: Not really getting the sunshine carnival vibe. <br>
DOCTOR: No? Ooo, feel that, though. What's that? <br>
(The Doctor jumps up and down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ground feels strange. Just me. Wait. That's weird. <br>
RORY: What's weird? <br>
AMY: Doctor, stop trying to distract us. We're in the wrong place.
Doctor, it's freezing and I've dressed for Rio. We are not stopping
here. Doctor. You listening to me? It's a graveyard. You promised me a
beach. <br>
DOCTOR: Blue grass. Patches of it all around the graveyard. So, Earth,
2020-ish, ten years in your future, wrong continent for Rio, I'll
admit, but it's not a massive overshoot. <br>
AMY: Why are those people waving at us? <br>
(Two figures on the other side of the valley.) <br>
DOCTOR: Can't be. <br>
(Rory starts to wave back.) <br>
AMY: Don't. <br>
(The Doctor uses a pair of binoculars.) <br>
DOCTOR: It is. It's you two. <br>
RORY: No, we're here. How can we be up there? <br>
DOCTOR: Ten years in your future. Come to relive past glories, I'd
imagine. Humans, you're so nostalgic. <br>
AMY: We're still together in ten years? <br>
RORY: No need to sound so surprised. <br>
AMY: Hey, let's go and talk to them. We can say hi to future us. How
cool is that? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, no, best not. Really best not. These things get complicated
very quickly, and oh look. Big mining thing. Oh, I love a big mining
thing. See, way better than Rio. Rio doesn't have a big mining thing. <br>
AMY: We're not going to have a look, are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go and have a look. Come on, you two, let's see what
they're doing. <br>
RORY: If he can't get us to Rio, how's he ever going to get us back
home? <br>
AMY: Did you not see over there? It all works out fine. <br>
RORY: After everything we've seen, we just drop back into our old
lives? The nurse and the kissogram? <br>
AMY: I guess. He's getting away. <br>
RORY: Hang on. What are you doing with that? <br>
AMY: Engagement ring. I thought you liked me wearing it. <br>
RORY: Amy, you could lose it. Cost a lot of money, that. <br>
AMY: Hmm. Spoilsport. <br>
(Amy gives the ring to Rory.) <br>
RORY: Go on. I'll catch you both up. <br>

Nobody's been in or out of the perimeter between last night and now.

there? <br>
NASREEN: I don't know.

the console. He comes out of the Tardis to meet Elliot's mum.) <br>
AMBROSE: Well, that was quick. <br>
RORY: Was it? <br>
AMBROSE: It's great that you came. <br>
ELLIOT: Bit retro. What is it, portable crime lab? <br>
RORY: Oh, er, sort of. <br>
AMBROSE: Ambrose Northover. I was the one who called. I run the meals
on wheels for the whole valley. This is my son, Elliot. <br>
ELLIOT: Where's your uniform? <br>
AMBROSE: Don't be cheeky, Elliot. He's plain clothes. CID, is it?
Anyway, it's over here. <br>
RORY: Er, okay.

AMBROSE: It's a family plot, see. My aunt Gladys died six years ago.
Her husband, Alun, died a few weeks back. He lived in the house two
doors down. There's not many of us left up here now. <br>
ELLIOT: Mum, he doesn't care about that. He wants to know about the
dead bodies. <br>
AMBROSE: Yes. Sorry. Well, they always wanted to be buried in the same
plot, together. But when we went to bury Uncle Alun, Gladys wasn't
there. Gone. Body, coffin, everything. <br>
RORY: What? <br>
AMBROSE: The mad thing is, on the surface, the grave was untouched. No
signs of it having been messed with. <br>
RORY: I'm sorry, I don't understand. <br>
AMBROSE: Nobody has touched the grave since my aunt was buried. But
when they dug it open, the body was gone. How is that possible?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: What about now? Can you feel it now? <br>
AMY: Honestly, I've got no idea what you're on about. <br>
DOCTOR: The ground doesn't feel like it should. <br>
AMY: It's ten years in the future. Maybe how this ground feels is how
it always feels. <br>
DOCTOR: Good thought, but no, it doesn't. Hear that, drill in start-up
mode. Afterwaves of a recent seismological shift and blue grass. <br>
(Of which the Doctor has a few leaves. He tries eating one.) <br>

NASREEN: Who are you? What're you doing here? And what're you wearing? <br>
AMY: I dressed for Rio. <br>
DOCTOR: Ministry of Drills, Earth and Science. New Ministry, quite big,
just merged. It's lot of responsibility on our shoulders. Don't like to
talk about it. What are you doing? <br>
NASREEN: None of your business. <br>
DOCTOR: Where are you getting these readings from? <br>
NASREEN: Under the soil. <br>
MACK: The drill's up and running again. What's going on? Who are these
people? <br>
AMY: Amy, the Doctor. We're not staying, are we, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Why's there a big patch of earth in the middle of your floor? <br>
NASREEN: We don't know. It just appeared overnight. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Right. You all need to get out of here very fast. <br>
NASREEN: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: What's your name? <br>
NASREEN: Nasreen Chaudhry. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at the screens, Nasreen. Look at your readings. It's
moving. <br>
MACK: Hey, that's specialised equipment. Get away from it. <br>
(Amy squats down by the hole.) <br>
NASREEN: What is? <br>
AMY: Doctor, this steam, is that a good thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Shouldn't think so. It's shifting when it shouldn't be
shifting. <br>
NASREEN: What shouldn't? <br>
(Rumble.) <br>
DOCTOR: The ground, the soil, the earth, moving. But how? Why? <br>
AMY: Earthquake? <br>
MACK: What's going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Doubt it, because it's only happening under this room. <br>
(Two more holes appear in the floor, then three more.) <br>
DOCTOR: It knows we're here. It's attacking. The ground's attacking us.
<br>
NASREEN: No, no that's not possible. <br>
DOCTOR: Under the circumstances, I'd suggest, run! <br>
(They do. More holes appear and Mack's foot does down one of them.) <br>
NASREEN: Tony! <br>
DOCTOR: Stay back, Amy. Stay away from the earth. <br>
(Amy jumps over a hole to help Mack.) <br>
AMY: It's okay. <br>
(A hole opens under Amy's feet.) <br>
AMY: It's pulling me down. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy! <br>
AMY: Doctor, help me. Something's got me. <br>
DOCTOR: Stay away from it. <br>
AMY: Doctor, the ground's got my legs. <br>
DOCTOR: I've got you. <br>
AMY: Okay. <br>
(Nasreen pulls Mack free.) <br>
AMY: Don't let go. <br>
DOCTOR: Never. <br>
AMY: Doctor, what is it, and why is it doing this? <br>
DOCTOR: Stay calm. Keep hold of my hand. Don't let go. Your drill, shut
it down. Go. Now! <br>
(Nasreen and Mack run out.) <br>
AMY: Can you get me out? <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, try and stay calm. If you struggle, it'll make things
worse. Keep hold of my hand. </font></p>

ELLIOT: Do you want sugar? <br>
RORY: Sorry? <br>
ELLIOT: In your tea. Mum's asking. <br>
RORY: No. Just white, thanks. <br>
ELLIOT: There's only one explanation, as far as I can see. <br>
RORY: What's that, then? <br>
ELLIOT: The graves eat people. Devour them whole, leaving no trace. <br>
RORY: Not sure about that. <br>
ELLIOT: They didn't steal the body from above. They couldn't have got
in from the sides. Only other thing is, they get in from underneath. <br>
RORY: Not very likely, though. <br>
ELLIOT: When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth. <br>
RORY: Sorry? <br>
ELLIOT: Sherlock Holmes. Got the audiobook. The graves round here eat
people. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MACK: Is that what happened to Mo? Are they dead? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not quicksand. She didn't just sink. Something pulled her
in. It wanted her. <br>
NASREEN: The ground wanted her? <br>
DOCTOR: You said the ground was dormant. Just a patch of earth, when
you first saw it this morning. And the drill had been stopped. <br>
MACK: That's right. <br>
DOCTOR: But when you re-started the drill, the ground fought back. <br>
NASREEN: So what, the ground wants to stop us drilling? Doctor, that is
ridiculous. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not saying that, and it's not ridiculous, I just don't
think it's right. Oh, of
course. It's bio-programming. <br>
NASREEN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Bio-programming. Oh, it's clever. You use bio-signals to
resonate the internal molecular structure of natural objects. It's
mainly used in engineering and construction, mostly jungle planets, but
that's way in the future and not here. What's it doing here? <br>
NASREEN: Sorry, did you just say jungle planets? <br>
MACK: You're not making any sense, man. <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me, I'm making perfect sense. You're just not keeping
up. The earth, the ground beneath our feet, was bio-programmed to
attack. <br>
NASREEN: Yeah, even if that were possible, which, by the way, it's not,
why? <br>
DOCTOR: Stop you drilling. Okay, so we find whatever's doing the
bio-programming, we can find Amy. We can get her back. Shush, shush,
shush. Have I gone mad? I've gone mad. <br>
NASREEN: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Silence. Absolute silence. You've stopped the
drill, right? <br>
NASREEN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And you've only got the one drill? <br>
NASREEN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: You're sure about that? <br>
MACK: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: So, if you shut the drill down, why can I still hear drilling?
It's under the ground. <br>
MACK: That's not possible. <br>
(The Doctor sonicks the computers nearby.) <br>
NASREEN; Oh no, what, what are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Hacking into your records. Probe reports, samples, sensors.
Good. Just unite the data, make it all one big conversation. Let's have
a look. So, we are here and this is your drill hole. Twenty one point
zero zero nine kilometres. Well done. <br>
NASREEN: Thank you. It's taken us a long time. <br>
DOCTOR: Why here, though? Why'd you drill on this site? <br>
NASREEN; We found patches of grass in this area, containing trace
minerals unseen in this country for twenty million years. <br>
DOCTOR: The blue grass? Oh, Nasreen. Those trace minerals weren't X
marking the spot, saying dig here. They were a warning. Stay away.
Because while you've been drilling down, somebody else has been
drilling up. <br>
(The deep sensor readings resolve themselves on the screen.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, beautiful. Network of tunnels all the way down. <br>
MACK: No, no, we've surveyed that area. <br>
DOCTOR: You only saw what you went looking for. <br>
NASREEN; What are they? <br>
DOCTOR: Heat signals. Wait, dual readings, hot and cold, doesn't make
sense. And now they're moving. Fast. How many people live nearby? <br>
MACK: Just my daughter and her family. The rest of the staff travel in.
<br>
DOCTOR: Grab this equipment and follow me. <br>
NASREEN: Why? What're we doing? <br>
DOCTOR: That noise isn't a drill, it's transport. Three of them, thirty
kilometres down. Rate of speed looks about a hundred and fifty
kilometres an hour. Should be here in ooo, quite soon. Twelve minutes.
Whatever bio-programmed the Earth is on its way up, now.

only the Earth's crust down there? <br>
DOCTOR: You saw the readings. <br>
NASREEN: Who are you, anyway? How can you know all this? <br>
(Slow red lightning in the sky.) <br>
NASREEN: Whoa, did you see that? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. <br>
(The Doctor uses his catapult to fire a stone into the air. It hits an
energy shield and vapourises.) <br>
DOCTOR: Energy signal originating from under the Earth. We're trapped. <br>
RORY: Doctor, something weird's going on here, the graves are eating
people. <br>
DOCTOR: Not now, Rory. Energy barricade, invisible to the naked eye. We
can't get out and no one from the outside world can get in. <br>
RORY: What? Okay, what about the Tardis? <br>
NASREEN: The what? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, no. Those energy patterns would play havoc with the
circuits. With a bit of time, maybe, but we've only got nine and a half
minutes. <br>
RORY: Nine and a half minutes to what? <br>
NASREEN: We're trapped, and something's burrowing towards the surface. <br>
RORY: Where's Amy? <br>
DOCTOR: Get everyone inside the church. Rory, I'll get her back. <br>
RORY: What do you mean, get her back? Where's she gone? <br>
DOCTOR: She was taken. Into the Earth. <br>
RORY: How? Why didn't you stop it? <br>
DOCTOR: I tried. I promise, I tried. <br>
RORY: Well, you should've tried harder! <br>
DOCTOR: I'll find Amy. I'll keep you all safe, I promise. Come on,
please. I need you alongside me. <br>

DOCTOR: Two phase plan. First, the sensors and cameras will tell us
when something arrives. Second, if something does arrive, I use this to
send a sonic pulse through that network of devices. A pulse which would
temporarily incapacitate most things in the universe. <br>

RORY: It's getting darker. How can it be getting dark so quickly? <br>

us in the dark. Which means <br>

MACK: The banging's stopped. <br>

in when the door was shut? Who counted him back in? Who saw him last? <br>

AMBROSE: My dad's hurt. <br>

just killed them up here. There's still hope, Ambrose. There is always

hisses nearby and he lets it off. It screams. Rory bursts out of the

rattling.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I've come to talk. I'm going to remove your
mask. <br>
(The mask looks like a reptile face, with very big black eyes. He
removes it gently.) <br>
DOCTOR: You are beautiful. Remnant of a bygone age on planet Earth. And
by the way, lovely mode of travel. Geothermal currents projecting you
up through a network of tunnels. Gorgeous. Mind if I sit? Now. Your
people have a friend of mine. I want her back. Why did you come to the
surface? What do you want? Oh, I do hate a monologue. Give us a bit
back. How many are you? <br>
ALAYA: I'm the last of my species. <br>
DOCTOR: Really. No. Last of the species. The Klempari Defence. As an
interrogation defence, it's a bit old hat, I'm afraid. <br>
ALAYA: I'm the last of my species. <br>
DOCTOR: No. You're really not. Because I'm the last of my species and I
know how it sits in a heart. So don't insult me. Let's start again.
Tell me your name. <br>
ALAYA: Alaya. <br>
DOCTOR: How long has your tribe been sleeping under the Earth, Alaya?
It's not difficult to work out. You're three hundred million years out
of your comfort zone. Question is, what woke you now? <br>
ALAYA: We were attacked. <br>
DOCTOR: The drill. <br>
ALAYA: Our sensors detected a threat to our life support systems. The
warrior class was activated to prevent the assault. We will wipe the
vermin from the surface and reclaim our planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Do we have to say vermin? They're really very nice. <br>
ALAYA: Primitive apes. <br>
DOCTOR: Extraordinary species. You attack them, they'll fight back.
But, there's a peace to be brokered here. I can help you with that. <br>
ALAYA: This land is ours. We lived here long before the apes. <br>
DOCTOR: Doesn't give you automatic rights to it now, I'm afraid. Humans
won't give up the planet. <br>
ALAYA: So we destroy them. <br>
DOCTOR: You underestimate them. <br>
ALAYA: You underestimate us. <br>
DOCTOR: One tribe of homo reptilia against six billion humans? You've
got your work cut out. <br>
ALAYA: We did not initiate combat, but we can still win. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me where my friend is. Give us back the people who were
taken. <br>
ALAYA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not going let you provoke a war, Alaya. There'll be no
battle here today. <br>
ALAYA: The fire of war is already lit. A massacre is due. <br>
DOCTOR: Not while I'm here. <br>

DOCTOR: I'm going to go down below the surface, to find the rest of the
tribe, to talk to them. <br>
AMBROSE: You're going to negotiate with these aliens? <br>
DOCTOR: They're not aliens. They're Earth-liens. Once known as the
Silurian race, or, some would argue, Eocenes, or Homo
Reptilia. Not monsters, not evil. Well, only as evil as you are. The
previous owners of the planet, that's all. Look, from their point of
view, you're the invaders. Your drill was threatening their settlement.
Now, the creature in the crypt. Her name's Alaya. She's one of their
warriors, and she's my best bargaining chip. I need her alive. If she
lives, so do Elliot and Mo and Amy, because I will find them. While I'm
gone, you four people, in this church, in this corner of planet Earth,
you have to be the best of humanity. <br>
MACK: And what if they come back? Shouldn't we be examining this
creature? Dissecting it, finding its weak points? <br>
DOCTOR: No dissecting, no examining. We return their hostage, they
return ours, nobody gets harmed. We can land this together, if you are
the best you can be. You are decent, brilliant people. Nobody dies
today. Understand? <br>
