CANTON: Suspect directly ahead. Coming to you now. Over. <br>
(Another vehicle is coming from the opposite direction. They trap her
by a cliff.) <br>
AMY: Canton. <br>
CANTON: Miss Pond. <br>
AMY: Is that a body bag? <br>
CANTON: Yes, it is. <br>
AMY: It's empty. <br>

CANTON: There's nothing behind me. <br>

notices saying Do Not Approach The Prisoner and Do Not Interact With
The Prisoner, and has grown a beard.) <br>
TANNOY: All visitors to remain behind the yellow line. All visitors to
remain behind the yellow line.&nbsp;<br>
CANTON: We found Amy Pond. She had strange markings on her arm. Do you
know what they are? <br>

CANTON: Doctor Song? Doctor Song? Go! Go! Go! <br>
(They catch up with her at an open wall.) <br>
CANTON: Don't move! It's over. <br>
RIVER: They're here, Canton. They're everywhere. <br>
CANTON: I know. America's being invaded. <br>
RIVER: You were invaded a long time ago. America is occupied. <br>
CANTON: You're coming with us, Doctor Song. There's no way out this
time. <br>
RIVER: There's always a way out. <br>

DOCTOR: These bricks, what are they made of? Where is she? <br>
CANTON: She ran. Off the fiftieth floor. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd say zero balance dwarf star alloy. The densest material in
the universe. Nothing gets through that. You're building me the perfect

on his skin runs out onto the top of the dam, only to find lots of men
with guns waiting for him, and it's a long way down.) <br>
RORY: What are you waiting for? <br>
CANTON: I'm waiting for you to run. It'd look better if I shot you
while you're running. Then again, looks aren't everything. <br>

star alloy cell.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is there a reason you're doing this? <br>
CANTON: I want you to know where you stand. <br>
DOCTOR: In a cell. <br>
CANTON: In the perfect cell. Nothing can penetrate these walls. Not a
sound, not a radio wave, not the tiniest particle of anything. <br>
(Canton closes the door when the soldiers leave. It vanishes. There is
a palm print panel near where it should be.) <br>
CANTON: In here, you're literally cut off from the rest of the
universe. So I guess they can't hear us, right? <br>
DOCTOR: Good work, Canton. Door sealed? <br>
CANTON: You bet. <br>
(The Doctor shakes off his shackles and strait-jacket. The body bags
sit up, gasping for breath.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you okay? <br>
AMY: Finally. <br>
RORY: These things could really do with air holes. <br>
CANTON: Never had a complaint before. <br>
AMY: Isn't it going to look odd that you're staying in here with us? <br>
CANTON: Odd, but not alarming. They know there's no way out of this
place. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Whatever they might think we're doing in here, they
know we're not going anywhere. <br>
(The Doctor slumps to his right, and leans against the Tardis. He snaps
his fingers to open the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Shall we? <br>
CANTON: What about Doctor Song?

DOCTOR: Don't worry. She does that. Amy, Rory, open all the doors to
the swimming pool. <br>
(River turns into a dive, and plummets through the Tardis' open door
where it is parked on the side of the skyscraper. There is a big
Splosh!) <br>
DOCTOR: So, we know they're everywhere. Not just a landing party, an
occupying force, and they 'have been here a very, very long time. But
nobody knows that, because no one can remember them. <br>
CANTON: So what are they up to? <br>
DOCTOR: No idea. But the good news is, we've got a secret weapon.

RIVER: Apollo 11's your secret weapon? <br>

Armstrong's foot.

the first time. Today, the President reaffirmed America's commitment <br>
CANTON: Ready. Check. <br>
(Amy looks at her palm. No tally marks.) <br>
AMY: Clear. <br>

CANTON: Clear.

Canton's palm.) <br>
CANTON: Ow! <br>
DOCTOR: Ha. So, three months. What have we found out? <br>
RORY: Well, they are everywhere. Every state in America. Ahh. <br>
(Rory got his injection.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not just America, the entire world. <br>
RIVER: There's a greater concentration here, though. <br>
AMY: Ow! <br>
DOCTOR: Are you okay? <br>
AMY: All better. <br>
DOCTOR: Better? <br>
AMY: Turns out I was wrong. I'm not pregnant. <br>
RORY: What's up? <br>
AMY: Nothing. Really, nothing. Seriously. <br>
CANTON: So you've seen them, but you don't remember them. <br>
RIVER: You've seen them, too. That night at the warehouse, remember?
While you were pretending to hunt us down, we saw hundreds of those
things. We still don't know what they look like. <br>
RORY: It's like they edit themselves out of your memory as soon as you
look away. The exact second you're not looking at them, you can't
remember anything. <br>
AMY: Sometimes you feel a bit sick, though, but not always. <br>
CANTON: So that's why you marked your skin. <br>
AMY: Only way we'd know if we'd had an encounter. <br>
CANTON: How long have they been here? <br>
AMY: That's what we've spent the last three months trying to find out. <br>
RORY: Not easy, if you can't remember anything you discover. <br>
CANTON: How long do you think? <br>
DOCTOR: As long as there's been something in the corner of your eye, or
creaking in your house, or breathing under your bed, or voices through
a wall. They've been running your lives for a very long time now, so
keep this straight in your head. We are not fighting an alien invasion,
we're leading a revolution. And today, the battle begins. <br>
CANTON: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Like this. <br>
(The Doctor quickly injects River.) <br>
RIVER: Ow! <br>
DOCTOR: (laughs) Nanorecorder. Fuses with the cartilage in your hand.
(injects himself) Ow. And it tunes itself directly to the speech
centres in your brain. It'll pick up your voice, no matter what.
Telepathic connection. So, the moment you see one of the creatures, you
activate it, and describe aloud exactly what you're seeing. <br>
DOCTOR: [OC]: And describe aloud exactly what you're seeing. <br>
DOCTOR: Because the moment you break contact, you're going to forget it
happened. The light will flash if you've left yourself a message. You
keep checking your hand if you've had an encounter. That's the first
you'll know about it. <br>
CANTON: Why didn't you tell me this before we started? <br>
DOCTOR: I did, but even information about these creatures erases itself
over time. I couldn't refresh it because I couldn't talk to you. <br>
(Canton looks away then turns back and adjusts the Doctor's bow tie.) <br>
CANTON: What? What are you staring at? <br>
RIVER: Look at your hand. <br>
(A little dot is flashing.) <br>
CANTON: Why is it doing that? <br>
DOCTOR: What does it mean if the light's flashing? What did I just tell
you? <br>
CANTON: I haven't <br>
DOCTOR: Play it. <br>
CANTON [OC]: My God, how did it get in here? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Keep eye contact with the creature and, when I say, turn
back, and when you do, straighten my bow tie. <br>
CANTON [OC]: What? What are you staring at? <br>
RIVER [OC]: Look at your hand. <br>
(One of the aliens is standing there.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's a hologram, extrapolated from the photo on Amy's phone.
Take a good, long look. <br>
(The Doctor turns off the image.) <br>
DOCTOR: You just saw an image of one of the creatures we're fighting.
Describe it to me. <br>
CANTON: I can't. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Neither can I. You straightened my bow tie because I
planted the idea in your head while you were looking at the creature. <br>
AMY: So they could do that to people. You could be doing stuff and not
really knowing why you're doing it. <br>
RORY: Like posthypnotic suggestion. <br>
AMY: Ruling the world with posthypnotic suggestion? <br>
DOCTOR: Now then, a little girl in a spacesuit. They got the suit from
NASA, but where did they get the girl? <br>
CANTON: It could be anywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Except they'd probably stay close to that warehouse, because
why bother doing anything else? And they'd take her from somewhere that
would cause the least amount of attention. But you'll have to find her.
I'm off to NASA. <br>
CANTON: Find her? Where do we look? <br>
DOCTOR: Children's homes.

AMY: It's the kids, yeah? They did that. <br>
RENFREW: Yes, the children. It must be, yes. Anyway, my office is this
way. <br>
CANTON: We nearly didn't come to this place. I understood Graystark
Hall was closed in 67. <br>
RENFREW: That's the plan, yes. <br>
AMY: The plan? <br>
RENFREW: Not long now. <br>
CANTON: It's 1969. <br>
RENFREW: No, no. We close in 67. That's the plan, yes. <br>

TELEVISION: The target for the Apollo 11 astronauts, the Moon, at

RIVER: It's an exoskeleton. Basically, life support. There's about
twenty different kinds of alien tech in here. <br>
DOCTOR: Who was she? Why put her in here? <br>
RIVER: You put this on, you don't even need to eat. The suit processes
sunlight directly. It's got built in weaponry, and a communications
system that can hack into anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Including the telephone network? <br>
RIVER: Easily. <br>
DOCTOR: But why phone the President? <br>
RIVER: It defaults to the highest authority it can find. The little
girl gets frightened, the most powerful man on Earth gets a phone call.
The night terrors with a hotline to the White House. <br>
(The Doctor licks his invitation envelope.) <br>
RIVER: You won't learn anything from that envelope, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: Purchased on earth. Perfectly ordinary stationery. Tardis blue.
Summoned by a stranger who won't even show his face. That's a first,
for me. How about you? <br>
RIVER: Our lives are back to front. Your future's my past. Your firsts
are my lasts. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not really what I asked. <br>
RIVER: Ask something else, then. <br>
DOCTOR: What are the Silence doing, raising a child? <br>
RIVER: Keeping her safe, even giving her independence. <br>
DOCTOR: The only way to save Amy is to work out what the Silence are
doing. <br>
RORY: I know. <br>
DOCTOR: And every single thing we learn about them brings us a step
closer. <br>
RORY: Yeah, Doctor, I get it. I know. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, it's possible she's not just any little girl. <br>
RIVER: Well, I'd say she's human, going by the life support software. <br>
DOCTOR: But? <br>
RIVER: She climbed out of this suit. Like she forced her way out. She
must be incredibly strong. <br>
DOCTOR: Incredibly strong and running away. I like her. <br>
RIVER: We should be trying to find her. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But how? Anyway, I have the strangest feeling
she's going to find us. <br>
TELEVISION: Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over. <br>
RORY: Why does it look like a NASA spacesuit? <br>
DOCTOR: Because that's what the Silence do. Think about it. They don't
make anything themselves. They don't have to. They get other life forms
to do it for them. <br>
RIVER: So they're parasites, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Superparasites, standing in the shadows of human history since
the very beginning. We know they can influence human behaviour any way
they want. If they've been doing that on a global scale for thousands
of years. <br>
RORY: Then what? <br>
DOCTOR: Then why did the human race suddenly decide to go to the Moon? <br>
TELEVISION: Ten, nine. Ignition sequence start. six, five, four <br>
DOCTOR: Because the Silence needed a spacesuit. <br>
TELEVISION: One, zero. All engines running. Liftoff. We have a liftoff.
Thirty two minutes past the hour, liftoff on Apollo 11.

RORY: Then why haven't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Because then what? I find her and then what do I do? This isn't
an alien invasion. They live here. This is their empire. This is

about to find out. Rory, River, keep one Silent in eyeshot at all
times. Oh, hello. Sorry, you were in the middle of something. I just
had to say, though, have you seen what's on the telly? Oh, hello, Amy.
Are you all right? Want to watch some television? Ah. Now, stay where
you are. Because look at me, I'm confident. You want to watch that, me,
when I'm confident. Oh, and this is my friend River. Nice hair, clever,
has her own gun, and unlike me, she really doesn't mind shooting
people. I shouldn't like that. Kind of do, a bit. <br>
RIVER: Thank you, sweetie. <br>
DOCTOR: I know you're team players and everything, but she'll
definitely kill at least the first three of you. <br>

going to kill the first three of you to attack, plus him behind, so
maybe you want to draw lots or have a quiz. <br>
(Rory is trying to free Amy.) <br>
AMY: What's he got? <br>
RORY: Something, I hope. <br>
DOCTOR: Or maybe you could just listen a minute. Because all I really
want to do is accept your total surrender and then I'll let you go in
peace. Yes, you've been interfering in human history for thousands of
years. Yes, people have suffered and died, but what's the point in two
hearts, if you can't be a bit forgiving, now and then? Ooo, the
Silence. You guys take that seriously, don't you? Okay, you got me. I'm
lying. I'm not really going to let you go that easily. Nice thought,
but it's not Christmas. First, you tell me about the girl. Who is she?
Why is she important? What's she for? <br>
McCANDLESS [OC]: And we're getting a picture on the TV. <br>
DOCTOR: Guys, sorry, but you're way out of time. Now, come on. A bit of
history for you. Aren't you proud? Because you helped. Now, do you know
how many people are watching this live on the telly? Half a billion.
And that's nothing, because the human race will spread out among the
stars. You just watch them fly. Billions and billions of them, for
billions and billions of years, and every single one of them at some
point in their lives, will look back at this man,
taking that very first step, and they will never, ever forget it. <br>
