a grand old manor house.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, smell that air. Grass and lemonade. And a little bit of
mint. A hint of mint. Must be the nineteen twenties. <br>
DONNA: You can tell what year it is just by smelling? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. <br>
DONNA: Or maybe that big vintage car coming up the drive gave it away. <br>
(An open topped tourer turns on the gravel in front of the house and
sounds its horn. Two servants come out, the butler and a
footman. The butler is not called Jeeves. This is not Wodehouse-land.)<br>
GREEVES: The Professor's baggage, Richard. Step lively. <br>
(The older driver gets out and removes his goggles.) <br>
GREEVES: Good afternoon, Professor Peach. <br>
PEACH: Hello, Greeves, old man. <br>
(The young vicar rides up on his bicycle.) <br>
PEACH: Ah, Reverend. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Professor Peach. Beautiful day. The Lord's in his heaven,
all's right with the world. <br>
GREEVES: Reverend Golightly. Lady Eddison requests you make yourselves
comfortable in your rooms. Cocktails will be served on the lawn from
half past four. <br>
PEACH: You go on up. I need check something in the library. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Oh? <br>
PEACH: Alone. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: It's supposed to be a party. All this work will be the death
of you. <br>
(The Doctor and Donna are eavesdropping in the shrubbery.) <br>
DONNA: Never mind Planet Zog. A party in the nineteen twenties, that's
more like it. <br>
DOCTOR: The trouble is, we haven't been invited. Oh, I forgot. Yes, we
have. </font></p>

PEACH: I was right. Kept secret all these years. It's unbelievable. <i>But
why didn't they ask? Heavens!</i> <br>
(The bits in italics are book titles. All will become clear soon. The
Professor has been startled by a noise. Someone has entered the room.
He hides the papers behind his back.) <br>
PEACH: Oh, it's you. I was just doing a little research. I say, what
are you doing with that lead piping? <br>
(There is a buzzing sound, and we see the Professor through
multifaceted eyes.) <br>
PEACH: But that's impossible. Oh, no! <br>
(We are shown a wasp as the deed is done in the library with the lead
piping. Very Cluedo.)

DOCTOR: Flapper. You look lovely.

CHANDRAKALA: Look sharp. We have guests. <br>
DOCTOR: Good afternoon. <br>
DAVENPORT: Drinks, sir? Ma'am? <br>
DONNA: Sidecar, please. <br>
DOCTOR: And a lime and soda, thank you. <br>
GREEVES: May I announce Lady Clemency Eddison. <br>
(Lady Eddison is a petite older woman.) <br>
DOCTOR: Lady Eddison. <br>
CLEMENCY: Forgive me, but who exactly might you be, and what are you
doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. And this is Miss Donna Noble, of the Chiswick
Nobles. <br>
(Donna puts on a posh accent and drops a curtsey.) <br>
DONNA: Good afternoon, my lady. Topping day, what? Spiffing. Top hole. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. No, don't do that. Don't. <br>
(The Doctor shows the psychic paper to Lady Eddison.) <br>
DOCTOR: We were thrilled to receive your invitation, my lady. We met at
the Ambassador's reception. <br>
CLEMENCY: Doctor, how could I forget you? But one must be sure with the
Unicorn on the loose. <br>
DOCTOR: A unicorn? Brilliant. Where? <br>
CLEMENCY: The Unicorn. The jewel thief? Nobody knows who he is. He's
just struck again. Snatched Lady Babbington's pearls right from under
her nose. <br>
DONNA: Funny place to wear pearls. <br>
GREEVES: May I announce Colonel Hugh Curbishley, the Honourable Roger
Curbishley. <br>
(Roger is pushing his father's wheelchair.) <br>
CLEMENCY: My husband, and my son. <br>
CURBISHLEY: Forgive me for not rising. Never been the same ever since
that flu epidemic back in eighteen. <br>
ROGER: My word, you are a super lady. <br>
DONNA: Oh, I like the cut of your jib. Chin, chin. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. <br>
ROGER: How do you do? <br>
DOCTOR: Very well. <br>
DAVENPORT: Your usual, sir? <br>
ROGER: Ah. Thank you, Davenport. Just how I like it. <br>
DONNA: How come she's an Eddison, but her husband and son are
Curbishleys? <br>
DOCTOR: The Eddison title descends through her. One day Roger will be a
lord. <br>
GREEVES: Robina Redmond. <br>
(A fashionable young woman.) <br>
CLEMENCY: She's the absolute hit of the social scene. A must. Miss
Redmond. <br>
ROBINA: Spiffing to meet you at last, my lady. What super fun. <br>
GREEVES: Reverend Arnold Golightly. <br>
CLEMENCY: Ah, Reverend. How are you? I heard about the church last
Thursday night. Those ruffians breaking in. <br>
CURBISHLEY: You apprehended them, I hear. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: As the Christian Fathers taught me, we must forgive them
their trespasses. Quite literally. <br>
ROGER: Some of these young boys deserve a descent thrashing. <br>
DAVENPORT: Couldn't agree more, sir. <br>
DONNA: Typical. All the decent men are on the other bus. <br>
DOCTOR: Or Time Lords. <br>
ROGER: Now, my lady. What about this special guest you promised us? <br>
CLEMENCY: Here she is. A lady who needs no introduction. <br>
(A thirty-something woman is embarrassed by the applause.) <br>
AGATHA: No, no, please, don't. Thank you, Lady Eddison. Honestly,
there's no need. <br>
AGATHA: Agatha Christie. <br>
DONNA: What about her? <br>
AGATHA: That's me. <br>
DONNA: No. You're kidding. <br>
DOCTOR: Agatha Christie. I was just talking about you the other day. I
said, I bet she's brilliant. I'm the Doctor. This is Donna. Oh, I love
your stuff. What a mind. You fool me every time. Well, almost every
time. Well, once or twice. Well, once. But it was a good once. <br>
AGATHA: You make a rather unusual couple. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. We're not married. <br>
DONNA: We're not a couple. <br>
AGATHA: Well, obviously not. No wedding ring. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, you don't miss a trick. <br>
AGATHA: I'd stay that way if I were you. The thrill is in the chase,
never in the capture. <br>
CLEMENCY: Mrs Christie, I'm so glad you could come. I'm one of your
greatest followers. I've read all six of your books. Er, is, er, Mister
Christie not joining us? <br>
AGATHA: Is he needed? Can't a woman make her own way in the world? <br>
CURBISHLEY: Don't give my wife ideas. <br>
ROGER: Now Mrs Christie, I have a question. Why a Belgian detective? <br>
(The Doctor borrows the Colonel's newspaper.) <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me, Colonel. <br>
AGATHA: Belgians make such lovely buns. <br>
ROGER: I say, where on Earth's Professor Peach? He'd love to meet Mrs
Christie. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Said he was going to the library. <br>
CLEMENCY: Miss Chandrakala, would you go and collect the Professor? <br>
CHANDRAKALA: At once, Milady. <br>
DOCTOR: The date on this newspaper. <br>
DONNA: What about it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's the day Agatha Christie disappeared. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: She'd just discovered her husband was
having an affair. <br>
DONNA: You'd never think to look at her, smiling away. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, she's British and moneyed. That's what they do. They
carry on. Except for this one time. No one knows exactly what happened.
She just vanished. Her car will be found tomorrow morning by the side
of a lake. Ten days later, Agatha Christie turns up in a hotel in
Harrogate. Said she'd lost her memory. She never spoke about the
disappearance till the day she died, but whatever it was. <br>
DONNA: It's about to happen. <br>
DOCTOR: Right here, right now. <br>
CHANDRAKALA: Professor! The library! Murder! Murder! </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor enters, followed by Donna and Agatha.
He goes to the body. <br>
GREEVES: Oh, my goodness. <br>
DOCTOR: Bashed on the head. Blunt instrument. Watch broke as he fell.
Time of death was quarter past four. <br>
(He look through the papers on the desk.) <br>
DONNA: A bit of pipe. Call me Hercules Poirot, but I reckon that's
blunt enough. <br>
(Agatha finds a piece of burnt paper in the grate and puts it in her
bag.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing worth killing for in that lot. Dry as dust. <br>
DONNA: Hold on. The <i>Body In The Library</i>? I mean,
Professor Peach, in the library, with the lead piping? <br>
(The other guests force their way in.) <br>
CLEMENCY: Let me see. <br>
CURBISHLEY: Out of my way. <br>
CLEMENCY: Gerald? <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Saints preserve us. <br>
ROBINA: Oh how awful. <br>
AGATHA: Someone should call the police. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't have to. Chief Inspector Smith from Scotland Yard,
known as the Doctor. Miss Noble is the plucky young girl who helps me
out. <br>
(He flashes the psychic paper again.) <br>
CLEMENCY: I say. <br>
DOCTOR: Mrs Christie was right. Go into the sitting room. I will
question each of you in turn. <br>
AGATHA: Come along. Do as the Doctor says. Leave the room undisturbed. <br>
(Agatha leads the others away.) <br>
DONNA: The plucky young girl who helps me out? <br>
DOCTOR: No policewomen in 1926. <br>
DONNA: I'll pluck you in a minute. Why don't we phone the real police? <br>
DOCTOR: Well the last thing we want is PC Plod sticking his nose in,
especially now I've found this. Morphic residue. <br>
(He scrapes some gunge off the floorboards.) <br>
DONNA: Morphic? Doesn't sound very 1926. <br>
DOCTOR: It's left behind when certain species genetically re-encode. <br>
DONNA: The murderer's an alien? <br>
DOCTOR: Which means one of that lot is an alien in human form. <br>
DONNA: Yeah, but think about it. There's a murder, a mystery, and
Agatha Christie. <br>
DOCTOR: So? Happens to me all the time. <br>
DONNA: No, but isn't that a bit weird? Agatha Christie didn't walk
around surrounded by murders. Not really. I mean, that's like meeting
Charles Dickens and he's surrounded by ghosts at Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: Well. <br>
DONNA: Oh, come on! It's not like we could drive across country and
find Enid Blyton having tea with Noddy. Could we? Noddy's not real. Is
he? Tell me there's no Noddy. <br>
DOCTOR: There's no Noddy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DONNA: Next thing you know, you'll be telling me
it's like <i> Murder On The Orient Express</i>, and they
all did it. <br>
AGATHA: Murder on the Orient Express? <br>
DONNA: Ooo, yeah. One of your best. <br>
DOCTOR: But not yet. <br>
AGATHA: Marvellous idea, though. <br>
DONNA: Yeah. Tell you what. Copyright Donna Noble, okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Anyway. Agatha and I will question the suspects. Donna, you
search the bedrooms. Look for clues. (sotto) Any more residue. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll need this. <br>
(A large magnifying glass.) <br>
DONNA: Is that for real? <br>
DOCTOR: Go on. You're ever so plucky. <br>
(Donna takes the magnifying glass and goes upstairs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right then. Solving a murder mystery with Agatha Christie.
Brilliant. <br>
AGATHA: How like a man to have fun while there's disaster all around
him. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. Yeah. <br>
AGATHA: I'll work with you, gladly, but for the sake of justice, not
your own amusement. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is conducting individual interviews as
Agatha takes notes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now then, Reverend. Where were you at a quarter past four? <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Let me think. Why yes, I remember. I was unpacking in my
room. <br>
DOCTOR: No alibi, then. <br>
AGATHA: You were alone? <br>
GOLIGHTLY: With the Lord, one is never truly alone, Doctor? <br>
(And on to the next suspect.)&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: And where were you? <br>
ROGER: Let me think. I was. Oh, yes. I was taking a constitutional in
the fields behind the house. Just taking a stroll, that's all. <br>
DOCTOR: Alone? <br>
ROGER: Oh, yes, all alone. Totally alone. Absolutely alone. Completely.
All of the time. <br>
(In Roger's memory, he meets Davenport, the pretty young footman, and
goes off with him, hand in hand.) <br>
ROGER: I wandered lonely as the proverbial cloud. There was no one else
with me. Not at all. Not ever. <br>
(Next.) <br>
DOCTOR: And where were you? <br>
ROBINA: At a quarter past four. Well, I went to the toilet when I
arrived, and then er. Oh, yes, I remember. I was preparing myself. <br>
(She is checking a small revolver she is carrying in her little bag.) <br>
ROBINS: Positively buzzing with excitement about the party and the
super fun of meeting Lady Eddy. <br>
DOCTOR: We've only got your word for it. <br>
ROBINA: That's your problem, not mine. <br>
(Then it is the turn of -) <br>
DOCTOR: And where were you, sir? <br>
CURBISHLEY: Quarter past four? Dear me, let me think. Ah, yes, I
remember. I was in me study, reading through some military memoirs.
Fascinating stuff. <br>
(Pictures of young ladies dressed only in a string of pearls,
actually.) <br>
CURBISHLEY: Took me back to my days in the army. Started reminiscing.
Mafeking, you know. Terrible war. <br>
(Except he is recalling a can-can dance.) <br>
DOCTOR: Colonel, snap out of it. <br>
CURBISHLEY: I was in me study <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Right out of it. <br>
CURBISHLEY: Oh, sorry. Got a bit carried away there. <br>
(Next.) <br>
DOCTOR: And where were you at a quarter past four, my lady? <br>
CLEMENCY: Now, let me see. Yes, I remember. I was sitting in the Blue
Room, taking my afternoon tea. <br>
(Draining a hip flask of its contents.) <br>
CLEMENCY: It's a ritual of mine. I needed to gather strength for the
duty of hostess. I then proceeded to the lawn where I met you, Doctor,
and I said, who exactly might you be and what are you doing here? And
you said, I am the Doctor and this is Miss Donna Noble. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. You can stop now. I was there for that bit. <br>
CLEMENCY: Of course. (hic) Excuse me. <br>
(Later, the two detectives are pacing.) <br>
AGATHA: No alibis for any of them. The <i>Secret Adversary</i>
remains hidden. We must look for a motive. Use ze little grey cells. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, little grey cells. Good old Poirot. You know, I've
been to Belgium. Yeah. I remember I was deep in the Ardennes, trying to
find Charlemagne. He'd been kidnapped by an insane computer. <br>
(The Doctor recalls making his way through the woods with a machete and
bow and quiver slung across his back.) <br>
AGATHA: Doctor? Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. <br>
AGATHA: Charlemagne lived centuries ago. <br>
DOCTOR: I've got a very good memory. <br>
AGATHA: For such an experienced detective, you missed a big clue. <br>
DOCTOR: What, that bit of paper you nicked out the fire? <br>
AGATHA: You were looking the other way. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, but I saw you reflected in the glass of the bookcase. <br>
AGATHA: You crafty man. This is all that was left. <br>
(The charred fragment says aiden.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's that first letter? <i>N or M?</i> <br>
AGATHA: It's an M. The word is maiden. <br>
DOCTOR: Maiden! What does that mean? <br>
AGATHA: We're still no further forward. Our <i>Nemesis</i>
remains at large. Unless Miss Noble's found something.

up behind her.) <br>
GREEVES: You won't find anything in there. <br>
DONNA: How come it's locked? <br>
GREEVES: Lady Eddison commands it to be so. <br>
DONNA: And I command it to be otherwise. Scotland Yard. Pip, pip. <br>
(Greeves unlocks the door.) <br>
DONNA: Why's it locked in the first place? <br>
GREEVES: Many years ago, when my father was butler to the family, Lady
Eddison returned from India with malaria. She locked herself in this
room for six months until she recovered. Since then, the room has
remained undisturbed. </font></p>

of the little bed.) <br>

DONNA: How long's it been empty? <br>
GREEVES: Forty years. <br>
DONNA: Why would she seal it off? All right, I need to investigate. You
just butle off. <br>
(Donna closes the door and starts to look around. She hears an insect
buzzing around.) <br>
DONNA: 1926, they've still got bees. Oh, what a noise. All right, busy
bee, I'll let you out. Hold on, I shall find you with my amazing powers
of detection. <br>
(Donna pulls the curtains open to reveal a giant wasp outside. It
smashes through the glass.) <br>
DONNA: That's impossible. <br>
(Donna backs up to the broken window.) <br>
DONNA: Doctor! <br>

onto the insect. The pain gives her the chance to run out of the room.)

DOCTOR: What do you mean, a giant wasp? <br>
DONNA: I mean, a wasp that's giant. <br>
AGATHA: It's only a silly little insect. <br>
DONNA: When I say giant, I don't mean big, I mean flipping enormous!

pencil.) <br>
DOCTOR: Giant wasp. Well, tons of amorphous insectivorous lifeforms,
but none in this galactic vector. <br>
AGATHA: I think I understood some of those words. Enough to know that
you're completely potty. <br>
DONNA: Lost its sting, though. That makes it defenceless. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, a creature this size? Got to be able to grow a new one. <br>
AGATHA: Can we return to sanity? There are no such things as giant
wasps. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. So. The question is, what's it doing here? </font></p>

your work. <br>
DAVENPORT: But who'd want to do in the old professor? He was always
asking questions about that book of his. What's all that about? <br>

DOCTOR: She said, the poor little child. Does that mean anything to
anyone? <br>
CURBISHLEY: No children in this house for years. Highly unlikely there
will be. <br>

DONNA: Oh, blimey, I've done it again. <br>
AGATHA: I appreciate you trying to be kind, but you're right. These
murders are like my own creations. It's as though someone's mocking me,
and I've had enough scorn for one lifetime. <br>
DONNA: Yeah. Thing is, I had this bloke once. I was engaged. And I

AGATHA: I see. Is my marriage the stuff of gossip now? <br>
DONNA: No, I just. Sorry. <br>
AGATHA: No matter. The stories are true. I found my husband with
another woman. A younger, prettier woman. Isn't it always the way? <br>
DONNA: Well, mine was with a giant spider, but, same difference. <br>
AGATHA: You and the Doctor talk such wonderful nonsense. <br>
DONNA: Agatha, people love your books. They really do. They're going to
be reading them for years to come. <br>
AGATHA: If only. Try as I might, it's hardly great literature. Now
that's beyond me. I'm afraid my books will be forgotten, like ephemera.
Hello, what's that? Those flowerbeds were perfectly neat earlier. now
some of the stalks are bent over. <br>

would use. <br>
AGATHA: The Unicorn. He's here. <br>
DOCTOR: The Unicorn and the wasp. <br>
(Greeves enters.) <br>
GREEVES: Your drinks, ladies. Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Very good, Greeves. <br>
(Greeves leaves.) <br>
DONNA: How about the science stuff. What did you find? <br>
DOCTOR: Vespiform sting. Vespiforms have got hives in the Silfrax
galaxy. <br>
AGATHA: Again, you talk like Edward Lear. <br>
DOCTOR: But for some reason, this one's behaving like a character in
one of your books. <br>
DONNA: Come on, Agatha. What would Miss Marple do? She'd have overheard
something vital by now, because the murderer thinks she's just a
harmless old lady. <br>
AGATHA: Clever idea. Miss Marple? Who writes those? <br>
DONNA: Er, copyright Donna Noble. Add it to the list. <br>
DOCTOR: Donna. <br>
DONNA: Okay, we could split the copyright. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Something's inhibiting my enzymes. Argh! I've been
poisoned. <br>
(The Doctor is nearly doubled up in pain.) <br>
DONNA: What do we do? What do we do?. <br>
(Agatha sniffs his drink.) <br>
AGATHA: Bitter almonds. It's cyanide. <i> Sparkling Cyanide</i>.

AGATHA: I'm an expert in poisons. Doctor, there's no cure. It's fatal. <br>
(The Doctor spits out the surplus ginger beer.) <br>

DOCTOR: Harvey Wallbanger? <br>
DONNA: Well, I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: How is Harvey Wallbanger one word? <br>
AGATHA: What do you need, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Salt. I was miming salt. It's salt. I need something salty. <br>
DONNA: What about this? <br>

DONNA: Salt. <br>

DOCTOR: A terrible day for all of us. The Professor struck down, Miss
Chandrakala taken cruelly from us, and yet we still take dinner. <br>
CLEMENCY: We are British, Doctor. What else must we do? <br>
DOCTOR: And then someone tried to poison me. Any one of you had the
chance to put cyanide in my drink. But it rather gave me an idea. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: And what would that be? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, poison. Drink up. I've laced the soup with pepper. <br>
CURBISHLEY: Ah, I thought it was jolly spicy. <br>
DOCTOR: But the active ingredient of pepper is piperine, traditionally
used as an insecticide. So, anyone got the shivers? <br>
(On cue, there is a crash of thunder and the windows blow open,

1926? It's more like the dark ages. <br>
AGATHA: Did you enquire after the necklace? <br>
DONNA: Lady Eddison bought it back from India. It's worth thousands. <br>
DOCTOR: This thing can sting, it can fly. It could wipe us all out in
seconds. Why is it playing this game? <br>
AGATHA: Every murder is essentially the same. They are committed
because somebody wants something. <br>
DOCTOR: What does a Vespiform want? <br>
AGATHA: Doctor, stop it. The murderer is as human as you or I. <br>
DOCTOR: You're right. Ah, I've been so caught up with giant wasps that
I've forgotten. You're the expert. <br>
AGATHA: I'm not. I told you. I'm just a purveyor of nonsense. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because plenty of people write
detective stories, but yours are the best. And why? Why are you so
good, Agatha Christie? Because you understand. You've lived, you've
fought, you've had your heart broken. You know about people. Their
passions, their hope, and despair, and anger. All of those tiny, huge
things that can turn the most ordinary person into a killer. Just
think, Agatha. If anyone can solve this, it's you. <br>
(Later, everyone is gathered for the traditional denouement.) <br>
DOCTOR: I've called you here on this <i>Endless Night</i>,
because we have a murderer in our midst. And when it comes to
detection, there's none finer. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you, Agatha
Christie. <br>
AGATHA: This is <i>A Crooked House</i>. A house of
secrets. To understand the solution, we must examine them all. Starting
with you, Miss Redmond. <br>
ROBINA: But I'm innocent, surely? <br>
AGATHA: You've never met these people, and these people have never met
you. I think the real Robina Redmond never left London. You're
impersonating her. <br>
ROBINA: How silly. What proof do you have? <br>
AGATHA: You said you'd been to the toilet. <br>
DONNA: Oh, I know this. If she was really posh, she'd say loo. <br>
(Agatha picks up the locksmith's case.) <br>
AGATHA: Earlier today, Miss Noble and I found this on the lawn, right
beneath your bathroom window. You must have heard that Miss Noble was
searching the bedrooms, so you panicked. You ran upstairs and disposed
of the evidence. <br>
ROBINA: I've never seen that thing before in my life. <br>
CLEMENCY: What's inside it? <br>
AGATHA: The tools of your trade, Miss Redmond. Or should I say, the
Unicorn. You came to this house with one sole intention. To steal the
Firestone. <br>
ROBINA: (Cockney) Oh, all right then. It's a fair cop. Yes, I'm the
bleeding Unicorn. Ever so nice to meet you, I don't think. I took my
chance in the dark and nabbed it. Go on then, you knobs. Arrest me.
Sling me in jail. <br>
(She throws the necklace to the Doctor.) <br>
DONNA: So, is she the murderer? <br>
ROBINA: Don't be so thick. I might be a thief, but, well, I ain't no
killer. <br>
AGATHA: Quite. There are darker motives at work. And in examining this
household, we come to you, Colonel. <br>
CURBISHLEY: Damn it, woman. You with your perspicacity. You've rumbled
me. <br>
(The Colonel stands up.) <br>
CLEMENCY: Hugh, you can walk. But why? <br>
CURBISHLEY: My darling, how else could I be certain of keeping you by
my side? <br>
CLEMENCY: I don't understand. <br>
CURBISHLEY: You're still a beautiful woman, Clemency. Sooner or later
some chap will turn your head. I couldn't bear that. Staying in the
chair was the only way I could be certain of keeping you. Confound it,
Mrs Christie, how did you discover the truth? <br>
AGATHA: Er, actually I had no idea. I was just going to say you're
completely innocent. <br>
CURBISHLEY: Oh. Oh. <br>
AGATHA: Sorry. <br>
CURBISHLEY: Well. Well, shall I sit down then? <br>
AGATHA: I think you better had. <br>
DONNA: So he's not the murderer. <br>
AGATHA: Indeed, not. To find the truth, let's return to this. (The
Firestone.) Far more than the Unicorn's object of desire. The Firestone
has quite a history. Lady Eddison. <br>
CLEMENCY: I've done nothing. <br>
AGATHA: You brought it back from India, did you not? Before you met the
Colonel. You came home with malaria, and confined yourself to this
house for six months, in a room that has been kept locked ever since,
which I rather think means <br>
CLEMENCY: Stop, please. <br>
AGATHA: I'm so sorry. But you had fallen pregnant in India. Unmarried
and ashamed, you hurried back to England with your confidante, a young
maid later to become housekeeper. Miss Chandrakala. <br>
CURBISHLEY: Clemency, is this true? <br>
CLEMENCY: My poor baby. I had to give him away. The shame of it. <br>
CURBISHLEY: But you never said a word. <br>
CLEMENCY: I had no choice. Imagine the scandal. The family name. I'm
British. I carry on. <br>
DOCTOR: And it was no ordinary pregnancy. <br>
CLEMENCY: How can you know that? <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me Agatha, this is my territory. But when you heard that
buzzing sound in the dining room, you said, it can't be. Why did you
say that? <br>
CLEMENCY: You'd never believe it. <br>
AGATHA: The Doctor has opened my mind to believe many things. <br>
CLEMENCY: It was forty years ago, in the heat of Delhi, late one night.
I was alone, and that's when I saw it. A dazzling light in the sky. The
next day, he came to the house. Christopher, the most handsome man I'd
ever seen. Our love blazed like a wildfire. I held nothing back. And in
return he showed me the incredible truth about himself. He'd made
himself human, to learn about us. This was his true shape. <br>
(A giant wasp.) <br>
CLEMENCY: I loved him so much, it didn't matter. But he was stolen from
me. 1885, the year of the great monsoon. The river Jumna rose up and
broke its banks. He was <i>Taken At The Flood</i>. But
Christopher left me a parting gift. A jewel like no other. I wore it
always. Part of me never forgot. I kept it close, always. <br>
ROBINA: Just like a man. Flashes his family jewels and you end up with
a bun in the oven. <br>
AGATHA: A poor little child. Forty years ago, Miss Chandrakala took
that newborn babe to an orphanage. But Professor Peach worked it out.
He found the birth certificate. <br>
DONNA: Oh, that's maiden. Maiden name. <br>
AGATHA: Precisely. <br>
DONNA: So she killed him? <br>
CLEMENCY: I did not. <br>
AGATHA: Miss Chandrakala feared that the Professor had unearthed your
secret. She was coming to warn you. <br>
DONNA: So she killed her. <br>
CLEMENCY: I did not. <br>
AGATHA: Lady Eddison is innocent. Because at this point, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. At this point, when we consider the lies and the
secrets, and the key to these events, then we have to consider it was
you, Donna Noble. <br>
DONNA: What? Who did I kill? <br>
DOCTOR: No, but you said it all along. The vital clue. This whole thing
is being acted out like a murder mystery, which means it was you,
Agatha Christie. <br>
AGATHA: I beg your pardon, sir? <br>
DONNA: So she killed them? <br>
DOCTOR: No. But she wrote. She wrote those brilliant, clever books. And
who's her greatest admirer? <i> The
Moving Finger</i> points at you, Lady Eddison. <br>
CLEMENCY: Don't. Leave me alone. <br>
DONNA: So she did kill them. <br>
DOCTOR: No. But just think. Last Thursday night, what were you doing? <br>
CLEMENCY: I was I was in the library. I was reading my favourite Agatha
Christie, (<i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i>) thinking
about her plots, and how clever she must be. How is that relevant? <br>
DOCTOR: Just think. What else happened on Thursday night? <br>
GOLIGHTLY: I'm sorry? <br>
DOCTOR: You said on the lawn, this afternoon. Last Thursday night,
those boys broke into your church. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: That's correct. They did. I discovered the two of them.
Thieves in the night. I was most perturbed. <br>
GOLIGHTLY [memory]: What the blazes are you doing, boys? <br>
(The young thieves laugh at him.) <br>
GOLIGHTLY: But I apprehended them. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? A man of God against two strong lads? A man in his
forties? Or, should I say forty years old, exactly? <br>
CLEMENCY: Oh, my God. <br>
DOCTOR: Lady Eddison, your child, how old would he be now? <br>
CLEMENCY: Forty. He's forty. <br>
DOCTOR: Your child has come home. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Oh, this is poppycock. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? You said you were taught by the Christian Fathers, meaning
you were raised in an orphanage. <br>
CLEMENCY: My son. Can it be? <br>
DOCTOR: You found those thieves, Reverend, and you got angry. A proper,
deep anger, for the first time in your life, and it broke the genetic
lock. You changed. <br>
GOLIGHTLY [memory]: Put thozz thingzz back where you found them.
It'zzzz <br>
(A purple glow and the thieves stop laughing.) <br>
DOCTOR: You realised your inheritance. After all these years, you knew
who you were. Oh, and then it all kicks off, because this isn't just a
jewel. It's a Vespiform telepathic recorder. It's part of you, your
brain, your very essence. And when you activated, so did the Firestone.
It beamed your full identity directly into your mind. And, at the same
time, it absorbed the works of Agatha Christie directly from Lady
Eddison. It all became part of you. The mechanics of those novels
formed a template in your brain. You've killed, in this pattern,
because that's what you think the world is. It turns out, we are in the
middle of a murder mystery. One of yours, Dame Agatha. <br>
AGATHA: Dame? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Sorry, not yet. <br>
DONNA: So he killed them, yes? Definitely? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Well, this has certainly been a most entertaining evening.
Really, you can't believe any of this surely, Lady Edizzon. <br>
DOCTOR: Lady who? <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Lady Edizzzzon. <br>
DOCTOR: Little bit of buzzing there, Vicar. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Don't make me angry. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? What happens then? <br>
GOLIGHTLY: Damn it, you humanzz, worshipping your tribal sky godzz. I
am so much more. That night, the universe exploded in my mind. I wanted
to take what wazz mine. And you, Agatha Christie, with your railway
station bookstall romancezz, what'z to stop me killing you? <br>
CLEMENCY: Oh, my dear God. My child. <br>
GOLIGHTLY: What'zz to stop me killing you all? <br>
(The Reverend transforms into the wasp.) <br>
CLEMENCY: Forgive me. <br>
CURBISHLEY: No, no, Clemency, come back. Keep away. Keep away, my
darling. <br>
AGATHA: No. No more murder. If my imagination made you kill, then my
imagination will find a way to stop you, foul creature. <br>

follow her.)

work. <br>
AGATHA: Just one mystery left, Doctor. Who exactly are you? <br>
(Suddenly Agatha doubles over in pain.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's the Firestone. It's part of the Vespiform's mind. It's
dying and it's connected to Agatha. <br>
(Agatha glows purple for a few moments.) <br>
DOCTOR: He let her go. Right at the end, the Vespiform chose to save
someone's life. <br>
DONNA: Is she all right, though? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. The amnesia. Wiped her mind of everything that
happened. The wasp, the murders. <br>
DONNA: And us. She'll forget about us. <br>

Christie. And tomorrow morning, her car gets found by the side of a

Unicorn does a bunk back to London town. She can never even say she was
there. <br>
DONNA: What happens to Agatha? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, great life. Met another man, married again. Saw the world.

DOCTOR: And, where is it, where is it, hold on. Here we go. <br>

not all. Look at the copyright page. <br>
DONNA: Facsimile edition, published in the year five billion! <br>
DOCTOR: People never stop reading them. She is the best selling
novelist of all time. <br>
DONNA: But she never knew. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no one knows how they're going to be remembered. All we
