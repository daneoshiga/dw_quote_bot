the console room. A grey haired space hobo in tartan trousers speaks to
his companion, who is wearing a kilt. Yes, Patrick Troughton and Fraser
Hines are back. This is going to be fun.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Come here, Jamie. Look at that. <br>
(The picture turns to colour as they gaze at the huge city in space on
the scanner.) <br>
JAMIE: Look at the size of that thing, Doctor.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, Jamie. It is a big one. <br>
JAMIE: Just a wee laboratory, eh? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Well, it's, obviously, it's grown. <br>
JAMIE: It's like twenty castles in the sky! Are you sure we've come to
the right place? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Of course I am. <br>
JAMIE: We don't usually get to where you say we're going. <br>
DOCTOR 2: I got Victoria to where she wanted to go, though why she
wants to learn graphology, I've no idea. <br>
JAMIE: Ah. Will we ever get back to her, though? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Of course we will. <br>
JAMIE: I'll believe that when I see it. <br>
DOCTOR 2: At the moment, we have other things to worry about. Look at
this! <br>
JAMIE: What? <br>
(There is a round item embedded in the console.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, I've not seen that before. <br>
DOCTOR 2: It's not been here before. It's a teleport control. You'd
think I'd never flown a Tardis solo! <br>
(The Doctor shouts at the ceiling.) <br>
JAMIE: What's it do? <br>
DOCTOR 2: It gives the Time Lords dual control. Infernal cheek. I shall
complain when this is over. Now then, I think we'll just dematerialise
to avoid their detection beams, and slip in quietly. <br>
JAMIE: Er, I thought you said they were friendly. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Friendly? I should think they'll be overwhelmingly so. <br>
JAMIE: Then why are we slipping in quietly? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Jamie, some of the most brilliant scientists in the universe
have assembled here to work together in pure research. I don't want
them to know that I've arrived. <br>
JAMIE: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Think of the commotion! They'll all be scrambling around
wanting my autograph. No, no, no, I just want a quiet word with old
Dastari, Head of Projects. <br>
(The Doctor oils a lever.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Right then. <br>
(He pushes the lever with all its strength. It creaks ominously then
jerks into place. The Tardis shudders.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Splendid! We've hit conterminous time again. <br>
JAMIE: Well, we've certainly hit something. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Now, Jamie. Right, follow me. <br>
(They head for the doors.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Wait. <br>
JAMIE: What? What? <br>
DOCTOR 2: We'd better take the recall disk. <br>
(The Doctor takes an object from inside the new remote control.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: And Jamie? Don't go wandering off. Stay with me. <br>
JAMIE: Do I ever? <br>
DOCTOR 2: It has been known. And, er, let me do the talking. <br>
(This time the Doctor opens the doors.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: All you have to do is to stand in the background, and admire
my <br>

A red-haired chef with impressive eyebrows and various cutlery hanging
from his tool belt approaches. The Doctor and Jamie come out.) <br>
SHOCKEYE: How dare you! How dare you transmat that object into my
kitchens? <br>
DOCTOR 2: How dare you have the impertinence to address me like that? <br>
(Shockeye gets a large carving knife.) <br>
SHOCKEYE: I am Shockeye, o' the Quauncing Grig! <br>
DOCTOR 2: I'm not interested in the pedigree of an Androgum.&nbsp;<br>
SHOCKEYE: Stay! <br>
DOCTOR 2: I am a Time Lord. <br>
SHOCKEYE: Oh. Oh, I. My humblest apologies. I should have realised. <br>
(Still holding on to the large knife, Shockeye bows. The Doctor feels
along the table behind him for an equal weapon and finds - a cucumber.)
<br>
SHOCKEYE: But this one with you? <br>
DOCTOR 2: He is from the planet Earth. A human. <br>
SHOCKEYE: A Tellurian? Oh! I have not seen one of these before. Is it a
gift for Dastari? <br>
DOCTOR 2: A gift? <br>
SHOCKEYE: Oh, such a soft white skin, whispering of a tender
succulence. Dastari will not appreciate its qualities, you know. He has
no sensual refinement. Let me buy it from you. <br>
DOCTOR 2: My companion is not for sale! <br>
SHOCKEYE: I promise you lord, no chef in the nine planets would do more
to bring out the flavour of the beast. <br>
(The Doctor waves his 'weapon' at Shockeye.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: You get on with your butchery. Come along, Jamie. <br>
(Jamie circles Shockeye, not turning his back, and follows the Doctor
out.) <br>
SHOCKEYE: Oh. Oh. I can just taste that flesh. <br>
(Shockeye swings a cleaver into a small carcase on the block.)

JAMIE: Who was that? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Shockeye of the Quauncing Grig, so he said. <br>
JAMIE: I know what he said, but <br>
DOCTOR 2: He's an Androgum, Jamie. The Androgums are the servitors
here. They do all the station maintenance. <br>
JAMIE: Ah, you mean a scullion. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, with a high opinion of himself. Chefs usually have. <br>
(The sound of a Tardis in motion makes them turn around.) <br>
JAMIE: It's the Tardis!

CHESSENE: Our allies won't care for that. I promised the Group Marshal
he could have the Time Lord's machine. <br>
SHOCKEYE: Will it make any difference? <br>
CHESSENE: Not to me. I still have the Kartz-Reimer module. But it shows
the Gallifreyans are suspicious, so I was right to lay the plans I did.
<br>
SHOCKEYE: So now we wait. <br>
CHESSENE: Not for long. Stike is moving. <br>
SHOCKEYE: Already? The calgesic won't have affected the scientists yet.
<br>
CHESSENE: It will by the time Stike's forces arrive. <br>
SHOCKEYE: Ah. Did they enjoy the meal? <br>
CHESSENE: Dastari said you had surpassed yourself. <br>
SHOCKEYE: Oh! Being unable to taste it, I worried that it might be
over-seasoned. <br>
CHESSENE: Shockeye, their last supper would have added lustre to your
reputation. <br>
SHOCKEYE: Oh. <br>
CHESSENE: Except that they won't live to remember it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A grey-haired man in spectacles and plasticised
jumpsuit sits behind a grand wooden desk.) <br>
DASTARI: I remember it very clearly, Doctor. You came to our
inauguration, bearing fraternal greetings from Gallifrey. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, yes. That was before I, er, fell from favour. I'm a bit
of an exile these days. <br>
DASTARI: Yes, I heard something about that. But you still act on their
instructions. <br>
DOCTOR 2: It's the price I pay for my freedom. <br>
DASTARI: Needless to say, we've had no support at all from your people.
<br>
DOCTOR 2: Oh, Dastari, you can't have expected help from the Time
Lords. Their policy is one of strict neutrality. <br>
DASTARI: Nonetheless, there's been widespread disappointment among the
other Third Zone governments. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Don't chide me, Dastari. I'm simply a messenger. Officially,
I'm here quite unofficially. <br>
DASTARI: You'll explain that paradox, I know. <br>
DOCTOR 2: I'm a pariah, exiled from Time Lord society, so they can
always deny sending me. <br>
DASTARI: And why have they sent you? <br>
DOCTOR 2: They have been monitoring the experiments in time travel of
the Professors Kartz and Reimer. They want them stopped. <br>
DASTARI: I see And how do the Time Lords equate that with a policy of
complete neutrality? <br>
DOCTOR 2: They don't have to. As I said, I have no official existence,
so they can always deny sending me. <br>
DASTARI: Oh, typical. Typical hypocrisy. <br>
(Chessene enters.) <br>
DASTARI: Yes, Chessene? <br>
CHESSENE: I wondered if your guests require refreshment, Professor. <br>
JAMIE: Ah, well, er <br>
DOCTOR 2: No, thank you. We've already eaten. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, but that was yesterday. <br>
DOCTOR 2: One meal a day is quite sufficient, Jamie. <br>
DASTARI: Are you sure? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes. <br>
DASTARI: Thank you, Chessene. <br>
CHESSENE: Very good, Professor. <br>
(Chessene leaves.) <br>
DASTARI: Well, Doctor, what did you make of our chatelaine? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Was she an Androgum? <br>
DASTARI: She was. Now she's an Androgum TA. Technologically augmented. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Oh, one of your biological experiments. <br>
DASTARI: I've carried out nine augmentations on Chessene. She's at
mega-genius level now. I'm very proud of her. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Proud of her, or your own skill? <br>
DASTARI: Perhaps a little of both, but all that Androgum energy is now
functioning on a higher plane. She spends days in the databanks simply
sucking in knowledge. <br>
DOCTOR 2: She's still an Androgum. You can't change nature. <br>
DASTARI: In Chessene's case, I believe I have. <br>
DOCTOR 2: That's dangerous ground, Dastari. You give a monkey control
of its environment, it'll fill the world with bananas. <br>
DASTARI: Oh really, Doctor. I expected something more progressive from
you. Don't you understand the tremendous implications of my work? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, that's why I say it's so dangerous! <br>
DASTARI: Doctor, our races have become tired and effete. Our seed is
thin. We must hand the baton of progress to others. If I can raise the
Androgums to a higher plane of consciousness, there's no limit to what
that boiling energy might achieve. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Dastari, I have no doubt you could augment an earwig to the
point where it understood nuclear physics, but it'd still be a very
stupid thing to do!

Guadiamar in Andalucía, but is pretending to be somewhere rather alien
where the Doctor is fishing with rod and line.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't do that! You'll frighten the fish. <br>
(Peri tosses in another stone. Plop!) <br>
PERI: What fish? Doctor, I'm bored. We've been here for hours. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I think it was Rassilon who once said, there are few
ways in which a Time Lord can be more innocently occupied, then in
catching fish. <br>
PERI: That's a whopper. <br>
DOCTOR: Where? I don't see one. <br>
PERI: It was Doctor Johnson who said that, about money. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what's the use of a good quotation if you can't change
it? <br>
PERI: Anyway, you're not innocently employed in catching fish, are you?
<br>
DOCTOR: They're just lazy today. Any angler will tell you there are
times when nothing will tempt them. <br>
PERI: That so? <br>
DOCTOR: The last time I fished this particular stretch, I landed four
magnificent gumblejack in less than ten minutes. <br>
PERI: Gumblejack? <br>
DOCTOR: The finest fish in this galaxy, probably the universe. Cleaned,
skinned, quickly pan-fried in their own juices till they're golden
brown. Ambrosia steeped in nectar, Peri. The flavour is unforgettable.
I think I've got a bite! <br>
PERI: At last. <br>
DOCTOR: That's it, yes. Give him his head. <br>
PERI: You really caught something? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. My word, this fellow's putting up a fight. Stand by with
the gaff, Peri. <br>
PERI: I'm not sticking that thing in a poor little fish. <br>
DOCTOR: Not so little, Peri. Not so little at all. By the feel of this,
it might be a record. <br>
(The Doctor reels a tiny little thing to the surface.) <br>
PERI: Oh, wow, Doctor. That must weigh very nearly an ounce. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes.. but did you see the one that got away? That magnificent
gumblejack that was trying to eat this poor little fellow. There. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DASTARI: Even if I wanted to, Doctor, I have no
authority to order Professors Kartz and Reimer to abandon their work. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Of course you have. You sanction all the experiments on this
station. <br>
DASTARI: And what reason would I give? That the Time Lords have
expressed concern? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Dastari, our monitors have already detected ripples of up to
point four on the Bocher scale. Anything much higher would threaten the
whole fabric of time! <br>
DASTARI: They are well aware of the dangers, Doctor. They are
responsible scientists. <br>
DOCTOR 2: They're incompetent meddlers. <br>
DASTARI: Aren't you being a little ingenuous, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR 2: What do you mean? <br>
DASTARI: Hasn't it occurred to you that the Time Lords have a vested
interest in ensuring that others do not discover their secrets? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Oh, I'm sure that's not the case. <br>
DASTARI: I gather your own machine is no longer in the station. Isn't
that because you didn't want Kartz and Reimer to get a look at it? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Look, I've a suggestion. Stop these experiments for the time
being, whilst my people study their work. If Kartz and Reimer really
are on safe lines, I'm sure they'll be allowed to continue. <br>
DASTARI: Allowed to continue? <br>
DOCTOR 2: I mean, there would be no further objection. <br>
DASTARI: In the first place, I have no authority to ask Kartz and
Reimer to submit their work for analysis. And in the second place, the
Time Lords have no right to make such a grossly unethical demand. I've
never heard such unmitigated arrogance! <br>
DOCTOR 2: And I've never heard such specious claptrap! Oh, don't you
prate to me about ethics! The balance of the space-time continuum could
be destroyed by your ham-fisted numbskulls. <br>
(Dastari looks very unwell.) <br>
DASTARI: I don't feel there's anything to be gained by prolonging this
discussion, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Dastari, you have more letters after your name than anyone I
know. Enough for two alphabets. How is it you can be such a stupid,
stubborn, irrational, and thoroughly objectionable old idiot? <br>
(Jamie nearly laughs.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: And what are you smiling at, you, you hairy-legged
Highlander? <br>
JAMIE: I'm just admiring your diplomatic skills. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Pah! Dastari? <br>
(Dastari is slumped across his desk.) <br>
JAMIE: He's got his head doon, Doctor. I can't say I blame him. <br>
DOCTOR 2: I'll thank you not to speak in that appalling mongrel
dialect. <br>
JAMIE: I mean, he's gone to sleep. <br>
DOCTOR 2: He's no' asleep. <br>
JAMIE: Ah! <br>
DOCTOR 2: He's not asleep Jamie. He's drugged! <br>
JAMIE: He's what? <br>
(Energy weapons are fired nearby.) <br>
JAMIE: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR 2: I would have thought a Jacobite would recognise that sound. <br>
(A man in a lab coat runs in.) <br>
SCIENTIST: Professor! <br>
(And is immediately killed by an energy beam. Smoke starts to pour in.)

DOCTOR 2: Jamie, run. <br>

conga, it's longer than your railway trains. <br>
PERI: I don't think I wish to know. What is all this fishing stuff,

CHESSENE: It's unimportant. <br>
SHOCKEYE: Earth? <br>
CHESSENE: If you wish. But why Earth? <br>
SHOCKEYE: I have a desire to taste one of these human beasts, madam.
The meat looks so white and roundsomely layered on the bone, a sure
sign of a tasty animal. <br>
CHESSENE: You think of nothing but your stomach, do you, Shockeye. <br>
SHOCKEYE: The gratification of pleasure is the sole motive of action.
Is that not our law? <br>
CHESSENE: I still accept it, but there are pleasures other than the
purely sensual. <br>
SHOCKEYE: For you, perhaps. Fortunately, I have not been augmented. <br>
CHESSENE: Take care. Your purity could easily become insufferable. <br>
SHOCKEYE: These days, you no longer use your karam name, do you,
Chessene o' the Franzine Grig?&nbsp;<br>

weakness and then I, I was in another place. <br>
PERI: Can I get you anything? Celery! That's what you need. <br>
DOCTOR: Celery, yes. And the tensile strength of jelly babies! But I, I
had a clarinet. Or was it a flute? Something you blew into. <br>
PERI: A glass of water? <br>
DOCTOR: Water? No, don't think so. A recorder! That's what it was. Some

didn't end like that, so it's not possible. <br>
PERI: What isn't possible? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I exist. I'm here, now, therefore I cannot have been
killed then. That is irrefutable logic, isn't it? <br>
PERI: Don't worry about it. <br>
DOCTOR: But the there and then subsumes the here and now, so if I was
killed then, I could only exist now as some sort of temporal tautology.
That also is irrefutable. <br>
PERI: Circular logic will only make you dizzy, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: The most likely explanation, of course, is that I haven't
synchronised properly yet. Some kind of time-slip in the subconscious. <br>
PERI: Perhaps you should see a doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you trying to be funny? <br>

cards.) <br>

Space Station Chimera, Third Zone. That's him! <br>

DOCTOR: Dastari! The pioneer of genetic engineering. Be worth a trip,
anyway. Dastari's people are doing some fascinating work on Rho mesons
as the unstable factor in pin galaxies. <br>
PERI: I can hardly wait. What are pin galaxies? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, they're galaxies within the universe of the atom.
Difficult to study. They only exist for one attosecond. <br>
PERI: Doctor, I have no idea what that means. <br>

PERI: Do you think we should go on any further? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
PERI: Well, I mean, if there's no one left alive, there's nothing we
can do now, is there? <br>
DOCTOR: I want to find out what happened here. Look, you can go back to
the Tardis if you like. <br>
PERI: No, I'll stay with you. <br>
DOCTOR: When I first saw this station, I thought of comet strike, or
some such natural disaster, but it's been deliberately destroyed! Now,
what kind of monster would want to stop the brilliant work that was
being done here? Pure research, for its own sake, It threatened no one.
<br>
COMPUTER: It threatened the Time Lords. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you care to repeat that? <br>
COMPUTER: It threatened the Time Lords. <br>
DOCTOR: And what put that idea into your apology for a brain? <br>
COMPUTER: Return to your ship and leave. <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly not. <br>
COMPUTER: Then this station will switch to defence alert. <br>
DOCTOR: I will not be threatened by a computer. And put some lights on!
<br>
PERI: How do you know it's a computer? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear girl, I know a computer when I talk to one. Come on. <br>
PERI: And what did it mean, defence alert? <br>
DOCTOR: (sighs) The usual. Floor trips, electronic sensors, death rays,
jets of nerve gas. Nothing to worry about. <br>
PERI: Oh, good. I was afraid it might mean something serious. <br>
DOCTOR: As long as we keep our wits about us. <br>
(The Doctor steps over an electronic eye. Peri follows and a klaxon
sounds.) <br>
PERI: What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: It's depressurising this section. Got to get out of here. No
power. <br>
PERI: It's getting colder! <br>
DOCTOR: It will, but we'll die from lack of air before we freeze to
death. <br>
(No wall control panels work.) <br>
PERI: How long? <br>
DOCTOR: Not many minutes. We've got to get out of this passageway. <br>

PERI: Thanks. Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Dastari's office. <br>
PERI: How do you know? <br>
DOCTOR: He liked old familiar things around him. He worked out the
famous theory of parallel matter at that desk. And in pen and ink. He
detested computers. <br>
PERI: You speak as though you're sure he's dead. <br>
DOCTOR: They're all dead, Peri. Forty of the finest scientific minds
ever assembled in one place. The barbarity of such a deed, I find
scarcely conceivable. <br>
PERI: Were they a threat to the Time Lords? <br>
DOCTOR: Absolute rubbish. This institute was a threat to no one. It's
only purpose was to add to the sum total of knowledge. <br>
PERI: Well, then why did the computer say that <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't know. Not yet. Programmed to say that, presumably. <br>
(The lights come on.) <br>
PERI: What's that for? <br>
DOCTOR: Switching to visual. Must have lost track of us. <br>
PERI: Well, I haven't seen any lenses. <br>
DOCTOR: There'll be an electronic eye somewhere. Do you notice the

PERI: What about it? <br>
DOCTOR: Cork insulation and carpet. <br>
PERI: So your friend liked to be comfortable, even in space. <br>
DOCTOR: It's been tracking us by the heat of our feet. In here, it
couldn't detect us. <br>
PERI: You mean it got worried and switched the lights on? <br>
DOCTOR: Something like that. I wonder what it'll try next. <br>
PERI: You don't think it'll just leave us alone? <br>
DOCTOR: Most unlikely. Think of it as a game, between it and us. <br>
(The Doctor sits in Dastari's chair and looks at his journal.) <br>
PERI: I love games, Doctor. Games where I'm not expecting to end up
dead. Are you listening? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. My word, they were doing some fascinating work here. This
is Dastari's day journal. <br>
PERI: You've told me all I want to know about pin galaxies. <br>
DOCTOR: Some people called Kartz and Reimer were having some success,
it seems, with experiments in time control. <br>
PERI: But you can already do that. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can, yes, but I didn't realise the Third Zoners were
that close to, to the breakthrough. <br>
PERI: Is something wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: This last entry. The Time Lords are demanding that Kartz and
Reimer suspend their work, alleging their experiments are imperiling
the continuum. No proof was offered to support this charge, so I
rejected the demand. Colleagues fear they may forcibly intervene? All
agreed that we must stand firm and refuse to be intimidated. <br>
PERI: So it was the Time Lords. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's not possible! No matter how dangerous the experiments
they were doing, they'd have found some other way of halting them. Not
this massacre. <br>
PERI: Well, maybe they couldn't find another way. <br>
DOCTOR: No! It's unbelievable that they would commit such an atrocity.
The use of force is alien to Time Lord nature. <br>
PERI: Well, perhaps they thought the ends justified the means. Isn't
that always the excuse for something really bad? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I won't believe it. There must be some other explanation. <br>
PERI: Well, maybe someone's setting the Time Lords up. <br>
DOCTOR: Setting them up? Setting, setting them up. You know, sometimes,
young Peri, you make amazingly shrewd remarks. Yes. It could be a crude
attempt to drive a wedge between Gallifrey and the Third Zone
governments. <br>
PERI: But who'd benefit from that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I intend to find out. <br>
PERI: That's if we get out of here alive. <br>
DOCTOR: Hm? Oh, yes, I was forgetting that. We still have our homicidal
computer to deal with. <br>
PERI: It's getting awfully hot and stuffy in here now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Having failed to freeze us to death, it's now trying to
bake us. It appears to be a machine with a distinctly limited
repertoire. <br>
PERI: Who needs anything fancy? Oh Doctor, we've got to get out of
here. <br>
DOCTOR: We have to do better than that. We've got to find our way to
the control centre and turn the wretched thing off. <br>
PERI: Well, how're we going to do that without being zapped on the way?
<br>
DOCTOR: Zapped? We'll have to find our way down into the infrastructure
and work our way across. We'll be cramped down there, but safer than
going on the walkways. <br>
(The Doctor rummages through Dastari's desk drawers.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not so much as a paper clip! You'd think someone like Dastari
would keep a few useful odds and ends around. <br>
PERI: Oh, Doctor, it's absolutely stifling now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it is a bit uncomfortable. <br>
(The Doctor takes the centre from a wall panel. There is machinery
behind it.) <br>
DOCTOR: As I thought. I could trip this if I had a bit of
wire.&nbsp;<br>
PERI: Well, what are you trying to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Save us from death by dehydration. That computer's been forced
to turn the power on, but it hasn't energized the door locks. If only I
could. Ah ha! Here you are. <br>
(He gives Peri the banana from his pocket and goes to a sculpture with
a fine wire detail.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now. <br>

control with it. The door opens.) <br>

were just two great fingers. They killed everyone. <br>
(Jamie suddenly sits up.) <br>
JAMIE: They killed the Doctor! I saw them! <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. It's all right, Jamie. Now sleep. Sleep.

DOCTOR: Frame? <br>
PERI: Make them appear guilty when they weren't. <br>

They probably thought the Third Zoners were getting too powerful and

fighting each other across the galaxy for so long they've almost
forgotten what started it. Ah, there's the Kartz and Reimer work. <br>
(Peri looks at herself in a reflective wall panel.) <br>
PERI: Oh, I look a mess. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, you can understand the Time Lords wanting to monitor
their experiments. If the holistic fabric of time were ever punctured,
it'd be like putting a pin into a balloon. The Universe would simply
collapse. <br>
PERI: Doctor, shall I go and see if Jamie's okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Peri, it's possible! <br>
PERI: What? <br>
DOCTOR: That I was killed! It's why I collapsed, the weakness that I
felt. <br>
PERI: But you said you couldn't be dead then and here now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but if I arrived here during a time experiment, caught in
an embolism and therefore outside the time flow. But if I were dead
then and here now, it means that I was at the very epicentre of the
engulfing chaos. <br>
PERI: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: It means the collapse of the universe has started and nothing

Dastari, then the second Doctor, and back to Peri, Dastari, the sixth

DOCTOR: Life like, isn't it? Or rather, death like. <br>
(He turns it off.) <br>
JAMIE: But that's how they killed the Doctor. I saw it. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think they did, Jamie. I'm beginning to understand,
now. They left this illusion to make it appear that I was dead. <br>
PERI: Who? <br>
DOCTOR: The Sontarans. They wanted to prevent any investigation into my
disappearance, which means I must have been held captive somewhere. <br>
PERI: But why am I in it? <br>
DOCTOR: That was their mistake. They left the animator switched on.
When you looked into that, it copied your body print. <br>
JAMIE: So you don't think the Doctor's dead? I mean, my Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don't, Jamie. And if I'm not dead in that form, it means
my theory about the embolism is also wrong. Well, this begins to have
all the hallmarks of a conspiracy. <br>
PERI: What sort of conspiracy? <br>
JAMIE: A plot. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right, Jamie. A plot to kidnap me and Dastari as well.
And he's about the only bio-geneticist in the galaxy capable of
isolating the symbiotic nuclei of a Time Lord. <br>
PERI: So that's how you control the Tardis. Symbiosis. <br>
DOCTOR: If the Sontarans ever get unlimited access to time travel,
they'll be invincible. We must find out where they're holding me. <br>
JAMIE: How could we do that? They could be anywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: I made contact with myself before during that mind-slip. I'll
try telepathy. It's about our only chance. <br>
(The Doctor lies down on a bench.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, I shall seem to be unconscious for a while, but don't
worry. And while my mind is out of my body, don't touch me. Don't come
anywhere near me. Any kind of contact might sever the astral link and
kill me. <br>
PERI: How long will you be? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, seconds, hours, days. Who knows? There's no such thing
as time on the astral plane. <br>

DASTARI: It worked well enough to bring you to the Space Station,
Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR 2: All it did was to produce a few hiccups in the time
continuum. Enough to tell us that dangerously crude experiments were
going on. <br>
DASTARI: Kartz and Reimer were clearly on the right track. Several
Androgums successfully vanished into time during those experiments.
Unfortunately we were unable to bring them back. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Course you couldn't. No one can travel through time without a
molecular stabilisation system. <br>

symbiotic link with their machines which protects them, and anyone with
them, against destabilisation. <br>

behind Kartz and Reimer, and it was she who first realised that the

DOCTOR 2: When did you go mad, Dastari? <br>
DASTARI: I assure you I am not at all mad. <br>

Time is being wasted. <br>
DASTARI: Time is not being wasted. An operation of this complexity
needs careful preparation. <br>
STIKE: You are not efficient. All that should have been done. <br>
DASTARI: We brought most of this equipment with us. How could it have
been installed before we got here? <br>
STIKE: Chessene should have brought it. There was no forward planning. <br>
DASTARI: If we had dismantled my operating theatre any earlier, the
station would have been buzzing with speculation. Chessene's plan might
have failed. It was not worth the risk. <br>
STIKE: How long is this operation going to take? <br>
DASTARI: As long as it takes me to locate the symbiotic nuclei within
the Time Lord's cell structure. Hours or days. I cannot say. <br>
STIKE: Every hour is precious to me, Dastari. My Ninth group is now
forming up for a vital battle in the Madillon Cluster. If successful,
it could change the course of the war, so it is imperative that I must
be there to lead them to victory. <br>
DASTARI: Then if time is so important, I suggest you take this to the
operating theatre while I fetch the rest of my equipment. <br>

are quite enough in my opinion. <br>

agree, Carema, Brillat Savaran, the noble Escoffier, they all agree
that one should begin with a light dish, something to bring relish to
the appetite. Pate du foie gras de Strasburg on croute, for instance,

DOCTOR 2: Molecular disintegration. Horrible. <br>
PERI: That's it then. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, except for that Shockeye. <br>
(The sixth Doctor limps in.) <br>
DOCTOR: He's been, er, mothballed. My word, that's a mess! It'll take
you a while to put that back together again! <br>
DOCTOR 2: That will not be necessary. <br>
(The second Doctor holds up a small thin device. The sixth Doctor makes
a grab for it.) <br>
DOCTOR: A Stattenheim remote control? Where did you get that? I've
always wanted one of those. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Some of us have earned these little privileges. <br>
(The second Doctor whistles and the Tardis materialises nearby. The
Doctor opens the door.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Er, after you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR 2: No, after you, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Goodbye, Peri. <br>
PERI: Bye. <br>
(Jamie and Peri shake hands, then Jamie kisses her on the cheek.) <br>
JAMIE: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie. Keep an eye on the old gentleman, will you? <br>
(Jamie enters the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's
a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of
us. Just. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know, I think I preferred you as an Androgum. <br>
(The Second Doctor enters the Tardis. It dematerialises.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Of all the conceited ingrates! Do you
know, he almost succeeded in concealing my natural charm. <br>
PERI: Was that your Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>
PERI: I don't understand. How can it be in two places at the same time?
<br>
DOCTOR: That's the whole point. It's not in two places at the same
time. My Tardis is at least five minutes walk from here. After you. <br>
PERI: No, after you. <br>
DOCTOR: No, After you. <br>
PERI: Doctor? We're not going fishing again, are we? <br>
DOCTOR: No. From now on it's a healthy vegetarian diet for both of us. </font>
