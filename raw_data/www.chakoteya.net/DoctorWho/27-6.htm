carpeting and display cases.) <br>
ROSE: So what is it? What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't know. Some kind of signal drawing the Tardis off course. <br>
ROSE: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Earth. Utah, North America. About half a mile underground. <br>
ROSE: And when are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Two thousand and twelve. <br>
(He looks at a display case.) <br>
ROSE: God, that's so close. So I should be twenty six. <br>
(The Doctor finds the light switch, and things become more clear.) <br>
ROSE: Blimey. It's a great big museum. <br>
DOCTOR: An alien museum. Someone's got a hobby. They must have spent a
fortune on this. Chunks of meteorite, moon dust. That's the milometer
from the Roswell spaceship. <br>
ROSE: That's a bit of Slitheen! That's a Slitheen's arm. It's been
stuffed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, look at you. <br>
ROSE: What is it? <br>
(The head of a Cyberman.) <br>
DOCTOR: An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares
reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. <br>
ROSE: Is that where the signal's coming from?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: No, it's stone dead. The signal's alive. Something's reaching
out, calling for help. <br>
(The Doctor touches the display case and an alarm goes off. Armed
guards rush in from all sides and cut them off from the Tardis.) <br>
ROSE: If someone's collecting aliens, that makes you Exhibit A. </font></p>

descending. Bad Wolf One descending. <br>
(A helicopter has landed. Four armed guards line the corridor as a man
and his aides stride out of a doorway.) <br>
POLKOWSKI: On behalf of all of us, I want to wish you a very happy
birthday, sir. And the President called to convey his personal best
wishes. <br>
VAN STATTEN: The President is ten points down. I want him replaced. <br>
POLKOWSKI: I don't think that's very wise, sir. <br>
VAN STATTEN: Thank you so much for your opinion. You're fired. Get rid
of him. <br>
POLKOWSKI: What? <br>
(An armed guard drags Polkowski away.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: Wipe his memory, put him on the road someplace. Memphis,
Minneapolis. Somewhere beginning with M. <br>
(A woman runs up to take Polkowski's place.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: So, the next President. What do you think? Republican or
Democrat? <br>
GODDARD: Democrat, sir. <br>
VAN STATTEN: For what reason? <br>
GODDARD: They're just so funny, sir? <br>
(Van Statten stops.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: What is your name? <br>
GODDARD: Goddard, sir. Diana Goddard. <br>
VAN STATTEN: I like you, Diana Goddard. So, where's the English kid? <br>
ADAM: Sir! Sir! I bought ten more artefacts at auction, Mister Van
Statten. <br>
VAN STATTEN: Bring 'em on, let me see 'em. <br>
GODDARD: Sir, with respect, there's something more urgent. We arrested
two intruders fifty three floors down. We don't know how they got in. <br>
VAN STATTEN: I'll tell you how they got in. In-tru-da window. In-tru-da
window. That was funny! <br>
(Obedient laughter.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: Bring 'em in. Let's see 'em. And tell Simmons I want to
visit my little
pet. Get to it! <br>
(Van Statten goes through a doorway. Goddard steps aside to use her
headset.) <br>
GODDARD: Simmons? You'd better give me good news. Is it talking? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Adam is showing his boss the latest purchases.) <br>
ADAM: And this is the last. Paid eight hundred thousand dollars for it.
<br>
(The Doctor, Rose and Goddard enter.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: What does it do? <br>
ADAM: Well, you see the tubes on the side? It must be to channel
something. I think maybe fuel. <br>
DOCTOR: I really wouldn't hold it like that. <br>
GODDARD: Shut it. <br>
DOCTOR: Really, though, that's wrong. <br>
ADAM: Is it dangerous? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it just looks silly. <br>
(The Doctor reaches for the item, and firing bolts click all around
him. Van Stratton hands him the curved, palm sized object.) <br>
DOCTOR: You just need to be <br>
(The Doctor strokes the artefact and it makes a note.) <br>
DOCTOR: Delicate. <br>
(He plays several different notes.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: It's a musical instrument. <br>
DOCTOR: And it's a long way from home. <br>
VAN STATTEN: Here, let me. <br>
(Van Statten's touch is harsher. Not nice sounds are produced.) <br>
DOCTOR: I did say delicate. It reacts to the smallest fingerprint. It
needs precision. <br>
(Van Statten finally gets the hang of it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Very good. Quite the expert. <br>
VAN STATTEN: As are you. <br>
(Van Statton casually tosses it aside, onto the floor.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: Who exactly are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. And who are you? <br>
VAN STATTEN: Like you don't know. We're hidden away with the most
valuable collection of extra-terrestrial artefacts in the world, and
you just stumbled in by mistake. <br>
DOCTOR: Pretty much sums me up, yeah. <br>
VAN STATTEN: The question is, how did you get in? Fifty three floors
down, with your little cat burglar accomplice. You're quite a collector
yourself, she's rather pretty.&nbsp;<br>
ROSE: She's going to smack you if you keep calling her she. <br>
VAN STATTEN: She's English too! Hey, little Lord Fauntleroy. Got you a
girlfriend. <br>
ADAM: This is Mister Henry Van Statten. <br>
ROSE: And who's he when he's at home? <br>
ADAM: Mister Van Statten owns the internet. <br>
ROSE: Don't be stupid. No one owns the internet. <br>
VAN STATTEN: And let's just keep the whole world thinking that way,
right kids? <br>
DOCTOR: So you're just about an expert in everything except the things
in your museum. Anything you don't understand, you lock up. <br>
VAN STATTEN: And you claim greater knowledge? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't need to make claims, I know how good I am. <br>
VAN STATTEN: And yet, I captured you. Right next to the Cage. What were
you doing down there? <br>
DOCTOR: You tell me. <br>
VAN STATTEN: The cage contains my one living specimen. <br>
DOCTOR: And what's that? <br>
VAN STATTEN: Like you don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: Show me. <br>
VAN STATTEN: You want to see it? <br>
ROSE: Blimey, you can smell the testosterone. <br>
VAN STATTEN: Goddard, inform the Cage we're heading down. You, English.
Look after the girl. Go and canoodle or spoon or whatever it is you
British do. And you, Doctor with no name, come and see my pet.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VAN STATTEN: We've tried everything. The creature
has shielded itself but there's definite signs of life inside. <br>
DOCTOR: Inside? Inside what? <br>
SIMMONS: Welcome back, sir. I've had to take the power down. The
Metaltron is resting. <br>
DOCTOR: Metaltron? <br>
VAN STATTEN: Thought of it myself. Good, isn't it? Although I'd much to
prefer to find out it's real name. <br>
SIMMONS: Here, you'd better put these on. (gauntlets) The last guy that
touched it burst into flames. <br>
DOCTOR: I won't touch it then. <br>
VAN STATTEN: Go ahead, Doctor. Impress me. <br>
(The Doctor steps through the heavy door.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: Don't open that door until we get a result. <br>
(Van Statten and Goddard go to a desk with monitors on it.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (It is dark inside. The door clangs shut and
locks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, I'm sorry about this. Mister Van Statten might think he's
clever, but never mind him. I've come to help. I'm the Doctor. <br>
(A white light blinks next to a blue glow.) <br>
METALTRON: Doc Tor? <br>
DOCTOR: Impossible. <br>
METALTRON: The Doctor? <br>
(The lights come up to reveal a bad tempered pepperpot being held in
chains.) <br>
DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! <br>
(The Doctor hammers on the door in terror.) <br>

destroyed! <br>
(Its gun arm twitches but nothing happens.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not working. <br>
(The Doctor laughs as the Dalek looks at its impotent weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Fantastic! Oh, fantastic! Powerless! Look at you. The great
space dustbin. How does it feel? <br>
DALEK: Keep back! <br>
(The Doctor stands inches away, staring into its eyepiece.) <br>
DOCTOR: What for? What're you going to do to me? If you can't kill,
then what are you good for, Dalek? What's the point of you? You're
nothing.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: What does that mean? <br>
DALEK: I am a soldier. I was bred to receive orders. <br>
DOCTOR: Well you're never going to get any. Not ever. <br>
DALEK: I demand orders! <br>
DOCTOR: They're never going to come! Your race is dead! You all burnt,
all of you. Ten million ships on fire. The entire Dalek race wiped out
in one second. <br>
DALEK: You lie! <br>
DOCTOR: I watched it happen. I made it happen. <br>
DALEK: You destroyed us? <br>
DOCTOR: I had no choice. <br>
DALEK: And what of the Time Lords? <br>
DOCTOR: Dead. They burnt with you. The end of the last great Time War.
Everyone lost. <br>
DALEK: And the coward survived. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, and I caught your little signal. Help me. Poor little
thing. But there's no one else coming 'cause there's no one else left. <br>
DALEK: I am alone in the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Yep. <br>
DALEK: So are you. We are the same. <br>
DOCTOR: We're not the same! I'm not (pause) No, wait. Maybe we are.
You're right. Yeah, okay. You've got a point. 'Cause I know what to do.
I know what should happen. I know what you deserve. Exterminate. <br>
(The Doctor pulls a lever on a nearby console and the Dalek is lit up
with electricity.) <br>
DALEK: Have pity! <br>
DOCTOR: Why should I? You never did. </font></p>

DOCTOR: You've got to destroy it! <br>
(The Doctor is dragged out.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: The last in the universe. And now I know your name. Dalek.
Speak to me, Dalek. I am Henry van Statten, now recognise me! Make it
talk again, Simmons. Whatever it takes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Adam's workshop]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADAM: Sorry about the mess. Mister Van Statten sort
of lets me do my own thing, so long as I deliver the goods. What do you
think that is? <br>
(Adam gives Rose an inch think piece of metal.) <br>
ROSE: Er, a lump of metal?&nbsp;<br>
ADAM: Yeah. Yeah, but I think, well, I'm almost certain, it's from the
hull of a spacecraft. The thing is, it's all true. Everything the
United Nations tries to keep quiet, spacecraft, aliens, visitors to
Earth. They really exist. <br>
ROSE: That's amazing. <br>
ADAM: I know it sounds incredible, but I honestly believe the whole
universe is just teeming with life. <br>
ROSE: I'm gobsmacked, yeah. And you do what, sit here and catalogue it?
<br>
ADAM: Best job in the world. <br>
ROSE: Imagine if you could get out there. Travel amongst the stars and
see it for real. <br>
ADAM: Yeah, I'd give anything. I don't think it's ever going to happen.
Not in our lifetimes. <br>
ROSE: Oh, you never know. What about all those people who say they've
been inside of spaceships and things and talked to aliens? <br>
ADAM: I think they're nutters. <br>
ROSE: Yeah, me too. So, how'd you end up here? <br>
ADAM: Van Statten has agents all over the world looking for geniuses to
recruit. <br>
ROSE: Oh, right. You're a genius. <br>
ADAM: Sorry, but yeah. I can't help it. I was born clever. When I was
eight, I logged onto the US Defence System. Nearly caused World War
Three. <br>
ROSE: What, and that's funny, is it? <br>
ADAM: Well, you should've been there just to see them running about.
Fantastic! <br>
ROSE: You sound like the Doctor. <br>
ADAM: Are you and him? <br>
ROSE: No, we're just friends. <br>
ADAM: Good. <br>
ROSE: Why is it good? <br>
ADAM: It just is. <br>
ROSE: So, wouldn't you rather be downstairs? I mean, you've got these
bits of metal and stuff, but Mister Van Statten's got a living creature
down there. <br>
ADAM: Yeah. Yeah, well, I did ask, but he keeps it to himself.
Although, if you're a genius, it doesn't take long to patch through on
the comm. system. <br>
ROSE: Let's have a look, then. <br>
ADAM: It doesn't do much, the alien. It's weird. It's kind of useless.
It's just like this great big pepper pot. <br>
(They watch the Dalek screaming as Simmons takes a big drill to its
casing.) <br>
ROSE: It's being tortured! Where's the Doctor? <br>
ADAM: I don't know. <br>
ROSE: Take me down there now. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lift]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: The metal's just battle armour. The real
Dalek creature's inside. <br>
VAN STATTEN: What does it look like? <br>
DOCTOR: A nightmare. It's a mutation. The Dalek race was genetically
engineered. Every single emotion was removed except hate. <br>
VAN STATTEN: Genetically engineered. By whom? <br>
DOCTOR: By a genius, Van Statten. By a man who was king of his own
little world. You'd like him. <br>
GODDARD: It's been on Earth for over fifty years. Sold at a private
auction, moving from one collection to another. Why would it be a
threat now? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I'm here. How did it get to Earth? Does anyone know? <br>
GODDARD: The records say it came from the sky like a meteorite. It fell
to Earth on the Ascension Islands. Burnt in its crater for three days
before anybody could get near it and all that time it was screaming. It
must have gone insane. <br>
DOCTOR: It must have fallen through time. The only survivor. <br>
GODDARD: You talked about a war? <br>
DOCTOR: The Time War. The final battle between my people and the Dalek
race. <br>
VAN STATTEN: But you survived, too. <br>
DOCTOR: Not by choice. <br>
VAN STATTEN: This means that the Dalek isn't the only alien on Earth.
Doctor, there's you. The only one of your kind in existence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Doctor's cage]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(So the Doctor is stripped and chained
spread-eagled.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: Now, smile! <br>
(A painful laser scan runs down the Doctor's body.) <br>
VAN STATTEN: Two hearts! Binary vascular system. Oh, I am so going to
patent this. <br>
DOCTOR: So that's your secret. You don't just collect this stuff, you
scavenge it. <br>
VAN STATTEN: This technology has been falling to Earth for centuries.
All it took was the right mind to use it properly. Oh, the advances
I've made from alien junk. You have no idea, Doctor. Broadband?
Roswell. Just last year my scientists cultivated bacteria from the
Russian crater, and do you know what we found? The cure for the common
cold. Kept it strictly within the laboratory of course. No need to get
people excited. Why sell one cure when I can sell a thousand
palliatives? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know what a Dalek is, Van Statten? A Dalek is honest. It
does what it was born to do for the survival of its species. That
creature in your dungeon is better than you. <br>
VAN STATTEN: In that case, I will be true to myself and continue. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me! That thing downstairs is going to kill every last
one of us! <br>
VAN STATTEN: Nothing can escape the Cage. <br>
(He blasts the Doctor with the laser again.) <br>
DOCTOR: But it's woken up. It knows I'm here. It's going to get out.
Van Statten, I swear, no one on this base is safe. No one on this
planet! <br>

scream.)

ROSE: No. <br>
DALEK: I am dying. <br>

becomes more animated.) <br>

plunger.) <br>

DOCTOR: This museum of yours. Have you got any alien weapons? <br>
GODDARD: Lots of them, but the trouble is the Dalek's between us and
them. <br>
VAN STATTEN: We've got to keep that thing alive. We could just seal the
entire vault, trap it down there. <br>
DOCTOR: Leaving everyone trapped with it. Rose is down there. I won't
let that happen. Have you got that? It's got to go through this area.

you want to negotiate then I can guarantee that Mister van Statten will
be willing to talk. I accept that we imprisoned you and maybe that was
wrong, but people have died, and that stops right now. The killing

VAN STATTEN: One million. <br>

different, and anything different is wrong. It's the ultimate in racial
cleansing and you, Van Statten, you've let it loose! The Dalek's
surrounded by a force field. The bullets are melting before they even
