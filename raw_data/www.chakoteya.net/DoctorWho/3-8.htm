<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The time machine has landed once more, and the
scanner shows the image of a rocky ravine.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can say that I know just exactly where we are. <br>
DODO: Past, present or future? <br>
DOCTOR: In the future. Very much in the future. We've now reached the
distant horizon of an age, an age of peace and prosperity. Now, I'm
going to be off. <br>
(They all move away from the scanner just as a primitive looking figure
wearing animal skins and carrying a club comes into view.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[outside the Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Leaving Steven and Dodo to wait by the Tardis, the
Doctor sets off along a narrow path through the scrub. He stops
occasionally to take readings, using a hand-held device that looks like
an old-fashioned ship's compass. He chuckles to himself.) <br>
STEVEN: He said five minutes. <br>
DODO: The Doctor has no idea of time. For someone who's travelled about
in time as much as he has, that's rather funny. <br>
STEVEN: This is nothing to laugh at, Dodo.<br>
DODO: Oh, don't take it so seriously. If you're so worried about him,
you shouldn't have let him go.<br>
STEVEN: All right. You try telling the Doctor what to do. <br>
DODO: Then you should have gone with him. <br>
STEVEN: You heard what he said. <br>
DODO: You don't have to do everything he tells you. You're a grown man.
Or are you?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Scrubland]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Along the ravine, the Doctor is absorbed in his
studies, unaware that he's being watched from the nearby bushes. To his
delight, the readings appear to confirm his initial conclusions.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's just as I thought. Yes. Yes, well I think my young
friends are in for quite a surprise. <br>
(The Doctor moves on. Concealed in the bushes, two men dressed in
animal skins watch him leave, then move to follow. Steven has left the
Tardis landing site.) <br>
STEVEN [OC]: Doctor! Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dear me, what was that now? Well, I shan't be long anyway. <br>
(Annoyed at the disturbance, the Doctor continues with his scans,
oblivious to the potential threat of the watching men. <br>
STEVEN [OC]: Doctor? <br>
(Sensing movement, the Doctor turns and peers into the bushes.) <br>
STEVEN [OC]: Doctor? Doctor!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dodo stands on a boulder and looks anxiously after
Steven. She's unable to see him over the bushes but hears his voice
clearly as he calls back to her.) <br>
STEVEN [OC]: He doesn't answer yet, Dodo. I think I'd better go and
look for him. <br>
DODO: All right. <br>
STEVEN [OC]: I won't go far. <br>
(Dodo sits down on the boulder to wait. From somewhere above her comes
the sound of pebbles trickling down into the ravine. Alarmed, she turns
and peers around nervously, hoping that her imagination is playing
tricks on her. After a moment, a primitive looking man appears on the
ridge above, crouched and apparently ready to attack. Dodo screams.
Steven comes running.) <br>
STEVEN: Dodo! What's happened? <br>
DODO: Up there. <br>
STEVEN: There's nothing there. <br>
DODO: I saw a man in animal skins and with an axe. <br>
STEVEN: You sure? Well, the Doctor said <br>
DODO: I don't care what he said. I saw him. He was like a savage from
the Stone Age. <br>
STEVEN: Then the Doctor was wrong. We're not in the future at all. We
must be back at the beginning of man. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Scrubland]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Having collected enough data, the Doctor starts
back towards the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: That ridiculous young man. He thought I'd made a mistake. <br>
(Behind the screen of bushes, the two primitives are fearful as the
Doctor approaches their hiding place.) <br>
TOR: He is coming. What's he carrying? <br>
CHAL: It is not a light gun. <br>
TOR: He is one of the leaders? <br>
CHAL: He is not one of our people. <br>
TOR: He is coming near. We must run. <br>
CHAL: Stay. We kill this man. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, there. I say, come out from underneath there. Now don't
be alarmed. Come along now. <br>
TOR: Look. <br>
(Behind the Doctor, the savages can see two soldiers approaching along
the path. <br>
DOCTOR: Can you hear me? Oh, I say, do come out from underneath there,
will you? <br>
(The Doctor spins round.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious me. You know, I thought for one moment you
were hiding behind those bushes. <br>
EDAL: We have come to welcome you. <br>
EXORSE: It is a great honour to have you visit our planet. <br>
(Captain Edal and his young companion are clad in synthetic military
uniforms and elaborate helmets. Each carries an energy weapon with a
wide, flared muzzle.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I see. Well, I am expected. Do you know who I am? <br>
EDAL: Not your name, of course, but our space observers have their own
name for you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, and what might that be? <br>
EXORSE: You are known to us as the Traveller from Beyond Time. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And how would you expect me here and now? <br>
EXORSE: The Elders of our city have been plotting the course of your
space-time ship for many light years. They estimated your arrival some
time ago. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Yes, well, that's very clever of them. <br>
EDAL: What is this? We understood from our Elders that you did not
carry weapons. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, they're quite right, yes, I never do. No, this is my
RV, you see. This is my Reacting Vibrator. I'm able to do my
calculations from this. As I told my young friends <br>
EDAL: You are not alone? <br>
DOCTOR: Good gracious, no. Did you expect me to be? <br>
EDAL: We have no information about your companions. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, they're very pleasant. Yes, they're both very pleasant
apart from their juvenile exuberances. I'm sure you'll like them. They
must be at the back here somewhere. I think they're rather worried
because I'm a bit late joining them. <br>
EDAL: We had no instructions about them. The Elders must be informed.
You must come with us. <br>
DOCTOR: Must? <br>
EXORSE: Captain Edal wishes to take you to the Elders of our City. They
are waiting to welcome you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, of course, yes, yes, yes, I shall come with you. In the
meantime, young man, I wonder if you'd mind trying to find my young
people for me. Steven and Dodo. Tell them the Doctor sent you. <br>
EDAL: Go for them, Exorse. Bring them to the city. This way.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STEVEN: I'll have to go and look for him, Dodo.
Something must have happened to him. <br>
DODO: I'll come with you. <br>
(Dodo looks up once more.) <br>
DODO: Steven! <br>
STEVEN: What is it? <br>
DODO: There is something up there. <br>
STEVEN: Look, you're imagining things. Come on. <br>
(Dodo screams as something falls heavily to the ground at their feet.) <br>
DODO: Told you. <br>
(Steven pulls the object from the soil.) <br>
STEVEN: A spear. It's sharp as a knife. You were right, Dodo. There is
someone up there. <br>
DODO: What are we do now? <br>
STEVEN: Back to the Tardis, quick. <br>
(Steven and Dodo turn and run back up the path. On the ridge above
them, several primitives emerge from hiding, chasing them along the
ravine throwing crude spears.) <br>
DODO: They're getting nearer! <br>
(Suddenly one of the savages is hit. Steven and Dodo take cover behind
the Tardis as an unexpected silence falls. Dodo peers round the Tardis
and screams.) <br>
EXORSE: Welcome to the Traveller's companions. You are Dodo and Steven?
<br>
STEVEN: How do you know? Who are you? <br>
EXORSE: The Traveller told me I would find you here. <br>
STEVEN: The Traveller? You mean the Doctor? Is he all right? <br>
EXORSE: Perfectly. He has gone to meet the Elders of our City. <br>
DODO: But the savages? <br>
EXORSE: I think you will find that some of us are fairly civilised. <br>
DODO: Then this isn't the Iron Age? <br>
EXORSE: By no means. <br>
STEVEN: The Doctor was right. <br>
EXORSE: Please, come with me to the City. Our Elders wait to honour
your Doctor. They will be very happy also to welcome his friends. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Council Chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is escorted to a vast walled city with
sweeping arches and elegant columns constructed of pale stone. A place
of light and learning bearing all the hallmarks of a highly advanced
society. An elegant bearded man greets the Doctor with a warm smile.) <br>
JANO: You are welcome, welcome indeed. Though we know you only as a
record in our charts of space and time, yet you seem to us like an old
friend. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's very kind of you to make me feel so welcome. <br>
JANO: We are honoured by your visit. The whole city looks upon you with
admiration. Let me introduce myself. I am Jano, leader of the council
of Elders. These are my councillors. We have all known about you for a
long time. Look, we have charted your voyages from galaxy to galaxy and
from age to age, but we never thought that we would meet you face to
face. This is a great moment in our history. To mark our admiration, we
would be pleased if you would accept the office of one of our high
Elders. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my dear sir, that's very good of you. Yes, yes, very good
of you indeed. Yes, I don't remember being so highly honoured before
like this anywhere I've been. <br>
(Two female attendants step forward to dress the Doctor in the
elaborate robes of a High Elder.) <br>
JANO: We recognise in you the greatest specialist in time-space
exploration. You have taken this branch of learning far beyond our
elementary calculations. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come, come, my dear sir. I know that you've been very
responsible for vast scientific research. And at the same time, I
always knew a race existed of great intelligence in this segment of the
universe. <br>
JANO: Thank you, Doctor. We like to think that we have created here
something of lasting value. <br>
DOCTOR: You have, you have. Indeed, you have. And if I may so say,
thank you dear ladies for making me appear so grand. <br>
(The Doctor is admiring his new clothes as Exorse arrives.) <br>
EXORSE: The Doctor's two friends, sir. Steven and Dodo. <br>
JANO: You are very welcome. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, there you are, both of you. Well, I don't think I was so
far wrong, my boy. What do I look like, my dear? <br>
DODO: You're really with it now, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. With what, my dear? <br>
STEVEN: What is this place? <br>
JANO: Did the Doctor not tell you? <br>
DODO: Not exactly. <br>
STEVEN: He said it was an age of peace and prosperity. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and I was right. They are very highly developed civilised
minds. <br>
JANO: But our calculations were incomplete. We did not realise that the
Doctor would have anyone with him. Nevertheless, although our honours
are for him, our gifts are for you. <br>
(Steven is presented with an ornate dagger and Dodo is given mirror
inlaid with precious gemstones. ) <br>
DODO: Oh, thank you. It's beautiful. <br>
STEVEN: Look at that, Doctor. <br>
DODO: Steven, these are real diamonds. <br>
JANO: Perhaps Steven and Dodo would like to make themselves at home. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, thank you. <br>
JANO: Our young people will show them round. <br>
DOCTOR: An excellent idea, sir. Well, my boy, now perhaps you'll
believe me next time I tell you I know precisely where I am. <br>
(Steven and Dodo are lead away as the Doctor turns back to Jano.) <br>
JANO: Now, Doctor, we have many questions to ask you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the City]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDAL: We're only the city guard, of course. They
don't ask our opinion, do they? <br>
EXORSE: What's the matter, Captain? <br>
EDAL: I don't trust them. I never did trust strangers. Why should we
treat this old Doctor as one of ourselves? <br>
EXORSE: The Elders think highly of him. <br>
EDAL: The Elders. All right, we've wasted enough time this morning. Get
back on patrol. Take the Crater section. <br>
(Edal and Exorse split up. At a distance the savages, now accompanied
by a girl, watch them go.) <br>
CHAL: They have begun hunting. <br>
TOR: We must warn our people. <br>
CHAL: Nanina, go back to the caves. Tell the families to hide. <br>
NANINA: But what of you, Chal? <br>
CHAL: We will be safe, we will warn the others. Nanina, take care in
the craters. <br>
(Nanina slips away. Out in the craters, Exorse is quartering the ground
in a standard search pattern. He's poised and alert, with his gun
raised, one finger curled in readiness on the trigger.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[City Avenue]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven and Dodo are being guided by a young man,
Avon, (no, not Paul Darrow) and a girl called Flower.) <br>
FLOWER: We have built into the city a life-giving sun of our own. Isn't
that right, Avon? <br>
AVON: It is man's intellect which decides the heat and cold in our
city. <br>
FLOWER: Yes. After all, the Elders do know what's best for us, although
it would be rather nice to know what real things are like sometimes. <br>
AVON: Real what? <br>
FLOWER: You know. Real wind, real rain, real sunshine. <br>
AVON: Don't be ridiculous. They have given us all this. <br>
DODO: It's beautiful. <br>
AVON: Our artists have every opportunity to develop their talents.
Here, everyone has a chance to do what is best for him to do. <br>
STEVEN: It's certainly a wonderful job. But how have you managed it?
What's the secret? <br>
FLOWER: Secret? What makes you think we have a secret? <br>
STEVEN: Other civilisations have failed to make this advance. <br>
FLOWER: Well, that doesn't mean <br>
AVON: Be quiet, Flower. Our scientists have made one simple discovery,
and due to this they have found the way to give us all greater energy,
greater intellect and greater talents. <br>
STEVEN: One simple discovery? <br>
DODO: What was it? <br>
AVON: This is something best discussed by the Elders and your Doctor.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Council Chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Well, gentlemen, I can't just sit here in
all these grand clothes without asking a few questions. After all,
there's my reputation to think about. <br>
JANO: What do you mean, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if I accept your gifts, I must endorse your life. But I
can't do that without knowing something about you. <br>
JANO: But surely you know a great deal about us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know very well that you are far advanced than most
planets. But how you achieve this, I know not. And let's face it
gentlemen, you are much advanced. Now, I would like to know how.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside The City]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Nanina is used to hiding from the guards with
their light guns, but that doesn't make her any less afraid, and she
makes slow progress, scrambling tentatively from one hiding place to
another. Poised close to the mouth of the ravine, she hears a movement
and spots Exorse patrolling the ridge above. Taking cover, Nanina waits
for him to move away. Chal and Tor look down into the ravine, Tor
straining to catch sight of Nanina.) <br>
TOR: I cannot see her. She must have got away. <br>
CHAL: She has not crossed the ravine yet. She is still hiding. <br>
TOR: Can you see the hunter? <br>
CHAL: He is going into the ravine. <br>
(Exorse makes his way along the floor of the ravine and disappears from
sight. Still concealed in the craters, Nanina is all too aware that she
must move on, and quickly, but there's scant cover between her current
position and the mouth of the ravine. Steeling her nerves, Nanina
forces herself to scramble forward with more haste than caution, her
fear making her careless. She slithers down into the basin of the
ravine in a shower of stones, alerting Exorse to her position.) <br>
CHAL: He is over there. And Nanina? <br>
TOR: She is there too. <br>
CHAL: Nanina! <br>
(Panicking, Nanina starts running along the ravine like a frightened
rabbit. Desperately scanning the rocks around her, she misses her
footing and goes sprawling on the ground. Frantically she claws her way
forward then scrambles to her feet again, running on in blind panic. As
Chal and Tor watch, Exorse appears on the ridge above Nanina. He takes
aim with his light gun.) <br>
CHAL: Nanina! Not that way! <br>
(Exorse fires his weapon. Nanina is engulfed in intense light, trapped
like a fly in amber. By moving the light gun, Exorse can control
Nanina's movements like a puppet. He directs her out of the craters and
back towards the city.) <br>
TOR: He has taken her.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Council Chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JANO: Life preys on other forms of life, as you
know, Doctor. Wild beasts live on other animals. Mankind must have
food, water, and oxygen. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, it's quite obvious to the meanest intellect that,
well, how can I say, that you've found a much more effective source of
energy. <br>
JANO: That is true, Doctor. We have learned how to transfer the energy
of life directly to ourselves. We can tap it at its source. It is as
though we were able to recharge ourselves with life's vital force.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the City]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Exorse and Nanina have left the ravine and pass
close by where Tor and Chal are hiding. Nanina is powerless under the
influence of the light gun, and does not react as Chal calls out.) <br>
CHAL: Nanina. Leave her. Leave the girl. Take me in her place! <br>
(But Exorse ignores the old man, and he and his captive continue on
their way.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Council Chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jano proudly shows the Doctor a complex model of
the technology that forms the heart of their society.) <br>
JANO: The energy of life which we accumulate we store in vats such as
these. Then, when the Elders decide that some member of the community
needs new force, we can transfer that energy directly. <br>
DOCTOR: To a member of your community. <br>
JANO: Exactly. We can give ourselves new power. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Of course, you need a very high form of life to make this
source effective. <br>
JANO: That is true, Doctor. We absorb only a very special form of
animal vitality. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[City Avenue]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Emerging from the scrubland, Exorse and Nanina
approach the city wall. Before them, a tall diamond shaped portal
starts to slide to one side as Exorse activates the opening mechanism.
Not too far away, Flower is proving to be an enthusiastic guide.) <br>
FLOWER: Don't think we're always serious. We play games, we dance, we
go hunting. Our life's very happy. We do everything we want, go
everywhere we want. <br>
AVON: Do not go that way. <br>
DODO: I thought you said we could go anywhere. <br>
AVON: Well, it leads to the world beyond the City. <br>
DODO: Don't you ever go outside? <br>
FLOWER: We're not allowed to. <br>
AVON: There is no need. <br>
FLOWER: Yes, that's right. Everything we want, we have here in the
City. <br>
STEVEN: What about the men we met outside? <br>
FLOWER: They're the guards. <br>
DODO: What, to keep back the savages? <br>
AVON: The savages? <br>
DODO: The men in animal skins. <br>
AVON: You saw them? <br>
DODO: They threw spears at us. <br>
AVON: Yes, well, the guards are to keep these people away. That is why
we seldom go beyond the City. <br>
FLOWER: Let's forget such a dismal topic. Come, I'll show you the
stadium. There's going to be a celebration there tonight especially for
you. <br>
(The tour continues but Dodo lags behind. Through a narrow window she
catches sight of Exorse and Nanina outside, as Exorse forces Nanina
through the door and into the City ahead of him.) <br>
AVON: Dodo! <br>
DODO: I'm coming. Every time I want to see something, they stop me. <br>
STEVEN: Dodo, you're a guest here. Try to behave like one. <br>
DODO: I hate conducted tours. <br>
STEVEN: What were you goggling at anyway? <br>
DODO: I saw one of the guards go past. He had a prisoner. <br>
STEVEN: You must be off your head! You wouldn't have a prisoner in a
place like this. <br>
DODO: He had one of the savages with him. A girl. She seemed to be
moving along in a light that shone from one of those guns they carry. <br>
STEVEN: Oh Dodo, really. <br>
DODO: Oh no, it's true. It was like a torch. As he moved, she went
ahead. <br>
FLOWER: Come along, we're just wondering which way to take you now. <br>
DODO: Why are they so cautious about what they show us? <br>
STEVEN: You imagine things. <br>
FLOWER: What are you whispering about? <br>
STEVEN: We're just coming. <br>
DODO: We're not going to find out much about this place from these two,
are we? <br>
STEVEN: Come on!

corridors deeper into the City. As they approach a door at the end of
the last corridor, the light beam wavers and moves off Nanina.
Disengaged, she reels and slumps against the wall.) <br>

entry.)

SENTA: That must be Exorse. He's already behind his deadline. What's
happening to security this morning? <br>
(Two technicians wheel a gurney across the centre, on which a male
savage is strapped. He appears extremely weak and disorientated.) <br>
SENTA: He seems very depleted. What's his vitality reading? Seventeen
point four. They took that very low. Can't they follow instructions in
there, or have I got to supervise every transfer of energy myself. Now,
let's see. His recuperative charge is high. He'll recover. Those
confounded guards, they're all the same. They keep you waiting, throw
the whole routine out of gear, and then they expect you to be ready for
them the moment they arrive. All right, take him away. Release him.
Help him along corridor KO4, emergency exit. Go ahead. <br>
(An assistant helps the exhausted figure to his feet and leads him from
the room. Senta opens another door to allow Exorse entry. Seeing
Nanina, Senta turns to instruct one of his technicians.) <br>
SENTA: Prepare this one. A47. We're behind schedule. We must transfer
immediately. I am filing a complaint, Exorse. You're late. Surely she
didn't give you much trouble? <br>
EXORSE: Of course not. I was delayed by the strangers. <br>
SENTA: You've seen them? <br>
EXORSE: Captain Edal and I were the first to find them. We brought them
back. That was why I was late. <br>
SENTA: You've actually seen them. What are they like? <br>
EXORSE: Very like us, in some ways. <br>
SENTA: But in some ways, they're different? <br>
EXORSE: Yes, but I can't quite say what it is. I must be going. <br>
(Exorse leaves.) <br>
SENTA: Is A47 ready yet? Yes, that seems all right. Tell them to be
quite sure not to take A47 below vitality reading 24. <br>
(At the chime, Senta activates a control to open the door, and the
assistant who removed the savage reappears.) <br>
SENTA: Is he all right? Let's see. <br>
(Senta activates an observation screen and appears satisfied to observe
the man moving slowly away.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven stares from a window onto a beautiful
communal square with a fountain. He's impressed by what he's seen but
still has questions.) <br>
STEVEN: This city really is fantastic. You've fountains, music,
everything. <br>
AVON: Yes, we're very proud of it. <br>
STEVEN: Why is it only within the confines of the City itself that you

and she moves cautiously towards it. She creeps along, heading slowly
for a T junction in the corridors from where the light shines dimly.
Slowly she becomes aware of ragged breathing and shuffling footsteps
coming closer. The strange acoustics in the corridors mean she cannot
pinpoint the direction of the noises. She edges ahead nervously,
eventually reaching the junction. Summoning all her courage, she steps
into the next corridor. Dodo finds herself confronted by a male savage
dressed in animal skins. His eyes are wide, staring blindly ahead as he
stumbles forward. Frozen in terror, Dodo is unable to move as he
lurches towards her, his arms outstretched. She screams.

clear she has nothing to fear. He's utterly drained and appears unaware
of her presence. He drags himself past her and towards the door at the
far end of the corridor. The door slides open, light flooding in. The
exhausted man collapses, and Dodo goes to help him. He tries to speak
but cannot. As Dodo helps him outside he stumbles, and Dodo is startled
as two more savages emerge from the bushes to help him up. Chal sees
Dodo and raises his spear to attack. The fallen man manages to stop him
as Dodo retreats into the corridor and the door slides closed once
more. Faint sounds of machinery and bubbling noises draw Dodo's
attention. She moves back along the corridor to investigate.)

JANO: They are hardly people, Doctor. They are not like us. <br>
DOCTOR: I fail to see the difference. <br>
JANO: Do you not realise that all progress is based on exploitation? <br>
DOCTOR: Exploitation indeed! This, sir, is protracted murder! <br>
JANO: We have achieved a very great deal merely by the sacrifice of a
few savages. <br>
DOCTOR: The sacrifice of even one soul is far too great! You must put
an end to this inhuman practice. <br>
JANO: You leave me no choice. Take him away, Captain. And tell Senta
that we have an emergency. I shall be sending him special instructions.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Exorse is making his way cautiously. Hearing
sounds, he picks up a heavy branch and swings it, just missing Nanina.)
<br>
EXORSE: Why did you follow? <br>
NANINA: If you betray Jano, what will become of us? <br>
EXORSE: It is Jano who is the traitor. <br>
NANINA: What have you learnt, Exorse? That we are people like
yourselves. What chance will we ever have if you speak. <br>
EXORSE: You think I can keep silent about what I've heard? <br>
NANINA: You owe me your life, Exorse. I have a right to ask you. If you
are against us now, you condemn us forever. <br>
(Exorse goes on his way, leaving Nanina alone.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SENTA: I promised Jano that I would tell no-one
about the in-transference, but now I must. It appears that Jano has
absorbed dangerous ideas from the Doctor. What can we do? <br>
EDAL: We can no longer trust Jano. He is not fit to lead us. I will
take command. Declare an emergency. We must be ready for Jano. <br>
(Exorse enters.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cave]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JANO: Everyone must do as I command. You too,
Doctor. No one will turn back. And now we must move.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDAL: You were a prisoner in the cave? <br>
EXORSE: That is correct. <br>
EDAL: Jano. I left him there alone. He had some plan. <br>
EXORSE: I did not see him. <br>
SENTA: According to Captain Edal, Jano is no longer to be trusted. He
has gone over to the savages.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[outside the City]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JANO: Come on, get a move on there. Come on, get
along. <br>
(The Doctor leads, with Dodo, Steven, Chal, Nanina and Tor following.
Behind them are several other savages and directing them all, forcing
them ahead with a light gun, is Jano. He uses the weapon like a whip,
herding his prisoners forward, shouting and cursing.) <br>
JANO: Come on.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Laboratory]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDAL: Are you sure, Exorse, you have nothing
further to report? <br>
EXORSE: Nothing, Captain. <br>
EDAL: Strange, very strange. We'll see what the interrogators can get
out of you. <br>
EXORSE: Only the leader has the right to send citizens to the interr <br>
SENTA: Captain Edal has called an emergency. He has taken over the
leadership in the absence of Jano. <br>
JANO: In the absence of Jano? <br>
SENTA: We did not expect you back here. <br>
JANO: Why not? Did I not say that I would be back with prisoners. Bring
in the strangers. <br>
(The line of prisoners is brought in under guard.) <br>
SENTA: So you were wrong, Edal. Captain Edal informed us that you had
gone over to the enemy, Jano. He has tried to take your place. <br>
JANO: Put the Captain under arrest. Both of you. <br>
EDAL: I demand to be heard. <br>
JANO: You will be heard at the right time and place. Take him away. <br>
(Edal is escorted from the room by two guards.) <br>
SENTA: We apologise, Jano. We thought that something had happened to
you during the in-transference. <br>
JANO: Seal off the doors. <br>
SENTA: Are we to prepare these savages for transference? <br>
JANO: Seal off the doors. <br>
SENTA: What's happening? I insist upon knowing. <br>
JANO: You will find what I going to say very difficult to understand.
All the Elders of our city are here, and so is the source of our
supremacy on this planet. No man easily gives up the means which give
him power. <br>
SENTA: I don't understand you, Jano. <br>
JANO: That is what I am asking you to do. I want you to destroy all
this. <br>
SENTA: What? The laboratory? The generators? <br>
JANO: All the machinery which we have used to destroy our fellows. <br>
SENTA: They are not our fellows, Jano. They are the savages. They are
not capable of development like us. <br>
JANO: How do you know? <br>
SENTA: All history proves it. The savages are good only to provide us
with energy. The laboratory must not be destroyed. <br>
JANO: These people whom you call savages are our equals. What we have
done to them is wrong. If you will not destroy all this, then I must. <br>
(Jano picks up a metal bar and smashes it down on the control panel
next to him.) <br>
SENTA: What are you doing? Stop him! <br>
(Senta dives for the alarm button.) <br>
JANO: This is our only chance to start life afresh on this planet. Help
me! <br>
SENTA: Well, don't just stand there! Use your gun. <br>
NANINA: Help, Exorse. It's the only way to help us all. <br>
(Exorse turns to smash the nearest console.) <br>
EDAL: Open the doors! We cannot get in. <br>
(Trapped outside, Edal and his guards try to break down the door. This
fuels the savages desire to destroy the laboratory. They turn on the
equipment with an enthusiasm to wreck it as thoroughly and quickly as
possible. Several of the Elders try to intervene, but they are no match
for them.) <br>
DOCTOR: You know, my dear, there's something very satisfying in
destroying something that's evil, don't you think? <br>
DODO: Yes! <br>
(Senta is powerless. The vats are smashed, the energy transfer process
ended forever.) <br>
JANO: This is only the beginning, Chal. After this destruction, our
people must learn to build a world that they can both live in. <br>
CHAL: And both sides must learn to trust each other. <br>
JANO: We may need a new leader. Somebody who can unite us. <br>
EDAL [OC]: Make sure the strangers don't escape. It is they who have
done this to us! Kill the Doctor on sight. These are my orders! <br>
(The door gives way and the guards swarm into the room.) <br>
EDAL: Get Jano! Arrest him. <br>
(The light beam misses its target and Steven stands to face Edal.) <br>
STEVEN: Stay where you are! What can you do now? The place is
destroyed. Your power's gone. <br>
EDAL: You! I should have killed you a long time ago. And you, Doctor.
You have done this to us. <br>
JANO: Edal, you have no more authority here. <br>
EDAL: You. You are a traitor. I do not take orders from traitors! <br>
STEVEN: Drop it! <br>
(Edal goes to fire but Steven is quicker. Edal falls unconscious,
caught in the blast of Steven's light gun.) <br>
JANO: Doctor, we already owe you much. (to Steven) And now I owe you my
life. <br>
DOCTOR: Jano, since you have destroyed the power you held over Chal and
his people, you realise now of course, you've got to learn to live
together. <br>
JANO: Yes, but the fear and hatred of the past will only die slowly. We
need someone like yourself as a mediator until we have become one
people. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. But in my case I'm afraid that is utterly impossible. <br>
JANO: The man we need must inspire trust. His judgements must come from
his heart, even more than his head. <br>
CHAL: Here is the leader we want, Jano. <br>
JANO: This is what I thought. <br>
STEVEN: Just a minute. I couldn't. <br>
DOCTOR: A great honour, dear boy. <br>
STEVEN: But I can't walk out on you and Dodo! <br>
DOCTOR: Just think of the challenge to be able to set up the people of
this planet for a new life. You're quite ready for this task. <br>
STEVEN: You think I can do it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. And you're the only man who can, my boy. <br>
STEVEN: Has the offer come from both sides? <br>
CHAL: You would give us new hope. Our people will become great again.
We will learn to live as equals without bitterness. <br>
STEVEN: What about Tor? <br>
TOR: I should accept your decisions. <br>
STEVEN: Very well. I will stay. <br>
CHAL: Thank you, thank you. (to the Doctor) And thank you. You have
justified our faith. <br>
(Dodo hugs Steven.) <br>
DODO: Oh, Steven. <br>
STEVEN: I shall miss you both, Dodo. <br>
DODO: I shall miss you. <br>
JANO: Doctor, for many light years we looked forward to your arrival on
this planet. We always knew of your wisdom, but we never dreamed of the
miracle that it would bring us. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jano. And if ever you need the benefit of my wisdom
again, I trust and hope you will allow me to express myself with my own
free will, rather than place me in an oven, and try and cook it out of
me. <br>
JANO: Come, Chal, we must summon our people. There is much work to be
done. We shall await you in our Council Chamber. <br>
(Jano and Chal lead the others away, leaving Steven alone with Dodo and
the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I must say, young man, I'm very proud of you. <br>
STEVEN: Doctor, I don't know if I <br>
DOCTOR: I know, I know, my boy. Well, go on, you mustn't keep them
waiting. <br>
STEVEN: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Steven, and good luck. <br>
(Steven leaves.) <br>
DODO: Doctor, do you think we'll ever see him again? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, who knows, my dear. In this strange complex of time and
space, anything can happen. Come along, little one. We must go. We
mustn't look back. <br>
(The Doctor and Dodo cross the scrubland to the Tardis, and it
dematerialises.)
