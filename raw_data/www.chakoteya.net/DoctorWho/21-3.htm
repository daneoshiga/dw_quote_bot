will discover to be Captain Revere hands over the piece of ore he has
dug out. Everyone say Hi to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0319566/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Peter Gilmore</a>, who
takes it away to a group wearing B7 Federation uniforms as Revere
watches the ground near his knees start to sink.) <br>
BRAZEN: The answer's buried here somewhere. The Captain will find it. <br>
(The sinking ground makes a pit prop move. Brazen rushes to hold it.) <br>
BRAZEN: Get out, everybody! Come on, move. Captain Revere! <br>
(The roof falls and buries Revere.) <br>
BRAZEN: Block and tackle! Quickly! <br>
(There is another roof fall. The body disappears.) <br>
BRAZEN: I want no mention of this to anyone. Do you hear me? Not to
anyone! </font></p>

from the interior. Then it goes very quiet.) <br>
TEGAN: The Doctor's all right. He gets like this sometimes. Nothing to
worry about. <br>
(The banging starts up again.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Well, I suppose it's none of my business. I think he must be
coming. <br>
(The Doctor bursts in.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not hat people, are you? Either of you? <br>
TEGAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Wear them much, I mean. I only do when I go out. It's silly to
have this thing getting in everyone's way. <br>
TEGAN: I don't believe it. <br>
(The Doctor takes the hat stand.) <br>
TEGAN: There's so much to do aboard this ship and all you're worried
about is tidying away the hat stand. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I have to start somewhere. <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor? Something's happening to the controls. <br>
(A monitor on the console says - Boundary Error. Time Parameters
Exceeded.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, we must be on the outer limits. The Tardis has drifted too
far into the future. We'll just slip into hover mode for a while. <br>
(Tegan looks at the monitor on the other side of the console.) <br>
TEGAN: We're in the Veruna system, wherever that is. <br>
DOCTOR: I had no idea we were so far out. Veruna. That's irony for you.
<br>
TEGAN: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: Veruna is where one of the last surviving groups of mankind
took shelter in the great er. Yes. Well, I suppose you've got all that
to look forward to, haven't you. <br>
TEGAN: In the great what, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: All civilisations have their ups and downs. <br>
TURLOUGH: (reads) Fleeing from the imminence of a catastrophic
collision with the sun, a group of refugees from the doomed planet
Earth <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's enough, Turlough. <br>
(Tegan has turned on the scanner to view the planet.) <br>
TEGAN: You mean some of the last humans are on this planet? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
TEGAN: Can we land? Can we visit them? <br>
DOCTOR: Laws of time. <br>
TEGAN: Since when has that ever stopped you? <br>
DOCTOR: Now, we mustn't interfere. Colony's too new, one generation at
the most. The future hangs in the balance. Now, I've got another one of
these somewhere. Put them side by side, we'll have a pair. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The troopers close a panel in the flooring. A
silver-haired man is not pleased.) <br>
RANGE: There is enough distrust already of the long path back to
knowledge. An enquiry into Captain Revere's death is vital. <br>
BRAZEN: I said, there's no requirement for an investigation. A
distillation vessel exploded here in the research room. <br>
RANGE: And that's your childish reason for closing down the whole of
the research room? <br>
BRAZEN: Captain Revere was quite specific. The research centre was to
be closed down in the event of his dying. I've nothing else to say on
the matter.<br>
(They go through into the research area proper, where a man is sitting
by a very large circuit board whilst wearing headphones.) <br>
RANGE: You're throwing away forty years work. Don't you care? <br>
BRAZEN: Simply obeying orders. <br>
RANGE: Look, we lost all our technology when our ship crashed here. Now
don't you think our struggle has been hard enough without this added
foolishness? <br>
BRAZEN: The only foolishness that I know is to disobey an order. Right,
enough of that, Cockerill. <br>
RANGE: What, you're abandoning the communications scan too? <br>
BRAZEN: Everything. <br>
COCKERILL: Forty years and nothing's come through on that set. I don't
think it's any great loss. <br>
BRAZEN: Nobody asked for your opinion on the matter. Get back to
corridor duties. <br>
(Cockerill salutes and leaves.) <br>
RANGE: On whose authority? <br>
BRAZEN: Plantagenet himself. <br>
RANGE: Oh, the boy's distraught. <br>
BRAZEN: Are you suggesting that the son of Captain Revere is unfit to
rule? <br>
RANGE: Look, as Chief Science Officer <br>
BRAZEN: Oh, don't go waving your title at me. From now on this research
centre is under military jurisdiction. <br>
RANGE: But the research into the bombardment. Now you must see the
urgency of that? </font></p>

BRAZEN: There'll be no more talk about this in front of our people,
Mister Range. The desertion rate is already unacceptable. Now, with or
without your permission, this research room will be sealed. </font></p>

we were <br>
DOCTOR: Impossible. Time's up. <br>
TEGAN: What happens to them, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Knowledge has its limits. Ours reaches this far and no further.
<br>
(The Tardis judders.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stabilisers are failing. Have to get out of here. <br>
TURLOUGH: It's a meteorite storm. <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis should be able to resist this sort of thing. The
console's jammed! <br>
TURLOUGH: We're being dragged towards the planet! <br>
TEGAN: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Gravitational pull? <br>
(By the crashed spaceship, workers scurry to shelter as alarms blare.) <br>
TEGAN: Doctor, do something. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't panic. <br>

ends. A young woman runs out to check on the ones who didn't make it
back inside. Range joins her.) <br>

DOCTOR: Come along. <br>

TEGAN: This way. <br>

get another person to their feet.) </font></p>

patient lying on the top of a basic metal bunk bed. The floor is very
uneven. One wall has a two tone portrait of a man's face on it. This is
the Beloved Leader, and the picture is all over the colony. It is also
the face of the man who died in the first scene.) <br>
TEGAN: In here. Over here. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. <br>
(Turlough and Tegan help their person into the other bunk bed. Range
sits his patient down on a step in the flooring.) <br>
RANGE: We shall need the emergency supplies. <br>
DOCTOR: Leave it to me. <br>
RANGE: Oh, thank you, sir. <br>
(The Doctor helps Range carry the patient forward to another section
where there is a padded examination couch.) <br>
DOCTOR: I shall need some antiseptic and bandages. <br>
RANGE: Antiseptic. <br>
DOCTOR: To clean this wound. <br>
(The Doctor takes off his jacket and hands it to Range.) <br>
RANGE: Look, I'm the Chief Science Officer. Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: It would help if we could see what we're doing. <br>
(Range snaps his fingers and beckons an orderly, who holds up a green
lamp.) <br>
DOCTOR: Phosphor lamps. <br>
(Turlough takes it from the orderly.) <br>
TURLOUGH: These are a terrible fire hazard in this sort of container,
you know. <br>
DOCTOR: Better hold it steady then, hadn't you. <br>
TEGAN: How does it work? <br>
TURLOUGH: Well, it's electron excitation. If you give them a shake,
they get a bit brighter.<br>
DOCTOR: Stop that, would you? Is this the best you can do? <br>
RANGE: Yes, I'm afraid it is. <br>
DOCTOR: We need some proper lighting. Turlough, the Tardis. I'll need
the portable mu-field activator. <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor, you did say <br>
DOCTOR: And five of the argon discharge globes. <br>
(Turlough hands the lamp to Tegan.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, and all medical supplies. <br>
TURLOUGH: Anything else? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you'd better give him a hand, Tegan. <br>
TEGAN: Right-o, Doctor. <br>
(Tegan gives the lamp to Range.) <br>
(The young girl brings a tray of instruments.) <br>
RANGE: This is my daughter, Norna. And you <br>
DOCTOR: Time for social niceties later. Better get started, hmm? <br>
NORNA: Yes, well, you'll want soap and water first. <br>

DOCTOR: I'm not helping, officially. And if anyone happens to ask
whether I made any material difference to the welfare of this planet,
you can tell them I came and went like a summer cloud. <br>
(Some people appear in the hatchway.) <br>
RANGE: They're curious to know who you are. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps you could ask them to move. They're rather blocking the
air. It's interesting. How often do you have meteorite showers? <br>
RANGE: Intermittently. Although the attacks have become more frequent
over the last few weeks. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. The attacks? <br>
RANGE: Oh yes. We're at war. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? With whom? <br>
RANGE: Well, that has yet to be determined. As you can see, we're
helpless. <br>
DOCTOR: Not if I have anything to do with it. How do you do? I'm the
Doctor. <br>
RANGE: Oh, hello. My name is Range. I'm the Chief <br>
(The Doctor spots something over Range's shoulder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. You've been keeping us unnecessarily in the dark, Mister
Range. You didn't tell me you had a hydrazine steam generator. <br>

BRAZEN: There's a development, sir, which I am not happy with. <br>
PLANTAGENET: Development? Yes? <br>
BRAZEN: An arrival, simultaneous to the last bombardment. Three persons
of undetermined origin. <br>
PLANTAGENET: So, it's come at last. <br>
BRAZEN: Yes. This could be the beginning of the invasion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: It's very interesting. <br>
RANGE: It used to generate a basic form of energy, but we no longer
have any fuel. This planet is without wood or any combustible material.
<br>
DOCTOR: What about the colony ship? Must have been brimming with
gadgetry. <br>
RANGE: Oh, systems that could rebuild a civilisation for us.
Failure-proof technology. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened to it all? <br>
RANGE: It failed. And nothing survived the crash. <br>
(Tegan runs in.) <br>
TEGAN: Doctor! Doctor, something's happened to the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
TEGAN: The interior door's jammed. <br>
TURLOUGH: As if some tremendous forcefield's pulled it out of shape. <br>
TEGAN: It couldn't be the impact of landing, could it? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis? No, no, no. Probably just some spatial anomaly.
You're getting carried away again, Turlough. One thing at a time.
Where's the mu-field activator? <br>
TURLOUGH: I'm trying to tell you. It's behind <br>
DOCTOR: It's behind the interior door. Yes, of course. Excitation. <br>
(The Doctor shakes the phosphor lamp.) <br>
TURLOUGH: You told me not to do that. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's risky, but then so is operating in this gloom. Have
you ever tried putting a higher voltage across one of these things? <br>
TEGAN: Doctor, the Tardis! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. There must be something on this planet capable of
sustaining a steady voltage. <br>
(Tegan and Turlough go to the now empty examination couch where Norna
is folding cloths.) <br>
TURLOUGH: How can you work, do research, without electricity? <br>
NORNA: Well, we used to use an acid jar charged by wind power. <br>
TEGAN: Acid jar? <br>
NORNA: A sort of large battery. <br>
TURLOUGH: That's a thought. With some sort of interrupter to raise the
voltage. <br>
NORNA: It's in the research room, but I'll need some help carrying it. <br>

TEGAN: There's a counter attraction. Look. <br>
NORNA: Food's rationed on Frontios. It's why the colony ship's guarded.
We'll have to be careful, the ship's out of bounds. <br>
TURLOUGH: It sounds dangerous. <br>
NORNA: Do you mind? <br>
TURLOUGH: No, it isn't that, it's just that I wouldn't want us to get <br>
NORNA: Quick, hide. <br>
(Turlough and Tegan hide behind boxes and barrels. Brazen and
Plantagenet come out of the colony ship.) <br>
BRAZEN: Stand straight, sir. They look to you. <br>
PLANTAGENET: Norna? You're needed in the hospital, surely. <br>
NORNA: I've come to ask for more bandages and water. <br>
BRAZEN: Do you think we have unlimited supplies? <br>
NORNA: You have supplies. What's the use of hoarding them? Leader
Plantagenet, the wounded need your help. <br>
(Plantagenet speaks to a trooper, who for some reason are referred to
as orderlies.) <br>
PLANTAGENET: Make sure this woman has access to the medical supplies
room. <br>
ORDERLY: Yes, sir. <br>
(Brazen and Plantagenet walk on with their escort. Norna goes to Tegan
and Turlough.) <br>
NORNA: Come on. <br>
(Tegan and Turlough wait until Norna enters the colony ship, then make
a noise. The trooper turns back to investigate and they slip inside
with Norna. Brazen goes over to the orderly.) <br>
BRAZEN: Orderly, are you responsible for this noise? <br>
ORDERLY: No, sir. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RANGE: Well, Captain Revere assumed that the
barrage was some sort of softening up process. Heralding an invasion,
he said. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, someone else thinks this is their territory. <br>
RANGE: Frontios was quite deserted when we arrived. <br>
DOCTOR: So you did nothing to provoke an attack. <br>
RANGE: No. The few that survived the crash had no time for anything but
bare survival. We worked to raise food. <br>
DOCTOR: Dangerous, surely, out in the fields with the risk of
bombardment. <br>
RANGE: Oh, there was no bombardment then. We had ten years of clear
skies to stock the wreck of the colony ship with food, and then it
began. Yes, the first missile a little over thirty years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: Thirty years? Your unknown invaders are certainly taking their
time. <br>
PLANTAGENET: Unknown no longer, perhaps. Could it be that one of them
calls himself the Doctor? </font></p>

DOCTOR: Going, yes, coming, no. We were forced down. <br>
PLANTAGENET: I see. You landed during the bombardment and yet you
appear unharmed. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, we didn't know there was a war on. At first we
thought it was some sort of meteorite storm. <br>
PLANTAGENET: And what do you think now? <br>
DOCTOR: I think your shelters are totally inadequate and your warning
system does nothing but create panic. <br>
PLANTAGENET: I did not ask <br>

required for guaranteed growth and you're regularly losing new lives. I

appurtenances of might, but we carry our strength within us. We will
win the war with the invisible aggressors whose missiles batter on our
planet, and we will win the greater battle, the struggle for the future
of our race. <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I wish you all the luck in the world.
Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to give you anything much in the way of
help. <br>
PLANTAGENET: We're under no illusions about that, Doctor. We can see
for ourselves the results of your help. <br>

going to arrange for some proper light by getting that thing <br>

great gift my father bestowed upon the people of Frontios. <br>

TURLOUGH: That's impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: For you and me, maybe, but when the Gravis really wants
something. <br>
TURLOUGH: The Tardis will be repaired? <br>
DOCTOR: With a bit of luck, any moment the plasmic outer walls of the
Tardis will seal. <br>
TURLOUGH: We'll be in our own dimension. <br>
DOCTOR: If your theory is correct, Turlough, the vital link between the
Gravis and his Tractator chums. Hold on! <br>
(The light gets brighter. The rocks are replaced by Tardis walls and
the Gravis collapses. The light returns to normal and the shaking
stops.) <br>
PLANTAGENET: Is he dead? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, but quite harmless, and as long as we keep him
isolated from the other Tractators, he'll stay that way. <br>
TEGAN: We can't go dragging around the universe with a dormant Gravis
on the console. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the first thing we'll do is drop him off on some
uninhabited planet.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Fully recovered and back in uniform, Plantagenet
and Range are walking.) <br>
PLANTAGENET: Brave man, this Doctor, travelling with the Gravis on
board. <br>
RANGE: Oh, it's quite harmless now. I inspected the creature myself. <br>
(Turlough has collected the hat stand.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Now all we need is a console room to go round it. <br>
RANGE: Well the Doctor and Tegan are due back any minute. <br>
TURLOUGH: He's got a present for you. <br>
PLANTAGENET: A present? But it is enough that he has given us our
freedom. <br>
RANGE: Yes, no more terror descending from the sky. <br>
TURLOUGH: Not unless you count the Tardis. <br>
(The Tardis materialises. The Doctor and Tegan come out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's that. The Gravis is safe and well on the
uninhabited planet of Kolkokron, exercising his animal magnetism on the
rocks and boulders. <br>
TEGAN: There's nothing but rocks and boulders out there. All the
planets are deserted according to the Tardis scanner. <br>
RANGE: Well, that's better than being among enemies, as we thought. <br>
PLANTAGENET: So, the last of mankind is after all quite alone. <br>
DOCTOR: Alone but in good hands, Plantagenet. Speaking of which, I know
it's not much, but, a farewell token. <br>
(The Doctor presents the hat stand to Plantagenet.) <br>
PLANTAGENET: Frontios is honoured, Doctor. But surely you'll stay a
while longer and enjoy some of the new colony we're building? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. Far too much repair work of my own to be done.
Besides, time and the time laws don't permit it. There's an etiquette
about these things which we've rather overlooked, I'm afraid. <br>
RANGE: But Doctor, you've done so much for us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. Don't mention it. <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis.) <br>
NORNA: After all he's done, he just says don't mention it? <br>
TEGAN: He means it, literally. <br>
TURLOUGH: Don't mention it to anyone. <br>
(Tegan and Turlough go into the Tardis and it dematerialises.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Now listen, you two. If the Time Lords
ever hear about our little trip to Frontios, there'll be serious
trouble. <br>
TURLOUGH: What would have happened if we hadn't been there, Doctor? <br>
TEGAN: Well, the Tardis engines would be working properly, for one
thing. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there's nothing wrong with them. <br>
(He hits the console.) <br>
TEGAN: Then why are they making that funny noise? <br>
TURLOUGH: We're going far too fast, Doctor. Stop the engines! <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, leave them. They're all right. <br>
(There is a whumph! sound and the Tardis judders. Everyone hangs on to
the console.) <br>
TURLOUGH: What's happening? <br>
TEGAN: The Gravis? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, this is something much more powerful. We're being pulled
towards the middle of the universe. I'm trying to pull against it. <br>
TEGAN: Against what? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I think we're about to find out. </font> </p>
