<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1746. Scottish Highland clans, loyal to Bonnie
Prince Charles Edward, battle with the English and German regiments
loyal to the English monarch, King George. Finally overpowered by
superior forces, the Highlanders break ranks and leave the battlefield.
The leader of Clan McLaren, Colin, is badly injured. His son Alexander,
daughter Kirsty and a young piper called Jamie McCrimmon, accompany
him. Confronted on the path by two Redcoats, Alexander engages the
soldiers in a sword fight. He kills one Redcoat and the other flees,
allowing the small group to move on seeking refuge. The Tardis
materialises in small hollow, concealed from view by bushes and
brambles. Ben comes out, followed by Polly and the Doctor.) <br>
POLLY: It's so cool. <br>
BEN: Hey, Polly. <br>
POLLY: What? <br>
BEN: Where does this remind you of? <br>
POLLY: Oh, it's cold and damp. <br>
BEN: No, where does it remind you of? <br>
POLLY: Ouch! Prickles! What? <br>
BEN: Where else could it be? We're home, Duchess! <br>
POLLY: Oh, you never give up hope, do you? We'll ask the Doctor. Hey,
Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. <br>
(There's an explosion in the distance.) <br>
BEN: It sounds like the cup final. <br>
(Something whistles towards them, fast.) <br>
POLLY: Look out! <br>
(Ben and Polly throw themselves to the ground as the something goes
Boom nearby. The Doctor hides in the brambles, hands over his head.) <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing down there? <br>
BEN: What was it? It looks like an old-time cannon ball. Ow! It's hot. <br>
DOCTOR: Allow me. Yes, a ten pounder. That does it. <br>
POLLY: But Doctor, we can't leave. This looks like England. <br>
BEN: Yeah, I'm going to look over that hill. <br>
POLLY: Doctor, you don't want us to think you're afraid, do you? <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
POLLY: Look, we can't let Ben go up there on his own. We don't know
what he's going to find. Come on. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In a ruined cottage, Kirsty is tending her
father's wounds.) <br>
COLIN: Ahh, Kirsty. Ahh. <br>
KIRSTY: He badly needs a doctor.<br>
(Everyone say Hi to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330240/" target="_blank"><font color="#000000">Hannah
Gordon</font></a>.) <br>
ALEXANDER: Aye, and food. <br>
COLIN: Water. Water. <br>
KIRSTY: Whist, father. <br>
ALEXANDER: Water. Water. <br>
JAMIE: There's a wee drop left yet. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to handsome young <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385668/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fraser Hines</a> as the
McLaren drinks from the canteen
and Jamie looks at the remaining piece of his bagpipes - the chanter.) <br>
COLIN: The battle. The battle! <br>
ALEXANDER: It's done. The clans are broken, shot to pieces by the
English guns. Never had the chance to get to within claymore's length
of them. <br>
COLIN: Ah, the slaughter. <br>
(Jamie starts to play.) <br>
ALEXANDER: Whist! Do you want to bring the redcoats upon us? <br>
JAMIE: They'll be here soon enough, have no fear. <br>
COLIN: The Prince? <br>
JAMIE: Dinna fash yourself. He was the first to leave the field. <br>
ALEXANDER: What's that you say about the Prince? <br>
COLIN: Ah stay, the pair of you. Why didn't you leave me to die on the
field? <br>
ALEXANDER: You're the Laird himself. <br>
COLIN: The Laird of what? All the men of our clan are lying in the mud
of the Culloden Moor. Oh, I should be with them. Oh, Kirsty, my Kirsty.
<br>
ALEXANDER: We may not be long joining them. The English troops are
butchering all their wounded and hanging all their prisoners. <br>
JAMIE: They canna hang us all, can they? <br>
ALEXANDER: They'll never hang me, piper. You may be sure of that. <br>
(Alexander sees movement outside) <br>
ALEXANDER: Whist! <br>
KIRSTY: The English? <br>
ALEXANDER: There is but three of them. <br>
JAMIE: They're not soldiers. <br>
COLIN: Our people? <br>
ALEXANDER: Well, I'll find out. Jamie, at the rear. You gang that way.
Wait my signal.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jamie and Alexander set off in opposite directions
to circle round. Ben spots an abandoned field gun.) <br>
BEN: Hey, look! This must be where that cannon ball came from. <br>
DOCTOR: It's unlikely. <br>
BEN: What do you mean it's unlikely? <br>
DOCTOR: It's been spiked. <br>
BEN: Been what? <br>
DOCTOR: It's been spiked. <br>
(A long spike has been hammered down the barrel.) <br>
BEN: Well, how did you know? <br>
(The Doctor has spotted a bonnet with eagle feather and Jacobite
cockade.) <br>
DOCTOR: I would like a hat like this. How do I look? <br>
POLLY: It's got words on it. With Charles our brave and merciful Prince
Royal, we'll greatly fall or nobly save our country. <br>
DOCTOR: Bah. Romantic piffle. <br>
(The Doctor throws the bonnet to the ground.) <br>
ALEXANDER: You'll pick it up. <br>
(His claymore is at the Doctor's throat.) <br>
JAMIE: Careful, like. <br>
(Jamie has his dirk at Ben's chest. The Doctor picks up the bonnet.) <br>
ALEXANDER: This way with you. Quick! <br>
(The battle draws closer.)

KIRSTY: Father, you're in no fit state to travel. <br>
ALEXANDER: Kirsty! Get away with you. <br>
COLIN: Who are they? <br>
ALEXANDER: I know not. They're no Scot. They threw down the Prince's
cockade. <br>
POLLY: Cockade? <br>
BEN: What Prince? <br>
DOCTOR: Prince Charles Edward. Bonnie Prince Charlie. <br>
ALEXANDER: You have the tongue. Aye, I thought so. English, the three
of them. Camp followers to the Duke of Cumberland, come to steal from
the dead. <br>
COLIN: Abide a moment! Do you wish to pray before you die? <br>
DOCTOR: Die? <br>
POLLY: Die for what? <br>
BEN: Well, you can't kill us in cold blood. <br>
JAMIE: Well, our bloods warm enough! Your English troopers gave no
quarter to men, women and bairns. <br>
POLLY: Doctor, tell them who we are. <br>
KIRSTY: Doctor? <br>
ALEXANDER: Get away with you, woman. <br>
KIRSTY: We have need of a doctor. <br>
ALEXANDER: The Laird. <br>
COLIN: Get me a doctor. Get me a doctor. <br>
KIRSTY: Look, kill them after. Let them help the Laird first. <br>
ALEXANDER: We're not going to trust the Laird with these sassenachs,
woman. <br>
(Ben dives forward and snatches a pistol from Colin's side.) <br>
KIRSTY: But if they can help him at all <br>
ALEXANDER: Kirsty, get away, will you. <br>
DOCTOR: Just think of the women. <br>
BEN: Right, back both of you! Or your Laird won't need a doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well done, Ben. And now, gentlemen. <br>
ALEXANDER: I'm warning you! <br>
DOCTOR: Your swords, I think. Ben, cock the pistol. <br>
KIRSTY: But why? Give them up! <br>
DOCTOR: Polly, take the swords. That's the style. Now, back against the
wall, both of you. Go on! That's better. Now, I'm going to have a look
at the wound. Come along, come along, let me see. Yes. We're going to
need some clean water to bathe the wound. Ah. <br>
(The Doctor picks up a bucket and gives it to Kirsty.) <br>
KIRSTY: I'll not leave him. <br>
DOCTOR: We're not going to harm him. Polly? <br>
POLLY: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: You go with her. <br>
POLLY: All right. <br>
DOCTOR: Off you go then. <br>
POLLY: Will you show me where the stream is? <br>
ALEXANDER: Here, Kirsty. Take the Laird's spyglass with you and watch
out for these Sassenach dragoons. <br>
(Polly and Kirsty leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: You can put that away now, Ben. <br>
BEN: Put it away? But <br>
DOCTOR: Will you both give us your word that you'll not molest us?
We're only trying to save your Laird from bleeding to death. <br>
ALEXANDER: Aye. <br>
JAMIE: You have our word. <br>
DOCTOR: Put it away, Ben. <br>
BEN: What, are you going to trust these blokes? <br>
DOCTOR: A Highlanders word is his bond. At least don't point it at me! <br>
(Ben tosses the pistol onto the table. Bang!) <br>
BEN: It just went off. <br>
ALEXANDER: You fool! <br>
JAMIE: You'll have every English soldier within miles! <br>
BEN: Well, what's wrong with that? <br>
DOCTOR: What's? You should have paid more attention to your history
books, Ben. <br>
BEN: Ay? <br>
JAMIE: Redcoats! There's about six of them. <br>
ALEXANDER: They'll slaughter us.

the cottage.) <br>
SERGEANT: Sir! A rebel's been sighted, sir, at the door the cottage
where the shooting seemed to come from. <br>
FFINCH: Good. Only one? <br>
SERGEANT: Only one seen, sire. There could be more. <br>
FFINCH: There better be. We haven't seen many, have we? <br>
SERGEANT: No, well, the troopers were ahead of us, sir. <br>
FFINCH: And done a good job. Now, I wish they'd left us some pickings. <br>
SERGEANT: Ah, perhaps when they got away they took their possessions
with them. <br>
FFINCH: Let's hope so. Take a man around the rear, Sergeant. We'll
out-flank them. <br>
SERGEANT: Sir! <br>
FFINCH: Tell them to shoot first and take no risks. Remember these
rebels will be desperate by now. <br>
SERGEANT: Yes, sir! <br>
FFINCH: Advance in battle order. <br>

It is but a very slim one. I will try and draw them away from this
cottage. <br>

here, have just arrived. <br>
SERGEANT: Deserter, then. You'll hang just the same. <br>
DOCTOR: (German accent) I'm glad you've come, Sergeant. I was waiting
for an escort. <br>

DOCTOR: A gentleman at last. Doctor von Wer, at your service. <br>

FFINCH: One of those confounded froggies that came over with the
Pretender. <br>
BEN: We ain't French. Are we? <br>

Let's hang them and have done. <br>
BEN: Well, a right shower you are! What have we done? Nothing! And what
have you got against these two? They lost a battle, right? Well,
doesn't that make them prisoners of war? <br>
FFINCH: Rebels are not treated as prisoners of war. Right, Sergeant,
prepare to hang them. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(On a supply wagon, an English solicitor called
Grey has been watching the battle through a telescope. His secretary,
Perkins, is setting up luncheon.) <br>
GREY: Perkins. Perkins! <br>
PERKINS: Yes, sir. <br>
GREY: Not a very inspiring battle, would you say, Perkins? <br>
PERKINS: Don't really know, sir. I've never seen one before. <br>
GREY: This one was over in a brief hour. Never have I seen such brave
fellows so poorly led. And now, Cumberland's troops are butchering the
wounded. It's such a waste of manpower. A little wine, Perkins? <br>
PERKINS: Oh, yes, sir. Quite ready for it, I am, sir. This sharp
northern air, sir, gives one quite an appetite. <br>
(Two soldiers appear with a Scottish prisoner. The wounded Highlander
looks longingly at the food as he is dragged past.) <br>
GREY: Ah, all these fine sturdy Highlanders. Used to hard work and
little food. Think what a price they'd fetch in Jamaica or Barbados,
Perkins. <br>
PERKINS: A pretty penny, no doubt, sir. No doubt at all. <br>
GREY: Indeed, and I'll have them, Perkins. I did not give up a thriving
legal practise, just for the honour of serving King George as his
Commissioner of Prisons. <br>
PERKINS: I thought there was more behind it, sir. <br>
GREY: With Mister Trask and his ship at our service, we may expect to
clear some measure of profit out of this rebellion, ay Perkins? <br>
PERKINS: Yes, sir. <br>
GREY: Depending, of course, on how many of the wretched rebels we can
deliver from his Majesty's over zealous soldiers. <br>
(Grey tastes his wine and spits it out in disgust, throwing the rest
into Perkins' face.) <br>
GREY: The wine was corked. If you wish to remain in my service, you'll
have to be more careful, won't you, Perkins? <br>
PERKINS: Yes, sir. My apologies, sir. It won't happen again, sir. <br>
GREY: I think we best be about our business, otherwise there'll be
nothing but corpses left on the battlefield. And corpses are of little
use to us, ay Perkins? <br>
PERKINS: Yes, sir. Wagon, sir? <br>
GREY: No, I think not. I've had enough for one day. Come, Perkins,
we'll walk. <br>
PERKINS: Yes, sir. <br>

GREY: Perkins. <br>

KIRSTY: Don't pretend you can't recognise English Redcoats when you see
them, even at this distance. <br>

an oak tree.) <br>

prisoners. <br>

All prisoners. <br>
SERGEANT: Not these. <br>
GREY: Perkins. <br>
(Perkins searches in his pocket.) <br>
GREY: The other pocket, I think. <br>
(Perkins produces some silver coins.) <br>
GREY: I admit your prior claim, Sergeant, but I think you are a
reasonable man. <br>
(The payment is refused.) <br>
GREY: Continue, Perkins. Continue, I said. Of course, I regret any
inconvenience encountered by yourself and these fine fellows of yours. <br>
SERGEANT: All right, you heard what the Commissioner said. Nooses off.
Get him down. <br>
BEN: Oh, thanks, sir. <br>
GREY: A trifle, I assure you. Strong ruffians like you and this other
young rebel here, are needed in his Majesty's service. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. <br>

GREY: You can despatch this one, Sergeant, and this strange looking
scoundrel. <br>
DOCTOR: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act, 1730. <br>
GREY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You are gentlemen of the law? <br>
PERKINS: How dare you speak to Mister Grey like that. <br>
GREY: I am a lawyer, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Then you are doubtless familiar with Article Seventeen. You
cannot hang a citizen of a foreign power, without first informing his
ambassador. <br>
PERKINS: Article Seventeen, Aliens Act? <br>
GREY: Who is this extraordinary rogue? <br>

DOCTOR: German. And I know more about the English law than you do, it
seems. <br>
SERGEANT: I'm the only law what matters to you right now, matey. And if
this gentleman don't want you, you hang. <br>
GREY: No, wait. You show a touching faith in his Majesty's justice,
sir. A doctor, eh? We need doctors where you're going. Send him along
with the other prisoners to Inverness. <br>

gaol, then we've got to get them out. Have you got any money? <br>

attested. It but wants your signature. <br>
GREY: Not before time. <br>
TRASK: A little wine for your cold heart, lawyer? <br>
GREY: I never mix liquor with business. I would advise you to do the
same. We sail on the morning tide, remember. <br>
TRASK: Happen it's too foggy to sail, what then? <br>
GREY: (sternly) You sail, fog or no fog. <br>
TRASK: And crash the old girl's timbers on Chanonry Point. <br>
GREY: I took you for a seaman. <br>
TRASK: Why, that I am. I am! Trask'll get your cargo of little booties
to Barbados, never fear. That's what really counts, lawyer. Not those
dried up bits of parchment of yours. <br>
GREY: Without these bits of parchment, we would all sail foul of the
King's law. <br>
TRASK: Law? What does the law or anyone care for those Highland cattle
we carry? <br>
GREY: Nothing. But to take these cattle safely to the slave
plantations, before their strength is sapped by his Majesty's prisons,
that takes skill and preparation. <br>
TRASK: And what would happen to you and me if this trade were to be
discovered to the Duke? <br>
GREY: That will never happen, Trask. There are but three of us privy to
this secret. I can answer for myself and Perkins. Ay, Perkins? <br>
PERKINS: Oh, yes sir. Yes sir, indeed you may. <br>
GREY: As for you, Captain, you must answer for yourself. <br>
TRASK: Twas but in jest. You know me, Solicitor. I'm your man. <br>

POLLY: But listen Ben, how did you manage to get loose? Underwater, I
mean? <br>
BEN: Well it's the old Houdini trick, duchess. You flex your muscles
when they tie you up, then when you're ready, you relax them. Well that

KIRSTY: No. <br>
POLLY: And that's all there is to it? <br>
BEN: Well, almost all. <br>
POLLY: I bet. <br>
POLLY: Hey you've got your own clothes back. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Can you imagine, I found them thrown out on the rubbish
dump, behind the inn. <br>
BEN: Amazing, isn't it? Well mine should be dry by now. <br>
POLLY: I liked you better in your dress, Doctor. <br>
KIRSTY: Aye, you made a good granny. <br>
DOCTOR: Now then, do we all know what we have to do? Ben? <br>
BEN: Yeah, I take you out to the ship in the rowing boat. Then double
round the back smartish while they're sorting you out, and then pass
the weapons through the porthole. <br>
POLLY: While Kirsty and I just sit here and wait for you to get back,
if you ever do. No fear. <br>
KIRSTY: We've done enough waiting. <br>
DOCTOR: But it may be dangerous. They may not swallow my story. <br>
BEN: Yeah, and they may see me in the boat, even with this on. <br>
(Ben pulls a tam-o'-shanter over his face.) <br>
DOCTOR: I would like a hat like that. <br>
POLLY: Nevertheless, we're not going to let you two out of our sights,
are we, Kirsty? Well, you get into such terrible trouble without us. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well, you shall come in the rowing boat. It might be a
good idea at that. <br>

JAMIE: And what will they do with us, sir? <br>
COLIN: I fear they will make an example of us, once Trask gets away to

DOCTOR: From the hands of Prince Charles himself. <br>
GREY: Where, man, where? <br>
DOCTOR: In prison. <br>
GREY: I don't follow. <br>

Highlander and was taken prisoner with the rest of the rebels. <br>
GREY: And where is he now? <br>
