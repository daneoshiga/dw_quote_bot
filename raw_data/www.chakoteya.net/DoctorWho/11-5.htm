COMEDIAN [OC]: Here's a funny thing. Here's a funny thing. When
Archimedes, you've heard of Archimedes, jumped out of his bath and ran
down the road without his clothes on, he didn't shout Eureka, he
shouted I'm a streaker! <br>

Tidmarsh Manor - in the middle of nowhere and gone inside. He wanders
along a corridor and opens a door. Somewhere downstairs, people are
chanting to cymbal accompaniment. He goes down the staircase and
listens.) <br>

henceforth referred to as the chant. Mike peers around the out cellar
door then quietly goes in as the chanting becomes more forceful,
building up to something. A turquoise glow appears in the middle of the
mandala. Moving forward, Mike walks into a spider's web. He recoils and
knocks a candlestick, then back up the stairs. The sound of his
footsteps breaks the chant.

DOCTOR: Ah, Professor Clegg. How good of you to come. <br>
CLEGG: To be honest, I'm not quite sure why I have come. Your message
was somewhat ambiguous. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, It's my fault entirely. I do apologise. Won't you sit
down? <br>
CLEGG: Thank you. You, er, you want me to do my act for you? Some sort
of regimental guest night, is it? Cabaret? I do a lot of dinners. <br>
BRIGADIER: Lord, no. But clever stuff, mind you, but not really my cup
of tea. <br>
CLEGG: Oh, then, er, what exactly is it you want of me, gentlemen? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you see, Professor, I'm doing a little research into ESP.
<br>
BRIGADIER: That's extra sensory perception, you know. <br>
CLEGG: Ah, yes, as a matter of actual fact, I did know that. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, really? Well, I can't say that I did until the Doctor
explained this morning. <br>
DOCTOR: You see, Professor, my particular field covers, er,
psycholotry, telepathy and clairvoyance as well, so I thought perhaps
you might be able to help me. <br>
CLEGG: Oh. Well, you see, I'm afraid I can't, dearly as I'd like to. <br>
DOCTOR: You disappoint me, Professor. <br>
CLEGG: Well, there you are, that's just it. I'm, er. Well, I'm not a
professor at all. That's just for, er, well, you know, professional
purposes, do you see? <br>
BRIGADIER: You're trying to tell us that it was all a lot of tricks. <br>
CLEGG: Well, er, not to put too fine a point on it, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a word code with your assistant, eh? <br>
CLEGG: Ah. Very perspicacious of you, Doctor. I feel sure that my
secret is safe with you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, indeed it is, Professor. Indeed it is. <br>
CLEGG: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: I assure you that I shall tell nobody that you are really a
very powerful clairvoyant. <br>
CLEGG: I beg your pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: That's your real secret, isn't it? <br>
CLEGG: Why ever should you think that? <br>
DOCTOR: You made a couple of mistakes last night, Professor. You gave
the answer before your assistant had uttered a word. <br>
CLEGG: Oh. It's happening more and more. I don't want it to! I was
quite happy as a performer, Doctor, but I seem to be developing this,
this power! Oh, I hate it. I hate it. The things I can make happen. <br>
DOCTOR: Physical manifestations? Psychokinesis, for example? <br>
CLEGG: Well, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: That's remarkable. <br>
BRIGADIER: Would you mind explaining? <br>
CLEGG: Psychokinesis? Moving things by the power of the mind. <br>
DOCTOR: A very rarely developed faculty in homo sapiens. Professor?
Mister Clegg. Would you give us a demonstration? <br>
CLEGG: Well, er. <br>
DOCTOR: Please? <br>
CLEGG: Oh, very well. <br>
(Clegg concentrates on a tray over on a desk, with a plate and plastic
cup on it. Gently, it rises into the air and moves towards him.) <br>
CLEGG: I can't, I can't keep it up. <br>
(The tray clatters to the floor at the Brigadier's feet.) <br>
BRIGADIER: You ought to use that in your act. <br>
CLEGG: And lose my sanity? It would be a poor exchange. <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Clegg, your powers may seem to be extraordinary, but I
assure you that they lie dormant in everyone. They're perfectly
natural. <br>
CLEGG: I find that very difficult to believe. <br>
DOCTOR: But that's what my experiment's are all about, Mister Clegg. <br>
CLEGG: You mean, you mean you can find out why I'm different? <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly. <br>
CLEGG: Then I. Very well, I'll help you all I can. <br>
DOCTOR: Good.

LUPTON: Why not? You used to, in Tibet. <br>
CHO-JE: All things pass away, as you will learn in your meditation.

BARNES: Go and get on with your work, Tommy. You're not wanted here. <br>
TOMMY: Finished weeding. Look, Barnes. Pretty flower. <br>
BARNES: Yes, I can see. Now go and find something else to do, will you?
<br>
TOMMY: Going to have a cuppa. Er, you like a cuppa? Er, you like a

MIKE: Yes, isn't it. <br>
SARAH: Oh, come on, Mike. Out with it. <br>
MIKE: Hmm? <br>
SARAH: What is it all about? <br>
MIKE: I told you. It's a great story for that magazine of yours. <br>
SARAH: A couple of refugee Tibetan monks setting up a lamasery in
darkest mummerset? <br>
MIKE: It's not a lamasery. It's a meditation centre. <br>
SARAH: Okay, so maybe meditation's the in-thing. Maybe I can sell it to
Percy. I still want to know what it's all about. Look, you'd better
start at the beginning. I mean, what are you doing here anyway? <br>
MIKE: Trying to sort myself out, I suppose, after that golden age mess.
<br>
SARAH: Ah. <br>
MIKE: I mean, like you said, everybody's going on about meditation of
one sort or another, so I thought I'd have a crack at it. Then I saw in
the paper about these two Tibetans. <br>
(The group are back around the mandala doing the Om Mani padme hum
chant again.) <br>
SARAH: Well, it sounds to me as if these people are just getting on
with their meditation. You know, doing a bit of homework. <br>
MIKE: Then why be so secret about it? No, they're up to something. I
think they're in touch with some. Oh, I don't know, some power. It's
definitely a job for UNIT. <br>
SARAH: Well, then, you must tell the Brig or the Doctor. <br>
MIKE: And you think they'd believe me? Last time we met I pulled a gun
on them. <br>
SARAH: Oh, now I get it! <br>
(The chanting builds up to a peak, and we zoom in on Lupton.) <br>
SARAH: So, you want me to have a look round and then tell the Brig for
you? <br>
MIKE: That's the general idea. <br>
SARAH: Hmm. <br>
MIKE: Please? <br>
SARAH: Okay. <br>
MIKE: Bless you, Sarah Jane. <br>
SARAH: You'll have to convince me though. <br>
MIKE: Don't you worry. <br>

up her arms to shield her face. They swerve off the road, which is now
completely empty.) <br>

headphones that Clegg is wearing to a monitor.) <br>
DOCTOR: You see, Brigadier, the electrocephalograph will show us his
brainwaves on here as we carry out the tests. Right, let's try a little
simple psycholotry, shall we? Er, Lethbridge Stewart, my dear fellow,
would you like to give Mister Clegg some little article of yours? <br>
BRIGADIER: What? Oh. Yes, yes, rather. <br>
(The Brigadier takes off his wrist watch.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Here. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Ready when you are, Mister Clegg. <br>
CLEGG: This watch was given to you eleven years ago. You received it in
a hotel. A hotel by the sea. Brighton, was it? From a young lady called
Doris. She said it was to mark her gratitude to you <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, all true, absolutely spot on. <br>

DOCTOR: A little too much perhaps, eh, Alastair? <br>

Reproduction Integrating System. It translates your thoughts into
pictures on this monitor here. Try this, will you? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sarah is taking down shorthand as Mike sits in on
the interview.) <br>
CHO-JE: We can but point a finger along the way. A man must go inside
and face his fears and hopes, his hates and his loves, and watch them
wither away. Then he will find his true self, which is no self. He will
see his true mind, which is no mind. <br>
SARAH: And that's what meditation's all about? <br>
CHO-JE: Yes! The old man must die and the new man will discover to his
inexpressible joy that he has never existed. <br>
SARAH: Well, good luck, mate. <br>
MIKE: I think I'm going to need it. <br>
SARAH: But if you do start ferreting about in your subconscious, aren't
you going to turn up all sorts of nasties? I mean, complexes, phobias
and what have you? <br>
CHO-JE: Of course, the demons and the divinities. But in our way, the
Vajrayana Way, we use the powers to help us. If we will excuse me, it's
time for the meditation class. <br>
MIKE: But couldn't that be dangerous? If these, these powers were used
wrongly. <br>
CHO-JE: It could be so, yes. By evil men in their ignorance and
craving, it could indeed be most dangerous. <br>
MIKE: I see. <br>

you. <br>

LUPTON: We've done it.&nbsp;<br>
SPIDER [OC]: Yes, we've done it. Together. <br>
LUPTON: Will this give us power? <br>
SPIDER [OC]: More power than you dared to dream of. Veil your mind! You
must cloak your ambition. I can understand it, perhaps I share it, but
if my sisters on Metebelis Three were to have an inkling of your
thoughts, they would kill you. Beware! They seek to make the link.

LUPTON: What about me? I am to be forgotten? <br>
QUEEN: You are not necessary! <br>
LUPTON: Oh, but I am. Without me, you would never have recovered your
precious crystal. I've been your friend. <br>
QUEEN: A friend? A two leg dares to claim friendship with the eight
legs, the noble ones? <br>
SPIDER [OC]: He means no harm, O Queen, and it is true that he has
served us well. <br>
QUEEN: Very well. His reward will be to serve us further. We could use
him in the great work, the conquest of Earth. <br>
SPIDER [OC]: Conquest? <br>
QUEEN: This is the secret purpose of the Great One. <br>

QUEEN: That is why she requires the crystal. We shall return to our

to return. Be ready.

BARNES: Yes, yes. <br>

taking over the country, the entire stinking world. I want to see them

they just take it before you did? <br>

together some of the men from the other villages. They're going to try

DOCTOR: Yes, well, I have a strange feeling that you already know most
of it. You see, I found a crystal. A blue crystal. <br>
K'ANPO: Found? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps stole might be a better word. Forgive me. Have we
met before? <br>
K'ANPO: The recognition of friends is not always easy. Tell me about
this crystal you stole. <br>
DOCTOR: Well it didn't occur to me that I had stolen it, at the time.
