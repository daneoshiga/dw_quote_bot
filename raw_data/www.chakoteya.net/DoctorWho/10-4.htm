<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The story carries straight on from <a href="10-3.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
Frontier in
Space</a>. The Doctor has been accidentally shot by the Master,
as the Ogrons jolted his arm whilst fleeing from a generated image of
the thing they feared most. Now the place is deserted, and the Doctor
wakes. He is very weak.) <br>
JO: Oh, Doctor, I thought you were dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Help me up. <br>
JO: Come on. That's it, yes. Careful. <br>
DOCTOR: Help me into the Tardis, Jo. <br>
JO: Okay.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: All right, Jo. <br>
JO: Careful. <br>
DOCTOR: The first thing we've got to do is get out of here. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises. The Doctor places his hands on two round
disc on the console and concentrates.) <br>
JO: Doctor, what are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Telepathic circuits. Sending a message to the Time Lords. I
must tell them to. I must, I <br>
(The Doctor collapses.) <br>
JO: Doctor! <br>
(Jo runs over to a wall covered in what appear to be fitted drawers and
cupboards. She presses one and a bed slides out.) <br>
JO: Come on, come and sit down. Come on. That's it. <br>
DOCTOR: Help me off with this. <br>
JO: Let me get this. Now just lie back. <br>
DOCTOR: Must lie down, Jo. <br>
JO: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Must rest for a while. Must rest. I must rest, Jo. <br>
JO: Yes. <br>
(Jo dabs at the blood on his forehead.) <br>
JO: It's all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Jo, now listen to me. I'm liable to sleep for quite some
time. Now, if anything happens, anything at all, record it in the log.
Record it in the log. <br>
JO: Log? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
JO: What log? Doctor, I don't know what you're talking about! <br>
DOCTOR: In the log, up there in the locker. <br>
(Jo takes what looks like a large cassette tape from a cupboard above
the bed.) <br>
JO: Doctor? <br>
(The Doctor is unconscious. Later, Jo has got changed and freshened up,
and returns to the console room to find him delirious.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jo! Jo, careful! <br>
JO: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Jo! JO: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Jo! <br>
JO: Doctor! <br>
(The Doctor goes quite still, so Jo checks his hearts.) <br>
JO: Oh, he's so cold. <br>
(Jo makes her first log entry.) <br>
JO: Shortly after entering the Tardis, the Doctor fell into a deep
coma. His respiration was very shallow and his skin icy to the touch. I
could find no trace of pulse or heartbeat, and his breathing apparently
ceased. But I've seen the Doctor in this condition once before and he
recovered after a sudden rise in temperature. <br>
(Something beeps on the Tardis console and it starts to materialise.) <br>
JO: The Tardis seems to have landed. I suppose the Time Lords are
working it by remote control again. I've no idea what the Doctor said
to them in his message, or where we are. I just hope that they've
brought us somewhere where I can find some help for the Doctor. <br>
(Crystals are forming on the Doctor's skin.) <br>
JO: Ice! <br>
(The Doctor's eyes open.) <br>
JO: Doctor! Doctor, you're alive! Doctor? Doctor, I don't know whether
you can hear me or not. Both your hearts are beating about oh, about
once every ten seconds and your body temperature is somewhere below
zero. I'm going outside. I'm going to try and find some help. <br>
(Jo goes to the console.) <br>
JO: Scanner, scanner. Scanner. That's it. <br>
(The scanner shows a lush jungle outside with some stone ruins. Then
something squirts liquid onto the scanner obscuring the view.) <br>
JO: Doctor? Doctor, I'm going now. I'll be back as soon as I can.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Jungle]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Jo goes outside, and she gets squirted with the
liquid which is coming from some of the local flowers. The lower half
of the Tardis has a brown encrustation over it. Jo looks at the
standing stones then heads off through the thick vegetation, nervous at
the sound of animals that fill the jungle. She is carrying the log
recorder, and settles down at the base of a tree to rest. Suddenly the
sky becomes very bright.) <br>
JO: Things growing in this jungle seem more like animal than plant
life. The light is changing. It seems as if it's daybreak. There's a
sudden change in temperature. I haven't seen any form of intelligent
life except, except those bits of statue by the Tardis. <br>
(Now it is warmer, Jo takes off her raincoat. The back is covered with
the encrustation from the plant liquid. She throws it away and moves
off. The pitcher plants watch her go, and something we cannot see puffs
and pants its way through the bamboo after her.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Jo? Jo, where are you? <br>
(The Doctor appears completely healed. We can still hear the arum
plants squirting liquid at the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jo? Jo? <br>
(Jo finds some footprints in the soil. She takes off her mittens as she
bends down to examine them, and gets squirted. She moves on. The Doctor
checks the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's odd. The atmosphere outside is breathable and yet the
automatic oxygen supply is on.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Jungle - landing site]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Jo has put her mittens on again and followed the
footprints to a spacecraft. She goes up to a hatch between its two
engine exhausts.) <br>
JO: Hello? Hello, is anybody there? <br>
(She walks along the side of the ship but there are no other visible
doorways so she returns to the rear and opens the hatch. The inside is
small but tidy with dials on the wall. Up front is a figure in a
spacesuit, with cobwebs. She touches it and it tumbles sideways.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis door does not open. It sounds as if it
is blocked by something. Then an alarm sounds and the monitor shows the
message 'Automatic Oxygen Supply Exhausted') <br>
DOCTOR: I'll just have to use the emergency supply. <br>
(The Doctor opens a small wheeled box and opens the valve of the first
cylinder. It hisses briefly and stops. He tries the second but that
runs out too. The third and final one seems to work properly so he goes
to get changed. Then the oxygen runs out of that one too.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Spaceship]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Jo tries to hide as someone approaches the ship.
It is a blond man in a spacesuit with a weapon. He easily finds Jo and
brings her into the main compartment. There is a younger man with him.)
<br>
JO: Who are you? <br>
TARON: My name is Taron. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0395420/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Bernard
Horsfall</a> - again) <br>
TARON: This is Vaber. <br>
JO: I'm Jo Grant. Do you live here? I mean do you live on this planet? <br>
TARON: What are you? Where are you from? <br>
JO: Well, I'm from a planet called Earth. <br>
VABER: Earth? <br>
(Say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0359417/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
Prentice Hancock</a><a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">,
before Space 1999</a>.)&nbsp;<br>
JO: You've heard of it?&nbsp;<br>
TARON: We've heard of the name. <br>
VABER: There is no such place as Earth. It's just a name in our old
legends. It doesn't really exist. <br>
JO: Believe me, it does! <br>
TARON: How did you come here? <br>
JO: In the Tardis. <br>
TARON: Tardis? <br>
JO: Well, yes, it's a sort of spaceship. <br>
VABER: Are you alone? <br>
JO: No. No, I have a friend with me and he's very sick. I was trying to
find some help for him. Look, I'm afraid he's dying. <br>
VABER: We're not a hospital service. <br>
JO: Oh please? Please, you've got to help me. <br>
TARON: I'm qualified in space medicine. I'll do what I can. <br>
JO: Thank you. I was beginning to think that I'd never find anybody to
help me. <br>
VABER: You were lucky they didn't find you. <br>
JO: They? <br>
TARON: Where is this ship of yours, the Tardis? <br>
JO: Well, back through the jungle. <br>
TARON: Is it far? <br>
JO: Well, no, not far. It's by some bits of statue. <br>
VABER: Reference seven? <br>
TARON: Yes, yes, yes. <br>
JO: Look, come on, I'll take you there, right? <br>
(Another blond man in a spacesuit enters.) <br>
CODAL: Very near, a patrol. <br>
VABER: How many? <br>
CODAL: Three or four, headed this way. Who's this? <br>
TARON: We have to move. <br>
JO: Well, I'm coming with you. <br>
TARON: No, we know this jungle now. We can move in it quietly and
quickly. You'll be safer if you stay hidden here. <br>
(Taron opens a small compartment.) <br>
TARON: Get inside. You can work the securer from in there. <br>
JO: But I want to come with you. <br>
TARON: That would slow us all up. You'd endanger all of us. Don't
worry. We'll lead them away from here, lose them in the jungle. <br>
JO: Lose who? <br>
VABER: Come on! Come on! <br>
TARON: We'll do what we can for your friend. I'll come back for you
later. <br>
JO: Thank you. Please hurry! <br>
(The three men move off, weapons ready. Jo shuts herself in the small
compartment and watches through the door grill. The spaceship rocks,
there is the sound of breathing, and a small object rises up, twists
around then goes back to where it was. Then a door opens and items are
thrown out onto the floor.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Jungle]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VABER: Which way are they moving? <br>
TARON: We're all right. They seem to be staying on the main tracks.
There's a few scouts moving independently, but off that way. <br>
CODAL: What about the girl? <br>
TARON: Oh, she should be all right. <br>
VABER: And this friend of hers? <br>
TARON: Let's go and find him. <br>
(In the spaceship, something tries the handle to Jo's compartment but
cannot get in. What might be a fire extinguisher is picked up, examined
and put down, then the outer hatch opens and closes and triangular
prints appear in the soft soil. Jo comes out of hiding and leaves the
spaceship.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The scanner now says 'Cabin Atmosphere Unable to
Sustain Life'. The Doctor is working under the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: All the circuits are in order. The door must be held from the
outside. I must get it open. I must get that door open. Got to get the
door, got to get that door open. <br>
(He staggers to the doors and tries to push.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's it. Must get it open. (falls to the floor) Must get it
open. Must get, must get, must get.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Outside the Tardis, Vaber and Taron are hacking
at the encrustation on the doors while Codal stands guard. The two men
are wearing plastic protection from the liquid. The doors swing open
and they carry the Doctor out and away from the Tardis.) <br>
TARON: Right, sit him down here. <br>
(They take off the plastic hoods and gauntlets.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you very much. How did you find me? <br>
TARON: A girl we met. <br>
VABER: She told us where you were. <br>
DOCTOR: Is she all right? <br>
TARON: She should be. <br>
VABER: We left her hiding. <br>
TARON: Circle round the neighbourhood. See if there's any activity. <br>
(Codal leaves.) <br>
VABER: What are you staring at? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry, it's just, just that I thought I knew you. <br>
VABER: That's not likely. <br>
DOCTOR: Where are you from? <br>
TARON: A planet, many systems from here. <br>
DOCTOR: Skaro! Yes, of course, you're Thals! <br>
TARON: How did you know that? <br>
DOCTOR: <a href="1-2.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Because I've been to Skaro,
that's why</a>. <br>
TARON: When? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, many years ago. During the Dalek war. <br>
VABER: Dalek war? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
VABER: That's impossible. That was generations ago. You couldn't have
been there. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can assure you that I was. <br>
TARON: How? <br>
DOCTOR: By travelling through the barriers of time. If you must know, I
was with the Thal group when they broke into the Dalek city. <br>
TARON: In our legend, there is a being, a figure from another planet
who came to Skaro when the Thals were in their greatest peril, in
something called a Tardis. He had three companions with him. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Barbara, Ian and Susan. <br>
VABER: And their leader was called? <br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor. <br>
TARON: Are you trying to tell us that you are the Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. <br>
VABER: That's nonsense! You've come to spy on us. What are you doing on
this planet? Here, of all the planets in the galaxy! Answer! <br>
DOCTOR: Now you listen to me, young man. You may have saved my life,
and I'm grateful, but that does not give you the right to subject me to
an inquisition! <br>
(The Doctor wipes something from his cheek.) <br>
TARON: Vaber, give me the spray. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
VABER: Waste our medical supplies? <br>
TARON: The spray, Vaber. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing? <br>
TARON: You have been infected by a particularly deadly fungus. Close
your eyes. <br>
(Taron sprays the Doctor's face.) <br>
TARON: They spread their spores in that liquid they've discharged. And
the fungus spreads very quickly unless the surface has been specially
treated. Turn your hand over. There, that should be all right now. <br>
DOCTOR: Now? Why, what would have happened? <br>
TARON: Without special treatment it would have spread all over your
body. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, that's nice. <br>
TARON: Until finally, you'd have been engulfed by it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
(Jo has returned to the spaceship and is taking off her jacket. She
sees a growth on the back of her hand, like the stuff on her raincoat.)
<br>
VABER: Come on, let's get started. <br>
TARON: No. We wait for Codal. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, what's the name of this planet? <br>
VABER: Spiridon. One of the nastiest pieces of space garbage in the
ninth system. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it inhabited? <br>
VABER: Oh, yes. Vegetation that's more like animal life than plant,
creatures hostile to everything including themselves and a climate that
changes from tropical in the day to sub-freezing in the night. <br>
DOCTOR: Any intelligent life form? <br>
TARON: Oh, yes. the Spiridons. They're invisible. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm, I'd very much like to see one of them. I mean, I'd very
much like to come into contact with one of them. <br>
VABER: Don't worry, you will. <br>
DOCTOR: You said just now that you were on some sort of mission. May
one ask what it is?&nbsp;<br>
TARON: No, I can't tell you that. That's top secret. <br>
DOCTOR: As you wish. I'm on something of a special mission myself. <br>
VABER: Taron, why can't you face it? <br>
TARON: Now listen <br>
VABER: None of us is ever going to get away from here. <br>
TARON: Vaber! <br>
VABER: The radio's gone, the ship's damaged, we can't take off. We're
on a suicide mission! <br>
TARON: It was your choice. Nobody made you come. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, whatever it was you came here to do, it must be pretty
important. <br>
TARON: We think so. <br>
DOCTOR: How many are there of you? <br>
TARON: There were seven. But our commander was killed on touchdown. And
we've lost three others since. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, only three left. <br>
TARON: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you could make that four if you'd let me help you. Five
with Jo Grant. <br>
TARON: Thanks. I'll think about it. <br>
DOCTOR: You still don't trust me? <br>
TARON: Why should I? You come here out of nowhere and then claim to be
something out of a legend. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your point. But I am on your side, you know? <br>
(Codal returns.) <br>
VABER: Anything about? <br>
CODAL: No, it seems quiet enough. <br>
TARON: You all right now? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, never felt better. <br>
TARON: Good, we'll take you to your friend. <br>
DOCTOR: That's good. <br>
TARON: After that, you're on your own. If you see me signal, dive for
cover quickly and don't make a sound. Understood? <br>
DOCTOR: Understood. <br>
(Jo is lying on the spaceship floor. The fungus has grown half way up
her arm.)

vaguely metallic noise.) <br>
TARON: It's coming this way. It sounds like it's in trouble. What do
you think? <br>
VABER: It could be ray exhaustion. <br>
CODAL: No, light wave sickness. That's what the others had. <br>
(There is a round depression in the ground nearby.) <br>
TARON: Do you think it's deactivated? <br>
CODAL: Well, we can't be sure. <br>
VABER: Let's chance it. <br>
(The group moves forward a little.) <br>
DOCTOR: Spiridons? <br>
CODAL: Here. <br>
(Codal hands the Doctor and Taron an aerosol can each.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's this? Some kind of weapon? <br>
CODAL: A liquid colour spray. <br>

see what we're up against. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor shakes the overgrown pepperpot.) <br>
DOCTOR: Motive power nil. Total loss of vision. Sensor plates not
functioning, and weaponry deactivated. <br>
TARON: You seem to know a good deal about Daleks. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well I've had cause to. This one's something new. I've
never come across Daleks that have mastered invisibility before. <br>
VABER: They haven't mastered it, not completely. <br>
CODAL: As far as we can tell, they can only stay invisible for very
short periods. <br>
TARON: Even so, it gives them quite an advantage. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, a terrifying advantage. Have you any idea how they do it? <br>
TARON: Codal's our scientist. <br>
CODAL: They discovered it by studying the Spiridons. It's an
anti-reflecting light wave. Their problem is that to create the energy
required, they have to generate fantastic power, so they can't sustain
it for very long. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. <br>
CODAL: I'd like to investigate a bit further. Let's lift off the top so
that <br>
DOCTOR: No, don't do that. No, most Daleks have an automatic distress
call. Even when they're deactivated, the transmitter may keep
functioning. <br>
TARON: Thank you, Doctor. Let's go.

scout ahead. We won't be long. <br>
DOCTOR: Taron seems very cautious. <br>
VABER: Too cautious. Things would be different if Miro was still alive.
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh? Who is Miro. <br>
VABER: Expedition commander. He was killed when we landed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry. And Taron, who's he? <br>
VABER: Spacecraft doctor. Next in seniority so he took command. And a
fine mess he's making of it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, do you think so? I thought he seemed to be doing rather
well. <br>
VABER: Do you? Three more dead. Nothing achieved. Nothing even planned.
He'll go on being cautious until we're all killed. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what do you think he should do? <br>
VABER: Oh, we've got explosives and weapons. We could attack the Dalek
laboratory and wipe them all out. <br>
DOCTOR: How many Daleks are there, do you know? <br>
VABER: Well, as far as I know, there's not more than twelve. Just a
scientific group, here to try and learn the technique of invisibility.
One determined attack and we could destroy them all. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me about these creatures that live here, the Spiridons.
Are they invisible at all times? <br>
VABER: As far as I know. <br>
DOCTOR: Are they working with the Daleks? <br>
(A tentacle is moving through the grass.) <br>
VABER: I imagine they've been totally subjugated. The usual Dalek
technique of rule by terror. <br>
DOCTOR: Mass exterminations followed by absolute suppression of the
survivors. I know. <br>
VABER: I hate all this waiting round. I wish he'd get back and we could
get started. <br>
(The tentacle closes in on Vaber. Meanwhile, Taron and Codal take cover
as a Dalek patrol glides past.) <br>
TARON: Probably going out to recover the one we found. <br>
CODAL: That's a pity. <br>
TARON: Let's check out the area in that direction, then get back to the
others. <br>
CODAL: Yeah. <br>
(As the tentacle closes in on Vaber, the Doctor is checking out the
pitcher plants and how they follow movement.) <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating. <br>
VABER: The eyeplants? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>
VABER: They've come in very useful. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, how? <br>
VABER: They get very agitated whenever an invisible Spiridon comes near
them. It's given us a, well, a kind of early warning system. <br>
(Vaber cries out. He is entwined in the tentacle.) <br>
DOCTOR: Vaber! <br>
VABER: Get my knife! <br>
DOCTOR: Hang on! Just hang on! I got it! Quickly, your hand. Let go!
Let it go! Let it go. <br>
(The Doctor severs the tentacle and the plant/animal screams and
withdraws it.) <br>
TARON: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all right. Nothing much. Just that some sort of
tentacle tried to make a breakfast of our friend here. <br>
TARON: Vaber? <br>
VABER: I'm all right. <br>
TARON: Are you sure?&nbsp;<br>
VABER: I said I'm all right! Thanks, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: My pleasure. Made an interesting little object lesson. <br>
VABER: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, just that it shows the need for continued caution, I
think. <br>
VABER: You think I don't know that? I have been here rather longer than
you have. But danger's not going to scare me into doing nothing. <br>
TARON: Vaber. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a considerable difference between courage and reckless
stupidity, you know. <br>
VABER: If I have to die, I want it to be for a better reason than
providing nourishment for a flesh eating tentacle. <br>
CODAL: The eye-plants are moving. <br>
TARON: It's a Spiridon patrol! Quick, over there. <br>
(Meanwhile, Jo leaves the spaceship and collapses. Hearing heavy

DOCTOR: Well, they're all right as far as I know. How are you? <br>
CODAL: I'm fine. Splitting headache, but I'll survive. <br>
DOCTOR: That's good. <br>
CODAL: Why didn't they kill us straight away, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I expect they're saving us for interrogation. They'll want
to know what we're doing on this planet. You know, what you did back
there, leading the searchers away from us, was very courageous. <br>
CODAL: I just didn't give myself time to think. If I had, I certainly
wouldn't have taken the risk. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. I think you're doing yourself rather an
injustice there. If you hadn't acted the way you did, we'd have all
been captured. They give medals for that sort of bravery. <br>
CODAL: Bravery? I've been terrified ever since I landed on this planet.
It's different for Taron and Vaber, they're professionals. They've seen
action before. <br>
DOCTOR: And do you think they're any the less brave because of that? <br>
CODAL: They know how to deal with fear. They're used to living close to
death. I'm not. I'm a scientist, not an adventurer. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, forgive me if I'm wrong, but aren't you a volunteer? <br>
CODAL: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Then you must have known what you were getting into? <br>
CODAL: No. None of us did. We're not a warlike people, Doctor. We've
only just developed space flight. No one had attempted a voyage of this
length before, but every man and woman from my division volunteered.
Over six hundred of them. You see, I didn't even have the courage to be
the odd man out. What are you laughing at? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, you, my friend. You may be a very brilliant scientist but
you have very little understanding of people, particularly yourself.
Courage isn't just a matter of not being frightened, you know. <br>
CODAL: What is it, then? <br>
DOCTOR: It's being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway, just as
you did. <br>
CODAL: I'm not convinced, but thanks anyway. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, well, after that little tutorial on bravery, let's see
if we can find a way of getting out of here. <br>
CODAL: Escape? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, escape. Well, let's take a look in our pockets and see if
we can come up with something that might prove useful. Come on. Turn

you want, a guarantee of safety? <br>
TARON: No, I just want the best possible guarantee of success. Any
attempt that fails is worth nothing. <br>
(Vaber leaves.) <br>
TARON: Codal, that giant refrigeration unit. What did you make of it? <br>
CODAL: It was neutron powered <br>
TARON: Yeah <br>
CODAL: Could run for a thousand years. I'm convinced that somehow it's
vital to the Dalek's survival. <br>
TARON: Why do they need such low temperatures? <br>
CODAL: I can't answer that, but I am sure that refrigeration unit is
the key to our attack. <br>
VABER: Are you saying is we destroy the refrigeration plant, we destroy
the Daleks? <br>
CODAL: Yes. Yes, I think it would wipe them out. <br>
VABER: Then that's it. That's the way we do it. We go in through the
shaft you came out of. Or better still, we lower the bombs down. <br>
TARON: The Daleks wouldn't have left the top of that shaft unguarded. <br>
VABER: We think about that when we get there. If we leave now, we can
be there before light. <br>
TARON: We'll attack, but this has to be planned. Until it is, we'll
wait. <br>
VABER: Wait! Wait! That's all we've heard from you. Why don't you face
it, Taron? Admit what we all know. Be honest. You're afraid. Miro would
have taken action by now. He was a real commander, and he wouldn't have
had her hanging around our necks! <br>

his weapon.) <br>
