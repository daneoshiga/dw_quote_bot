<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A modular building stands in a dense jungle. An
older man with a moustache enters to see a young man apparently asleep
in front of the control desk and viewscreen. He goes over and turns
down the audio of the birdcall in the jungle and moves a piece of
equipment to another desk. The chairs have peoples names printed on
them, like director's chairs. Then he picks up a tribal mask with a
fringe of coloured wool, puts it in front of his face and spins the
young man's chair round to wake him.) <br>
SANDERS: Boo! <br>
(Everyone say Hi to the great <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865262/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Richard Todd</a>.) <br>
HINDLE: Argh! <br>
SANDERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha! What's the matter, boy? Bad dreams, eh? Look,
just a joke, that's all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis is parked in the jungle. Tegan has
been for a walk while Adric and Nyssa play draughts.) <br>
TEGAN: Hello. Who's winning? <br>
ADRIC: I am. <br>
(Tegan moves a piece, Nyssa takes one of Adric's draughts.) <br>
ADRIC: Thank you. <br>
(Adric takes three of Nyssa's pieces.) <br>
ADRIC: She's hopeless in her present state of mind. <br>
NYSSA: Don't exaggerate. I only fainted. <br>
ADRIC: Twice. <br>
TEGAN: Where's the Doctor? <br>
ADRIC: In the Tardis, rigging up a delta wave augmenter for Nyssa. <br>
NYSSA: I'm all right, really. <br>
(Nyssa gets a sudden headache.) <br>
ADRIC: You see? <br>
NYSSA: I can't seem to concentrate, that's all. <br>
TEGAN: Doctor! <br>
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis with a piece of equipment, and wire
between his teeth.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Nearly there. <br>
(The equipment makes a loud tone and they have to shout over it.) <br>
TEGAN: What's wrong with her? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just mild mental disorientation. Nothing that forty eight
hours of induced D-sleep won't cure. <br>
TEGAN: Is that the delta wave augmenter? <br>
(The Doctor switches it off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. There's no need to shout. Come along, Nyssa. <br>
(Tegan helps Nyssa into the Tardis. Adric spots a component of the
DWA.) <br>
ADRIC: That's the sonic screwdriver. <br>
DOCTOR: Well done, Adric. It's functioning as a delta waveform
generator. <br>
ADRIC: What if we need it? <br>
DOCTOR: Why should we need it? <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis, and Tegan comes out.) <br>
TEGAN: I suppose we're stuck here now while she sleeps. <br>
ADRIC: It's beautiful. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SANDERS: No sign of Roberts. <br>
HINDLE: No, sir. Sir, as designated SR security, I would like to
protest at your failure in present dangerous circumstances to institute
an official around-the-clock alert. Furthermore <br>
SANDERS: Wait a minute. <br>
(Sanders switches off the viewscreen. A woman enters in the background,
wearing medical or science whites and carrying a clipboard.) <br>
SANDERS: What dangerous circumstances? <br>
HINDLE: Sir, in my opinion <br>
SANDERS: Your what? <br>
HINDLE: Sir. <br>
SANDERS: Tell him. <br>
TODD: Tell him what? <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0400828/" target="_blank"><font color="#000000"> Nerys
Hughes</font></a>.) <br>
SANDERS: In your opinion, are we in any danger from the primitives? <br>
TODD: I've already told you. <br>
SANDERS: Tell him again! <br>
TODD: The Kinda pose no threat whatsoever to the security of this
expedition. They are culturally non-hostile. <br>
SANDERS: There you are. <br>
TODD: Of course, from their point of view, we might pose a threat to
them. <br>
SANDERS: How do you mean? What point of view could they have? They're
savages. <br>
TODD: There is the matter of the hostages we've taken. <br>
SANDERS: Standard procedure. <br>
TODD: Our procedure, not their. Please give me that. <br>
SANDERS: What? <br>
TODD: The Kinda artefact. Thank you. <br>
HINDLE: Nevertheless, I should like my protest to be entered officially
in the log. <br>
SANDERS: Oh, you would, would you, boy? <br>
HINDLE: Yes, sir. <br>
SANDERS: You're improperly dressed, Mister Hindle. What's more, you
have not brushed your hair. Kindly retire and attend to it. Dismiss! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Windchimes]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor, Adric and Tegan have gone for a walk
in the jungle. The Doctor parts some palm branches to reveal an array
of crystal windchimes hanging from the canopy.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you are, Tegan. There's always something to look at if
you open your eyes. <br>
TEGAN: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Good question. Any ideas? <br>
(Tegan reaches towards them with a stick.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go on, I'm sure it's safe. <br>
(She prods them and they produce individual tones.) <br>
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. That one again. Now that one. A perfect fifth. A
chromatic structure in eccentric sequence. Eccentric, that is, to our
ears, not to the ears of whoever built it. <br>
(Adric runs a stick along the whole array.) <br>
DOCTOR: Adric! <br>
ADRIC: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Adric, don't wander off. Not on a new planet. So, Tegan, the
question is, who built it and what is it for? <br>
(Adric wanders off.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sanders is doing press-ups.) <br>
TODD: You push him too hard. <br>
SANDERS: Nonsense. <br>
TODD: He'll crack. <br>
SANDERS: Think so? <br>
TODD: If you want my opinion <br>
SANDERS: No, thank you. Too many opinions as it is. Meet a few
difficulties and suddenly everybody's got an opinion. That's how things
fall apart. He's a washout. <br>
TODD: Is that your opinion? <br>
(Sanders gets up.) <br>
SANDERS: Yes, it is. The difference is, I'm in charge. <br>
(He starts running on the spot.) <br>
SANDERS: I'll tell you something. I welcome these difficulties. It was
all too easy around here. I was starting to feel at home. First time
ever, anywhere, in forty years. And that, when you're a couple of dozen
parsecs off home world, can be a dangerous feeling to have. I think so,
don't you? <br>
TODD: Which still leaves us with the question, where is Roberts? <br>
SANDERS: It does. <br>
TODD: And the others. <br>
SANDERS: I know, yes. <br>
TODD: There are now only three of us left. <br>
SANDERS: I can count! <br>
TODD: Well? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Windchimes]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Of course, to build this, to achieve the
delicate resonances involved, would require a high level of technical
skill. And yet, look around you. No signs of civilisation, no
cultivation, no roadways, even. And yet whoever built this must have a
musical sense not unlike, not entirely unlike, our own. Are you sure
you're all right? <br>
(Tegan has been standing gazing at nothing.) <br>
TEGAN: What? Yes, yes, I'm fine. Just a bit sleepy, that's all. <br>
DOCTOR: Must be the fresh air. It's very puzzling, don't you think? <br>
(Tegan has sat down and is falling asleep.) <br>
ADRIC [OC]: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Now where's he got to? <br>
(The sounds of the chimes enter Tegan's head.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Adric has found a man-sized object with an open
door.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, Adric! <br>
(The Doctor grabs Adric and drags him away.) <br>
ADRIC: What the? What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Whatever it is, it could be distinctly unfriendly. Look at it. <br>
ADRIC: Direct beam. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. It's obviously an armoured suit of some kind. I would say
its occupant was probably human in shape <br>
(The Doctor sits inside it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Binocular, bipedal, and the whole thing is controlled directly
from the brain of the wearer with these. <br>
(Antennae protruding from the walls either side of his head.) <br>
ADRIC: But where is he? <br>
(The Doctor gets out and goes over to a tray of fruit lying on the
ground.) <br>
DOCTOR: Or she, or <br>
(Adric shuts the door of the Suit.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, Adric! <br>
(The Suit comes to life.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stand still. Don't move. Not a muscle. <br>
(Back at the group of young local people find Tegan. They are carrying
fruit. <br>
Meanwhile, the Suit is marching the Doctor and Adric through the jungle
at gunpoint.) <br>
ADRIC: I'm sorry. I suppose it must have some sort of autocontrol
function. So it can work with no one in it. <br>
DOCTOR: Adric. <br>
ADRIC: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: There is a difference between serious scientific investigation
and meddling. <br>
ADRIC: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Isn't there? <br>
ADRIC: Yes! <br>
(At the windchimes, a young boy puts a garland of purple flowers around
Tegan's shoulders, then the group quietly tiptoes away. They have left
fruit at her feet.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside Earth dome]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Suit clunks to a halt.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's better. <br>
(Adric gestures that they run.) <br>
DOCTOR: No. Besides, it looks as if we've arrived. <br>
(The Suit herds them up the ramp and inside the dome. The contraption
fills the entrance area, backing the pair up against a door which then
slides up.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Dome passageway]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sanders and Hindle stand there. Hindle has his
hand weapon raised. This is the item that Sanders had moved to the
table at the top of the show.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, I was right. Two arms, binocular, bipedal. Human, or
humanoid at the very least. I'm delighted to meet you. <br>
HINDLE: Stay where you are. <br>
DOCTOR: Intentions unknown. Hypothesis unfriendly, as K9 would say. <br>
HINDLE: Where's Roberts? <br>
DOCTOR: Roberts? Was Roberts <br>
HINDLE: Answer the question! <br>
DOCTOR: I'd be very pleased to. It's a little difficult to concentrate <br>
(Sanders makes Hindle lower the weapon. Todd comes along the passage.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
SANDERS: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid we can't help you. The, er, thing was empty
when we came across it. <br>
SANDERS: What are you doing on S14? <br>
DOCTOR: S14? <br>
TODD: Deva Loka. Land of the Kinda. <br>
DOCTOR: The Kinda are the native lifeform. <br>
TODD: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Who built the chimes. <br>
TODD: Yes. <br>
SANDERS: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Could you repeat the question? <br>
SANDERS: What are you doing on S14? <br>
DOCTOR: Just passing through. Look, I don't suppose there's a chance of
some breakfast? Are you hungry, Adric? Adric? He usually is. Boys, you
know. If you could oblige? Look, if we turn out to be hostile, then
fair enough. Until we do, why not give us the benefit of the doubt?
It's commonsense really, don't you think? <br>
SANDERS: Follow me. <br>
(At the windchimes, Tegan opens her eyes and finds herself standing in
a black void.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Adric are eating breakfast at the
table while Todd studies papers.) <br>
SANDERS: You know something? This is my fourteenth ex and rec, and I've
never seen a planet like this one. Look at it. Paradise, isn't it? The
sun shines, the birds sing, food grows on trees. Even the ILF is
friendly. Or used to be. <br>
DOCTOR: The ILF? <br>
TODD: Intelligent Life Form. <br>
SANDERS: The primitives. <br>
DOCTOR: The Kinda. <br>
(The Doctor gives Adric his breakfast plate.) <br>
TODD: Yes. <br>
SANDERS: Oh, you're not eating. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, no, no. I don't seem to be very, er. These difficulties you
referred to? <br>
SANDERS: Well, go on, tell him. Why not? <br>
TODD: Originally there were six of us. <br>
DOCTOR: Roberts? <br>
TODD: And two more before him. They disappeared. Simply haven't
returned to the dome. <br>
DOCTOR: What, do you think the Kinda took them? <br>
TODD: Impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: Are the Kinda dangerous? <br>
SANDERS: We don't know. You see, with the Kinda, they seem innocent
enough, and they smile a lot, or they used to. <br>
DOCTOR: Used to? <br>
SANDERS: Until we took the hostages. <br>
DOCTOR: The hostages? <br>
SANDERS: Only a couple. Standard procedure. It's in the manual. <br>
DOCTOR: Could I see them? <br>
SANDERS: Why would you want to do that? <br>
DOCTOR: I've a friend still in the forest. I'm quite concerned for her
safety. I'd like to know how much of a threat the Kinda are. <br>
HINDLE: Sir, I must protest! <br>
SANDERS: Yes, of course. Why not. Todd'll show you. They're not very
interesting though. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Black void]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan comes across a metal structure, then two
people sitting at a small round table playing a game similar to
draughts. They glow white. The woman is dressed in Tudor style, with a
big ruff framing her head. The man's ruff is very small around his
neck.) <br>
TEGAN: Hello.<br>
(The woman replies.) <br>
ANATTA: You, my dear, cannot possibly exist, so go away. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Laboratory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor shines a light in the two Kinda's
eyes. He is inside the small cage where the men are being held.) <br>
TODD: Sanders doesn't think they're ill. He thinks they're sulking. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Complete lack of neuromuscular reaction. They're not
sulking. Shock, wouldn't you think, in the circumstances? Your arrival
here must have come as something of a surprise, and then to lock them
up. <br>
TODD: I argued against it. It's totally illogical. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, illogical. Please let me out of here. Have you any idea of
the affect upon a primitive mind <br>
TODD: Primitive? Is that what you think? I'm not so sure. Does that
design remind you of anything? <br>
(Todd points to the decoration the Kinda wear on their chest - two
intertwined lines of different colours with a vertical strip holding
three red balls. She opens the cage.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it could be the double helix. <br>
TODD: It is. The heart of the chromosome. They all wear them. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. What could they know of molecular biology? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Black void]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Look, hello. <br>
ANATTA: Did you see? <br>
ANICCA: Why, did you? <br>
ANATTA: I asked first. <br>
ANICCA: So you did see. <br>
ANATTA: It proves nothing. Because an illusion is shared doesn't mean <br>
ANICCA: Of course not. <br>
ANATTA: Besides, how do I know that what you think you see <br>
ANICCA: Is what you think you see? <br>
ANATTA: Or vice <br>
(As they both move pieces on their game board, we see they have the
image of a snake on their forearms.) <br>
ANICCA: Versa. <br>
ANATTA: Exactly. <br>
(A younger man appears behind Tegan, laughs, and vanishes. The two
figures recede into the distance.) <br>
ANICCA: I can only conclude it is you who have invented her as a means
of putting me off my game. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Laboratory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TODD: There are no predatory animals on Deva Loka.
No diseases, no adverse environmental factors. The climate is constant
within a five degree range and the trees fruit in sequence all the year
round. <br>
DOCTOR: Which means the Kinda have no need of shelter and no fears for
food supply. <br>
TODD: Right. And there's something else. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
TODD: I think the Kinda are telepathic. </font></p>

TEGAN: I suppose you're also going to tell me I don't exist. Well? <br>
DUKKHA: Don't be silly. Of course you exist. How could you be here if
you didn't exist? <br>
TEGAN: But where am I? <br>
DUKKHA: Guess. <br>
TEGAN: What? <br>
DUKKHA: Go on. <br>
TEGAN: It looks to me like the middle of nowhere. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TODD: They can't speak. They have no language and
yet they can communicate. Take no notice of me, Doctor. It's only a
guess, and guesses are not science. Have an apple. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought the native produce was forbidden. <br>
TODD: I'm a scientist. I do not feel bound by Hindle's stupid
precautions. Beautiful, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
TODD: You heard Sanders. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
TODD: Paradise, he called it. Perhaps he said more than he knew. </font></p>

DUKKHA: I'll tell you. <br>
TEGAN: Why do you wear that thing? <br>
(The snake on the arm.) <br>
DUKKHA: Why shouldn't I? <br>
TEGAN: The old couple playing chess wore the same design. <br>
DUKKHA: They would. <br>
TEGAN: Why? <br>
DUKKHA: Because we're the same. <br>
TEGAN: As what? <br>
DUKKHA: Each other. </font></p>

in the cage look up and Todd gets a shiver down her spine. The Doctor
is looking out of the window.) <br>
DOCTOR: There's a Kinda out there now. <br>
TODD: Yes. Strange, he's often there. The others keep well away. <br>
DOCTOR: He doesn't look as if he's living in paradise. <br>
TODD: No, he doesn't, does he. <br>
(The young man goes back into the trees.) <br>
DOCTOR: What are your plans for this planet? <br>
TODD: If I told you that, Hindle would have a fit. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well, of course, if Hindle would have a fit. <br>
TODD: The mother ship returns in six seasons. If we've survived, we
will submit a report which will be assessed with a view to
colonisation. <br>
(Hindle overhears her as he enters.) <br>
TODD: Our mother world is very overcrowded. <br>
HINDLE: What have you two been talking about? <br>
TODD: I beg your pardon! <br>
HINDLE: I want to know. <br>
TODD: What gives you the right? This is my laboratory! <br>
HINDLE: I am designated SR security. <br>
TODD: What do you want? <br>
HINDLE: Sanders wants to see you. Both. What's that? Give it to me. The
manual strictly forbids <br>
TODD: Does it really? <br>
(She puts her half-eaten apple into Hindle's hand and storms out.) <br>
DOCTOR: An apple a day keeps the er. No, never mind. <br>
(The Doctor leaves. After a moment, Hindle throws down the fruit then
smashes Todd's plant samples and overturns the chairs before becoming
calm again. He picks up an hexagonal mirror to tidy his hair, and sees
one of the Kinda in it. He looks around.) </font></p>

away, Mister Hindle will be in charge. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think that's <br>
SANDERS: Yes? What? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. <br>
SANDERS: Good. Oh, I know the nonsense she's been filling your head
with. Well, answer me this. If the Kinda are so clever, how is it they
didn't build their own interplanetary vehicle and come and colonise us?
<br>
TODD: I don't quite see what that <br>
SANDERS: The point is, they're just a bunch of ignorant savages. <br>
ADRIC: Mister Sanders, are you going in that machine? <br>
SANDERS: The Total Survival Suit? Yes, of course. Why? <br>
ADRIC: Well, I was just thinking that if that machine has malfunctioned
in some way then that might explain what happened to Roberts. <br>
SANDERS: Good thinking, boy. Well done. Yes, that's what this situation
needs. Good, down the line, practical thought, that's all. Yes, yes, I
think you've hit it right on the nail. </font></p>

TEGAN: It's a bit obvious, isn't it? <br>

back again.) <br>

brings them back for the Trickster to choose. Both hands turn out

middle. He performs a series of tumbles, then a cartwheel, but he falls
and injures his back. He writhes in pain as Aris's laugh echoes.) <br>

DOCTOR: We can't. <br>

take the panels away as the Doctor joins Todd, Adric and Tegan with
Aris.) <br>
DOCTOR: He'll be all right. <br>
TODD: Why do such things exist? <br>
DOCTOR: Who can tell? <br>
TODD: The Mara's gone. <br>
DOCTOR: Back to the dark places of the inside, or wherever. But not
here, not anywhere here. This world is free of it. <br>
KARUNA: And of its curse. <br>
TODD: Curse? <br>
KARUNA: Yes. <br>
TODD: What curse? <br>
KARUNA: The curse of time. It is the Mara which starts the clocks. <br>
(Todd is totally baffled.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, it's finished. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HINDLE: I suppose everything will have to be
entered into the log. <br>
SANDERS: Will it? <br>
HINDLE: Well, the manual states it's the duty of the expedition
commander to <br>
SANDERS: What manual? <br>
HINDLE: Oh. I see. <br>
SANDERS: I never read the manual. <br>
HINDLE: Thank you. <br>
SANDERS: Thank you, sir. <br>
HINDLE: (saluting) Thank you, sir. <br>
(Elsewhere.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is it decided? <br>
TODD: They accepted my recommendation. <br>
DOCTOR: Which is? <br>
TODD: This planet is totally unsuitable for full scale colonisation.
The unit be withdrawn. Sanders is pleased. <br>
(Hindle and Sanders cross the path behind them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is he? <br>
TODD: He wants to stay here. I told him he should just wander off into
the forest. Nobody'd notice. Shame about poor old Hindle, though. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right. He was just driven out of his mind.
Just what he needed. What about you, will you stay? <br>
TODD: I don't think so. <br>
DOCTOR: You're not tempted by paradise? <br>
TODD: It was all right at first, but it's all a bit too green for me. <br>
NYSSA [OC]: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, one moment. <br>
(Adric, Tegan and Nyssa are standing in front of the Tardis.) <br>
TODD: You don't actually go into space in that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no. That would be completely impossible, wouldn't it. <br>
TODD: Unlikely, anyway. <br>
DOCTOR: If not ridiculous. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It seems some people are getting impatient. <br>
(The Kinda gather.) <br>
TODD: You must go. Goodbye. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye. <br>
NYSSA: Hello, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Nyssa, how are you? <br>
NYSSA: Fully recovered. <br>
DOCTOR: Excellent. <br>
NYSSA: What have you been doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing much. This and that. Having fun. <br>
NYSSA: Can we go? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't see why not. <br>
(Tegan, Nyssa and Adric enter the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think paradise is a little too green for me as well. </font>
