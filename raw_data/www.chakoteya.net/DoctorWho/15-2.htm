MEEKER: Going to manual. <br>
SILVEY: What for? <br>
MEEKER: Why not? If we're going to be slammed around, I'd sooner do it
myself. <br>
SILVEY: It's still telling you what to do. <br>
MEEKER: Yes, but at least I'm doing it. <br>

SILVEY: Come on, Meeker. <br>

SAFRAN: You're off course. <br>
MEEKER: Yes, sorry, skipper. <br>
SAFRAN: Put it back on automatic, please. <br>
(Meeker turns off the alarm and presses a lot of buttons.) <br>
MEEKER: Eh? I can't! <br>
(Safran goes to a computer panel.) <br>
SAFRAN: Titan shuttle captain. New course for Titan, please. <br>
(He goes up to Meeker.) <br>
SAFRAN: All right, Meeker, that is enough. <br>
MEEKER: What? <br>
SAFRAN: Off watch. Please. <br>
(Meeker gives up his seat to Safran and goes down to sit with Silvey.) <br>
MEEKER: Look, I qualified for exploration eight years ago, and what am
I? Glorified garage attendant on some planetary filling station. <br>
SILVEY: Your turn'll come. You'll be glad enough of refuel bases then. <br>
MEEKER: All I'm saying is that I want a real <br>

fires electricity at it.) <br>

captain. Report please. <br>

loincloth, and currently carrying the coat stand back into a proper
shiny, metallic console room. No more wooden claustrophobia.) <br>

DOCTOR: You've never been in here before. <br>
LEELA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Number two control room has been closed for redecoration. I
don't like the colour. <br>
LEELA: White isn't a colour. <br>
DOCTOR: That's the trouble with computers. Always think in black and
white. No aquamarines, no blues, no imagination. <br>

LEELA: Have we stopped? <br>
DOCTOR: No, we haven't stopped. <br>

LEELA: Have we materialised? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Solar system, between Jupiter and Saturn. About five thousand
AD. Five thousand AD? We're still in the time of your ancestors. <br>
LEELA: Ancestors? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. That was the year of the great breakout. <br>
LEELA: The great what? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. When your forefathers went leapfrogging across the solar
system on their way to the stars. Asteroid belt's probably teeming with
them now. New frontiersmen, pioneers waiting to spread across the
galaxy like a tidal wave. Or a disease. <br>
LEELA: Why disease? I thought you liked humanity? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I do, I do. Some of my best friends are humans. When they
get together in great numbers, other lifeforms sometimes suffer. </font></p>

underground on a massive lift. It's cargo doors are open to reveal two
large circular containers. As the ship is transported along a tunnel,
the crew put on their helmets and prepare to disembark.) <br>

on. Get your gear off and relax. You're going to be here for <br>

MAN: Hey, what kind of a joke is <br>
(The spacemen shoot them. Safran walks over to check the bodies. He
raises his visor to reveal a strange scaly substance growing over the
skin around his eyes.) <br>
SAFRAN: There is one other. The station supervisor. We must find him,
destroy him. <br>
(Silvey and Meeker raise their visors. They have the same affliction.) <br>
SAFRAN: Then we can make this the ideal place in which to breed and
multiply. </font></p>

Come in, please. Shuttle relief crew, this is Supervisor Lowe. Please
report. Relief crew, this is the supervisor. Where are you? <br>

dead men in the mess.) <br>
LOWE: My God, what's happened? Hello? Hello? <br>
(He activates a second monitor, which shows Safran.) <br>
LOWE: What is it? What's gone wrong? <br>
SAFRAN: Wrong? There is nothing wrong. This is most suitable for our
purpose. What, what purpose? Safran. Safran, is that you? What has
happened? <br>
SAFRAN: Who is this Safran? <br>
(Lowe hits an emergency broadcast button.) <br>
LOWE: Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Titan Base. Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday! <br>
(He sounds the general alarm, locks the door and grabs a helmet from a
shelf before heading for the emergency exit - labelled Imurjinsee
Egsit. Silvey and Meeker arrive outside and start cutting into the room
but they are too late. Safran enters after them.) <br>
MEEKER: The supervisor has escaped. <br>
SAFRAN: Leave him. Let him suffocate. <br>

really interesting. <br>
LOWE [OC]: Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Titan Base. Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday! <br>
LEELA: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Distress call. From Titan. That message took half an hour to
get here. <br>
LEELA: Is Titan really interesting? <br>
DOCTOR: What does that matter? What's important is that someone needs
help. Quadrant six two. WHI1212. 9990EX41. <br>
(Leela is holding on tightly to the end of his scarf.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter? <br>
LEELA: I'm troubled. <br>
DOCTOR: About what? <br>
LEELA: I can feel something. <br>
DOCTOR: Hey. <br>
SAFRAN [OC]: Titan. This is Titan Base. All vessels, repeat, all
vessels disregard mayday. I say again, disregard mayday. All under

DOCTOR: There we are. <br>
SAFRAN [OC]: Our apologies. Our apologies. <br>
LEELA: That's it! <br>
DOCTOR: That's what? <br>
LEELA: That's something evil. <br>
SAFRAN [OC]: Titan Base out. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: It was not a human speaking. <br>
DOCTOR: It wasn't? <br>
(The Tardis is passing through the same electro-phenomenon as the
shuttle did earlier. A small component on the console explodes and the
Doctor is briefly surrounded by a purple glow.) <br>
LEELA: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Static. Nothing important. <br>
LEELA: There was a sort of glow all around you. <br>
DOCTOR: There was? Oh. Well, a kind of Saint Elmo's fire. It happens at
sea. <br>
LEELA: Saint Elmo's? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it causes a sort of halo effect round the masts of ships. <br>
LEELA: Halo? <br>
DOCTOR: Why do you keep repeating everything I say? You're not a
parrot, are you? <br>
LEELA: Parrot? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. A parrot's a bird that repeats things. Move over. <br>
LEELA: (deep) Move over. <br>
DOCTOR: That's it. <br>
(Bang! from inside the console.) <br>
LEELA: I thought you said there was nothing wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there isn't anything wrong. Well, there isn't anything
important wrong, but I've got to check it, haven't I? <br>
LEELA: I can still feel it. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, old thing. Come on. <br>

sways.) <br>

figure watches though a window.) </font></p>

LEELA: What did you say? <br>
DOCTOR: I said, I'm perfectly all right, thank you, Lalee. <br>
LEELA: My name is Leela. <br>

LEELA: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Must have had a bot of a shik. <br>
LEELA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: A bot of a shik. <br>
LEELA: Doctor, what is it? What's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a voice or something in my head. <br>
LEELA: The evil thing. <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense. Just a nasty turn. Come on, we're on Titan. Let's
take a look. <br>
(The Doctor opens the doors, then walks straight into one.) <br>
DOCTOR: That was odd. <br>
LEELA: Doctor, don't go out. <br>
(Leela closes the doors.) <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: It's out there. Evil! <br>
(Meanwhile, Lowe goes back into the Base and grabs a weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: We must go. We've had a mayday. <br>
LEELA: No. I can feel it is wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: What, intuition? <br>
LEELA: I don't care what you call it, Doctor. I knew. I knew before
that. Before you were affected. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you talking about, affected? <br>
LEELA: Well, before you were knocked out. <br>
DOCTOR: Leela, listen to me. I'm perfectly all right. Move over. </font></p>

behind a door labelled Kryogenics Sexshun. Safran and Meeker follow
him.) <br>
SAFRAN: Close the door. Turn off the oxygen supply. <br>
(The Doctor briefly looks out of the Tardis, goes back inside then
comes out again a few moments later. Leela follows slowly, knife
ready.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nobody around. Not a soul. <br>
(The Doctor sounds a duck call.) <br>
DOCTOR: Anyone home? <br>
LEELA: Doctor, look. <br>
(They go to Silvey's body.) <br>
DOCTOR: Disregard mayday. He said disregard mayday. Why? <br>
LEELA: It is still warm. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't be gruesome. <br>
LEELA: I am a hunter. <br>
DOCTOR: You're a savage. <br>
LEELA: Perhaps. I'm not ashamed of what I am and I tell you, Doctor, I
can smell danger. <br>
DOCTOR: What did you say? <br>
LEELA: I said, I can smell danger. <br>
DOCTOR: Evil again? <br>
LEELA: Everywhere. In this place. <br>
DOCTOR: We'd better find it before it finds us. <br>
LEELA: Right. <br>

LEELA: I'm no coward. <br>

returns, walking backwards.) <br>

DOCTOR: Excuse me, you don't know me. Let me introduce myself. <br>
SAFRAN: There is no need. We are preparing the hives now. <br>
DOCTOR: People call me the D. Hives? <br>
SAFRAN: For the nucleus which you carry within you. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right? I answered your mayday. <br>
(Safran and Meeker turn, and the Doctor sees the silver growths on
their faces. He backs away a little.) <br>
SAFRAN: You answered the call? <br>
DOCTOR: That's right, that's right. Has someone been hurt? <br>
SAFRAN: It is of no consequence. The physical envelope is of no
importance. <br>
MEEKER: Of no importance. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, of no importance? I just found a dead body
out there. <br>
(Energy passes between Meeker and the Doctor.) <br>
MEEKER: Now that you have arrived. <br>
DOCTOR: I have arrived. <br>
SAFRAN: All that matters is that the reject should be destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: Reject should be destroyed. <br>
SAFRAN: And breeding begin. <br>
DOCTOR: And breeding from my nucleus begin. <br>
(Leela finds the Kryogenics door and opens it. Lowe topples out,
covered in ice. She drags him away. Meanwhile, Safran gives the Doctor
his weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Leela the reject will not suspect me. <br>

already killed these poor devils. <br>
LEELA: But why? Are they your enemies? <br>
LOWE: No. I know them. At least, I thought I did. But they've changed. <br>
LEELA: How changed? <br>
LOWE: Their eyes, their manner, their whole behaviour is different. One
of them said something. <br>

present seated in the mind-brain interface and therefore having no
ascertainable mass or structure, master. <br>

come up with a brand new infection, is it, Parsons? <br>

DOCTOR: Self-preservation. Whatever it is I'm suffering from seems to
thrive on intellectual activity. <br>
MARIUS: Oh, I see. You mean that the harder you think, the more of a
grip it seems to take? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Non-thinking is the only way to shake it off, but I can't
stay mindless for eternity, can I. <br>

DOCTOR: Ah. Hello. <br>
K9: Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: How are you? <br>
MARIUS: Well, he seems to think that it's noetic in character, that
means it's only detectable during consciousness. <br>
DOCTOR: I know what noetic means. <br>
MARIUS: I'm sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: Mind-brain interface. <br>
MARIUS: Well, if it exists. <br>
DOCTOR: But of course. How stupid. That's why it attacked the Tardis
computer first. It was showing the greatest amount of mental activity.
I was just idling, so to speak. <br>
MARIUS: When was this? <br>
DOCTOR: When we were first attacked. We were on our way to Titan. I
assumed it was just a static build-up. Then when I checked the
computer, it jumped into my mind, and that explains why Leela was <br>

DOCTOR: Why Leela was unaffected. Have you met Leela? <br>
MARIUS: No. <br>
DOCTOR: She's all instinct and intuition. <br>
MARIUS: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: That's why the virus rejected her. Of course. I begin to see it
all now. <br>
MARIUS: Well, it's possible, it's possible. Was anyone else exposed to
it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. The entire crew on Titan. Well, one exception. The
supervisor, man called Lowe. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MARIUS: Good luck, Doctor. <br>
(Leela enters the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Professor. Oh, Professor. <br>
MARIUS: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't suppose we could borrow K9, could we? <br>
MARIUS: Borrow K9? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
MARIUS: What for? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not at liberty to say, but he could be very useful. <br>
MARIUS: Of course. I understand. K9, obey the Doctor. <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
(The Doctor and K9 enter the Tardis, and it dematerialises.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Lowe posts guards in the corridor outside the
hive. Safran watches the spawning on a monitor, but leaves as the
Tardis materialises.) <br>
LEELA: Doctor, what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: They're starting to hatch. Let's go. <br>
(He opens the door and slams it shut again.) <br>
LEELA: Now what's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a man at the door. <br>
(Leela squats down, gun ready. There is knock on the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come in. <br>
(The door opens, and Leela starts shooting. Her weapon has little
effect, and the man only collapses when K9 shoots his leg.) <br>
LEELA: Thank you, K9. Well, Doctor, what's wrong? Why didn't my blaster
work? <br>
DOCTOR: They're developing a resistance to radiation. Their internal
cell structure <br>
K9: Problem. I have a problem. Offensive capability seriously
diminished. Reserves very low. <br>
LEELA: K9's breaking up, my blaster's finished. What are we going to
do? <br>
DOCTOR: Shall we try using our intelligence? <br>
LEELA: Well, if you think that's a good idea. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Base corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: (sotto) K9, do you see that guard? <br>
K9: (sotto) Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) I want you to decoy him. <br>
(The man follows K9 down the corridor, firing at him as he goes. Safran
and Lowe are talking outside the hive when K9 rejoins the Doctor and
Leela.) <br>
K9: Mission accomplished. <br>
DOCTOR: Good dog. Your turn now, Leela. See you back at the Tardis. <br>
LEELA: Or not. Good luck, Doctor. You know we should have done what I
said. <br>
DOCTOR: What was that? <br>
LEELA: Blow them up. Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
(Lowe and Safran take cover as K9 approaches. Lowe keeps firing at K9
then kicks him into the rock wall. <br>
The Doctor walks up to the now unguarded hive, but there is blaster
fire and he drops the box of antidote.) <br>
LOWE: Your futile attempt has failed, as we knew it would. Now you will
join the Nucleus. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'd rather not, actually. <br>
LOWE: You have no choice. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh look, look, they appear to be hatching. Are congratulations
in order? <br>
(Lowe opens the door to the hive.) <br>
LOWE: You will join the Swarm to be consumed, to become part of our
purpose! <br>
(K9 shoots Lowe in the back, the Doctor grabs him and pushes him into
the hive.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well done, K9, well done. Come on. Let's get out of here while
there's still time. <br>
K9: I cannot. All reserves finished. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Come on. <br>
(K9's lights go out. The Doctor attaches a lead to him and drags him
away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
NUCLEUS: Come back, Doctor. We need you. <br>
(Leela takes up position by a large Oxygen tank. Safran comes along and
she jumps down onto him, stabbing him in the neck. The Doctor and K9
arrive.) <br>
LEELA: Did you kill it? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I lost the antibodies. <br>
LEELA: What? Never mind, Doctor, I've found the answer. <br>
DOCTOR: You have? <br>
LEELA: Knife them in the neck. <br>
DOCTOR: Can you do that to a thousand? A thousand thousand? <br>
LEELA: What are we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: That's a good idea. Take K9 back to the Tardis. He's out of
juice. <br>
(The Doctor opens the valve to the oxygen tank, goes back to the hive
and wires the door shut then goes to valve on its side.) <br>
NUCLEUS [OC]: Who's there? <br>
(The Doctor pulls a tube from the sided of the hive.) <br>
NUCLEUS [OC]: Is that you, Time Lord? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, as far as I know, there's no one else except you and me
here, so it must be me. <br>
(Amidst the steam, the Doctor does something clever to the door of the
hive, attaching a blaster to the handle.) <br>
NUCLEUS [OC]: You're finished, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Not quite. <br>
NUCLEUS [OC]: There's no escape for you now. You are destined to become
part of the purpose. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that depends on how long it's going to take you to get
out of there. <br>
NUCLEUS [OC]: Fool. Do you think a metal barrier can contain the Swarm?

crouched by the desk, into the Tardis. It dematerialises.) <br>

LEELA: Why did you not wait? <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises again. The Nucleus finally forces the hive
door open and the whole place goes up in flames. The Doctor laughs as
they watch the firework display on the scanner.) <br>
LEELA: Is it gone? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: All of it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Methane atmosphere. Mix well with oxygen and run. That was
a good idea of mine, K9, to blow it up. <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
LEELA: What do you mean, it was a good idea of yours. It was my idea. <br>
DOCTOR: What was? <br>
LEELA: To blow it up. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, you should be feeling very happy. <br>
LEELA: Yes, I am. Shall we return K9 to the Professor? </font></p>

MARIUS: Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you for everything you've done for
us. <br>
DOCTOR: It's been a pleasure, Professor. It's been a pleasure. Do you
know that without K9 I think we'd have been part of the Swarm by now. <br>
LEELA: We'd never have managed with out him. Her. It. Sorry, K9. <br>
K9: Apologies are not necessary, but thank you, mistress. <br>
MARIUS: I think K9 has taken to you. Oh. Actually, I have to return to
Earth shortly and you could do me a great favour if <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: Take K9 with us? <br>
MARIUS: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
LEELA: Yes! Oh, please, Doctor, please, please, let's take him. <br>
(K9 goes into the Tardis.) <br>
MARIUS: K9 seems to have made up his own mind. <br>
(The Doctor and Leela go into the Tardis. Marius sniffs and wipes his
nose.) <br>
MARIUS: I only hope he's Tardis trained. <br>
