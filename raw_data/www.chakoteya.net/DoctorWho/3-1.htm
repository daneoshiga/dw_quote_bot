<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Vicki is giving Steven a haircut. The Doctor is
busy at the controls.) <br>
VICKI: Arrived, have we? <br>
DOCTOR: We have, my dear. <br>
STEVEN: Good. Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we should know about that when we have a look at the
scanner, shan't we. Now, you can both take a look. <br>
STEVEN: Where are we, Doctor? Is it a planet you recognise? <br>
VICKI: Keep still, you nuisance! It's <br>
STEVEN: I just want to know where we are. <br>
DOCTOR: Quiet, both of you, will you?! Listen. Listen. <br>
STEVEN: Listen to what? I can't hear a thing. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Exactly. There isn't a sound out there. Not a sound!
Just silence. <br>
(The Doctor reexamines the Tardis' instruments. Everything seems to be
in satisfactory working order.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the atmospheric pressure's quite normal. Oxygen,
temperature, radiation. It's all quite normal. I wonder. Hmm. I wonder
if it's possible to have a planet so obviously conducive to life and
yet without any? <br>
VICKI: Well, I've finished chopping this fellow. Could we go out and
see? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why not, my child. It appears absolutely
deserted. As a matter of fact, I think we shall get some long-deserved,
undisturbed peace for once. <br>
(On a rocky slope above the Tardis, a squat dome-shaped machine appears
and moves towards the ship. Steven is more concerned with his new
haircut.) <br>
STEVEN: Not bad. It's a bit amateurish, really. <br>
VICKI: Oh, come on. <br>
STEVEN: Hey, you know, there might be a lake or a river around, Doctor.
Do you fancy a swim? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear young man, this isn't a joy ride. This is a scientific
expedition. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, come off it, Doctor. You can't be scientific all the time.
Anyway, you look as if you could do with a good wash-down. <br>
VICKI: What, get him in cold water? You'll be lucky. <br>
DOCTOR: From past experience, we must always be on our guard. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, well I'm prepared to take the risk. <br>
(Outside, the robot reaches the Tardis and collides with it.) <br>
VICKI: What's that? <br>
STEVEN: Well, are we all ready, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Shh, shh! <br>
(The robot bumps into the Tardis again, then slowly turns to the right,
remaining in contact with the outside of the ship, feeling its way
along the side. At the corner, it stops, then nudges its way round and
proceeds along the next side.) <br>
STEVEN: What's going on? <br>
VICKI: Something is feeling it's way around the ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Like something trying to discover by touch. Something
blind. <br>
VICKI: It's just reaching this corner now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it is blind. <br>
VICKI: Whatever it is. <br>
DOCTOR: As you say, my dear, whatever it is. <br>
(Completing its circuit of the Tardis, the machine stops. After a
moment it moves away from the ship, coming into view on the Tardis
scanner. A light on top of the machine begins to flash.) <br>
DOCTOR: Just look, now. Now look, that's something quite different,
isn't it? <br>
STEVEN: You know, Doctor, it looks to me as if it's sending some kind
of message. What do you think? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it might be that. To its controller, whoever it might
be. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, or whatever it might be. <br>
VICKI: Oh, look. It's got a sort of chumbley movement. <br>
STEVEN: Chumbley? <br>
VICKI: Yes, you know, all sort of chumbley. <br>
DOCTOR: It's gone now. <br>
STEVEN: Bang goes my swimming. <br>
VICKI: Oh, it doesn't take much to put you off. A sweet little thing
like that? <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I must be wrong, child. There is life out there. Yes,
a very intelligent, highly intelligent life, to build machines like
that. <br>
VICKI: Chumbley. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Chumbley, if you like, my child. <br>
STEVEN: You know, Doctor, that thing might have been dangerous. What
are we going to do about it? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm going to find out. Come along, my child, and bring my
stick.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Oh, it's delightful. Yes, thank you. Just
about the right amount of oxygen. <br>
VICKI: Mmm. I can smell flowers. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, indeed, how delightful. Well, there's one thing child,
there's no Chumblies about. <br>
STEVEN: Vicki. Look at this. <br>
VICKI: Three suns? <br>
STEVEN: Yes, I wonder which one we're revolving around. <br>
VICKI: Oh look, there's those flowers that I could smell. Hey, they're
roses. No, they're not. Not quite roses, but almost. <br>
DOCTOR: This silence reminds of the planet Xeros. <br>
VICKI: You don't think we've jumped the time track again, do you? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, my dear, not again, not again, but it's so quiet. <br>
STEVEN: It's almost too quiet. <br>
VICKI: Doctor! A Chumbley! <br>
(The Chumbley points a rod-like appendage at them from beneath its
dome.) <br>
STEVEN: That one looks pretty vicious, Doctor. Is that a gun? <br>
DOCTOR: Stand still, otherwise we all might be killed. We come in
peace. We don't wish you any harm. <br>
VICKI: He can't speak. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but by the look of that thing sticking out in front, it's
unmistakably like a speaker to me. <br>
VICKI: It's trying to talk. Steven, look out! <br>
DOCTOR: You dumb fool! <br>
STEVEN: I was only trying to get <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, indeed. That was very noble of you, indeed. Now you've put
the thing on its guard. Yes, it's interesting, it's fascinating. Did
you notice that it didn't do anything until you made a noise? <br>
STEVEN: Yes, it is blind. <br>
VICKI: But it can hear. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, and very accurately. You know, I believe it can locate
us by some form of heat wave, as it were. <br>
(The Chumbley moves towards the trio. It reaches the Doctor and nudges
him gently forward.) <br>
STEVEN: Do you get that feeling that it wants us to go somewhere,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Stand still. Don't let it move you. <br>
(After a moment, the Chumbley aims it's weapon at some nearby
vegetation, and fires. The plants burst into flames.) <br>
DOCTOR: As neat a threat as ever I saw. <br>
VICKI: What was it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's some kind of light ray, very powerful and dangerous,
I would say. I think we're better do what the thing wants. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, come on Vicki. <br>
(The three travellers turn in the direction indicated, and move off
across the plain. The Chumbley follows close behind. A short way ahead,
two female figures are lying in wait behind a rocky outcrop. These are
Drahvins. They have long blonde hair and might be considered attractive
were it not for the total lack of warmth in their faces, their rigid
features showing no emotion. They wear plain high-necked green and
white uniforms, and each carries a large gun. As the Chumbley and its
prisoners draw nearer, Drahvin 2 sets down her weapon and grasps one
side of a metal mesh at her feet. Her companion takes the other side of
the mesh. As the Chumbley passes beneath them, the Drahvins hurl the
mesh down on top of it. The Chumbley's domes instantly collapse down
one on top of one another. It is immobilised.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's that? <br>
VICKI: Who are they? <br>
STEVEN: I have no idea, but aren't they a lovely surprise. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: We are the Drahvin. <br>
STEVEN: And very nice too. <br>
DOCTOR: What might the Drahvins be? <br>
DRAHVIN 1: We are from the planet Drahva, in Galaxy Four. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, well you seem to have put a pretty effective stop to this
thing. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: As long as the metal mesh covers it, the control waves
cannot reach it. <br>
VICKI: What do you want? <br>
DRAHVIN 2: We came to rescue you from the machine. <br>
STEVEN: Why? <br>
DRAHVIN 2: Maaga will tell you. <br>
STEVEN: Maaga? <br>
DRAHVIN 1: Our leader. <br>
DOCTOR: Why can't you tell us? <br>
DRAHVIN 1: Our mission was to rescue you. We have done that. We have no
other instructions except to take you to Maaga. <br>
DRAHVIN 2: We do nothing until a leader speaks. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. <br>
DRAHVIN 2: You will come now. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, I don't trust them. I don't think we should go with
them. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: If you stay here, more machines will come. They will capture
you and take you to the Rills. <br>
DOCTOR: The Rills. Are these the people that control these things? <br>
DRAHVIN 2: They are not people. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: They are things. <br>
DRAHVIN 2: They crawl. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: They murder. <br>
VICKI: Murder? <br>
DRAHVIN 2: They have already killed one of us. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I should like to meet these Rills. <br>
STEVEN: And be killed, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: It's only what they say, and who are they? <br>
STEVEN: At least they stopped the Chumbley. Doesn't that prove
something? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, all right. Well, perhaps you'd better take us to this
Maaga, this leader, whatever it is. <br>
VICKI: Doctor! More Chumblies! <br>
(Off in the distance, four more Chumblies are moving in a convoy
towards them. As the robots come closer, the Drahvins react in panic.) <br>
DRAHVIN 1: The mesh! <br>
DRAHVIN 2: It's caught! <br>
DOCTOR: They're all magnetised so that you can't get the top off. <br>
VICKI: They're getting close! <br>
DOCTOR: Goodness gracious! <br>
STEVEN: It won't come off. Let's leave it. <br>
DRAHVIN 2: We were instructed not to lose it. <br>
STEVEN: Were you instructed to be killed as well? <br>
DRAHVIN 1: We must go! <br>
DOCTOR: Come! Come! <br>
VICKI: All right, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Quickly! Quickly! <br>
(The pursuing Chumblies move in, and encircle the Chumbley trapped
beneath the metal mesh. One of them stands before it, then extends a
claw arm, grasps the mesh and pulls it away from the inert machine.
Instantly, the Chumbley comes back to life. The Chumblies set off in
pursuit of the Doctor and his party, who are heading to the Drahvin
spaceship.)

DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious! <br>
VICKI: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. It's all this physical exercise at my age. <br>
DRAHVIN 2: They're nearly here. Quickly, inside.

DRAHVIN 3: Close external door. <br>
STEVEN: Well, it was a decent space ship once. <br>
DOCTOR: It's pretty backward now, isn't it? Yes, it's almost fossilised.<br>
STEVEN: Oh I don't know, it's got one or two good features. <br>
VICKI: We only just beat those Chumblies. They're still outside. <br>
DOCTOR: Are we safe here? <br>
DRAHVIN 1: Yes. They cannot enter. <br>
DRAHVIN 2: Silence. Maaga is coming. <br>
DOCTOR: Maaga. We're back there again. <br>
MAAGA: Report. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: Mission accomplished. We have brought the prisoners. <br>
VICKI: Prisoners? <br>
MAAGA: And the metal mesh? <br>
DRAHVIN 1: It stopped the machine. <br>
MAAGA: Good. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: We could not get the mesh back. <br>
MAAGA: What? <br>
DRAHVIN 1: It became affixed to the machine. <br>
STEVEN: She's got them pretty frightened, hasn't she, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, madam, the young lady speaks the truth. The Chumblies are
magnetised. <br>
MAAGA: I will deal with you both later. Sit. I'm sorry to have kept you
waiting. Won't you sit down? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, I will. <br>
MAAGA: I have to hear the report first. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, naturally. <br>
MAAGA: It is necessary when you're at war. <br>
STEVEN: At war? <br>
MAAGA: With the Rills and their machines. <br>
VICKI: The Chumblies! <br>
MAAGA: This is a fight to the death for existence itself. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. <br>
MAAGA: in which one of us will be obliterated. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, as bad as that? <br>
MAAGA: Yes. So bad that it is conceivable that you, too, will be
obliterated. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come now, there's no need to exaggerate. <br>
MAAGA: It's no exaggeration. <br>
VICKI: You want to kill us, don't you? You want to. <br>
MAAGA: When a planet disintegrates, nothing survives. <br>
DOCTOR: Disintegrates? This planet? <br>
MAAGA: Yes, it's in its last moments of life. Soon it will explode. <br>
DOCTOR: When? <br>
MAAGA: In fourteen dawns time. <br>
STEVEN: Look, how do you know? How can you be so certain? <br>
MAAGA: The Rills told us. That is why they're repairing their
spaceship, so that they can escape. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that sounds reasonable enough to me. <br>
MAAGA: We must capture that spaceship from them. <br>
STEVEN: What for? This is a spaceship as well, isn't it? <br>
MAAGA: Yes, but it cannot fly. The Rills shot us down. We cannot move. <br>
STEVEN: You, you don't belong here? <br>
MAAGA: No. Nor do the Rills. There is no life on this planet. We come
from Drahva. Some four hundred dawns ago, we were investigating this
particular section of the galaxy. We were looking for a planet such as
this, capable of supporting life so that we might colonise it. There
are too many of us on Drahva. <br>
STEVEN: All women? <br>
MAAGA: Women? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, feminine. Ah, female. <br>
MAAGA: Oh, we have a small number of men, as many as we need. The rest
we kill. They consume valuable food and fulfill no particular function.
<br>
(Maaga indicates the two Drahvins) <br>
MAAGA: And these are not what you would call human. They are cultivated
in test tubes. We have very good scientists. I am a living being. They
are products, and inferior products. Grown for a purpose and capable of
nothing more. <br>
STEVEN: Grown for what purpose? <br>
MAAGA: To fight. To kill. <br>
DOCTOR: Yours must be a very interesting civilisation. You attacked the
Rills? <br>
MAAGA: No. We were in space above this planet when we saw a ship such
as we had never seen before. We did not know it, but it was a Rill
ship. It fired on us, and we crashed. But before we did, we managed to
fire back so that they'd crash, too. On landing they killed one of my
soldiers. <br>
STEVEN: What are they like, these Rills? <br>
MAAGA: Disgusting! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's no description, no description at all. <br>
MAAGA: That's all I'll say. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I'm beginning to understand. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, so am I, Doctor. This planet's about to explode, the Rills
have managed to repair their ship in time so they can escape. You
haven't, so you want their ship. <br>
MAAGA: We have no desire to be here when this planet ceases to exist. <br>
DRAHVIN 3: Machine approaching! <br>
(The Chumbley outside is moving rapidly towards the Drahvin spaceship.)
<br>
MAAGA: To your stations. Switch off the outside radio. <br>
VICKI: What are they doing now? <br>
STEVEN: They're going to have another go at the Chumblies, by the look
of things. <br>
DOCTOR: Switch off the outside radio? Why, I wonder? <br>
MAAGA: They send the machines to tell us lies. We do not wish to hear
them. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, madam! You may not but I'd like to hear it. <br>
MAAGA: It's not good for my soldiers. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. It's stopped. <br>
MAAGA: Yes. Now it is sending its message. Fire! <br>
(The Chumbley is hit by a burst of flame. It collapses its domes and is
still. After a moment, it raises them again, signals, turns and
chumbles off.) <br>
DOCTOR: You didn't do it very much damage, did you? <br>
MAAGA: My only intention was to scare it off. We've succeeded. To your
places. <br>
DOCTOR: And you haven't destroyed one Chumbley yet. <br>
MAAGA: We will. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I think you rather underestimate the Rills. Why
should they tell you that this planet is going to die? <br>
MAAGA: They were trying to tempt us on board their spaceship so that
they may kill us. <br>
STEVEN: You know, it seems to me as if they offered you help. <br>
MAAGA: That is what they maintain. <br>
VICKI: They might have been speaking the truth. They might have meant
it. <br>
DOCTOR: On the other hand, it might have been a pack of lies. <br>
MAAGA: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Well this planet could last another million years. <br>
MAAGA: Yes, but we have no way of proving. <br>
DOCTOR: I have. I'm a scientist. <br>
MAAGA: Very well. I should be grateful if you would find out. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, thank you. Well, I'm afraid we shall have to go
back to my ship. <br>
MAAGA: Oh, wait! You cannot all go. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but why? <br>
VICKI: Prisoners, are we? <br>
MAAGA: Of course not. But if you should encounter the machines <br>
STEVEN: What of it? <br>
MAAGA: I could not guarantee to rescue you again. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you worry too much! <br>
MAAGA: I shall feel easier if one of you remain behind. <br>
VICKI: I'll stay. <br>
DOCTOR: But my dear! <br>
VICKI: I'll stay. You'll need Steven anyway if you bump into the
Chumblies again. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, very well. Young man, you and I will go. <br>
DRAHVIN: Door opening! <br>
STEVEN: We won't be long, Vicki. I promise we won't get lost.

Tardis, but discover to their horror that they've been
beaten to it.) <br>
STEVEN: Chumblies! <br>
(Crouching down, they observe a Chumbley trying to gain entry to the
Tardis. A second
Chumbley joins it, holding some kind of drill.) <br>
STEVEN: Can they get in Doctor? <br>

barrier. <br>

living quarters. She's troubled, unable to quell the nagging suspicion
that Maaga is hiding something. Hearing raised voices in the next
compartment, Vicki crosses to the bulkhead and presses her ear against
it.&nbsp;<br>
MAAGA: To lose the mesh was gross incompetence. It was our only weapon
against the machines. If we lose to the Rills it will be because of
you. You want that, do you? <br>
DRAHVINS: (groans, groans) <br>
MAAGA: You want to be captured by those creeping, revolting, green
monsters? You want their slimy claws to close about your necks? <br>

doors. The ray has no effect. Backing off, the machines transmit a
brief message then chumble away. As soon as they've gone, Steven and
the Doctor emerge from their hiding place.) <br>
DOCTOR: There, you see, my boy? Look. Not a scratch. Not a scratch.<br>
STEVEN: Yes, well, are we going in or not, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I certainly excelled myself with that force barrier. <br>

STEVEN: We've got to get off the planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, if the Drahvins let us go. <br>
STEVEN: We've got to make that sure they do. <br>
DOCTOR: They need our help with the Rills! Why do you think they've
held Vicki back? <br>
STEVEN: Okay, but we've got to get off here somehow! <br>
DOCTOR: It's imperative that we leave at once. <br>

tube-shaped object.) <br>

a distance of a few yards.) <br>

him, the other two must help us. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: I do not understand why they would want to help a friend. <br>
MAAGA: I know you don't. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: We would not. We would leave him here. <br>
MAAGA: Yes, we would. But I have heard of creatures like these. They
help one another. <br>
DRAHVIN 3: Why, Maaga? <br>
MAAGA: I don't know. I have heard that on occasions, they even die for
one another. <br>
DRAHVIN 3: Die? For their friends? <br>
MAAGA: There are many strange things in the universe. <br>
DRAHVIN 2: I do not understand. <br>
MAAGA: I know you don't. But despite that, you will obey orders. It may
be that we shall kill neither the Rills nor the Earth creatures. Not
with our own hands, that is. It may be better for us to escape in the
Rills' spaceship and leave them here. And then, when we are out in
space, we can look back. We will see a vast, white, exploding planet
and know that they have died with it. <br>
DRAHVIN 1: But we will not see them die. <br>
MAAGA: You will not. But I, at least, have enough intelligence to
imagine it. The fear, the horror, the shuddering of a planet in its
last moments of life. And then they die. But that is for later.
Attention! <br>
(Maaga turns to address each of her soldiers in turn.) You will rest.
You will guard the prisoner. You will go out and look for the Earth
creatures. Open the door. <br>
(As the others leave the room, Drahvin 1 crosses over to sit next to
Steven, where Maaga joins her.) <br>
DRAHVIN 1: He sleeps. <br>

the chamber. One of the Chumblies gently nudges against Vicki.) <br>

CHUMBLEY: (fast, then slowing down) What do you want anyway? What do
you want anyway? What do you want anyway? What do you want anyway? What

it was necessary. <br>
(The shutter on the window has lifted.) <br>
VICKI: Who are you? <br>
CHUMBLEY: Who are you? <br>
VICKI: We're, er, we're time travellers from the planet Earth. <br>
CHUMBLEY: I see. You were sent here by the Drahvins? <br>
VICKI: Yes. <br>
CHUMBLEY: To do us harm? <br>
VICKI: No. No, you see the Drahvins are keeping a friend of ours
prisoner. So, we had to do as they said. <br>
CHUMBLEY: What was that? <br>
VICKI: To capture your spaceship. <br>
CHUMBLEY: Why do they want to capture it? We have offered to take them
with us. <br>
VICKI: They didn't tell us that. <br>
CHUMBLEY: No. They would not. They would rather kill. They hate us. <br>
VICKI: Well, you did kill one of them. <br>
CHUMBLEY: We kill no one. <br>
VICKI: But they. Look, who is talking? Is it, is it this Chumbley, or
is it someone else? <br>
CHUMBLEY: You call the machines Chumblies? <br>
VICKI: Yes. <br>
CHUMBLEY: The Chumblies have a speaker in them. They are transmitting
our thoughts. <br>
VICKI: Your, your thoughts. <br>
CHUMBLEY: We do not speak like you. We have no vocal chords. We
communicate in thought. <br>
VICKI: Who are you? <br>
CHUMBLEY: We are the Rills. <br>
VICKI: Why can't I see you? <br>
CHUMBLEY: It is better that you do not. Not all the dominant species in
the universe look like humans. Our appearance might shock you as it
shocked the Drahvins. <br>
(Outside, the Doctor has removed one of the access plates from the air
convertor, and he peers inside.)&nbsp;<br>
VICKI: The Drahvins said that you attacked them. <br>
CHUMBLEY: That is short of the truth. We were investigating outer space
when we encountered a strange ship. Rills do not attack or kill without
good reason, so we stopped our ship. Their ship also stopped. We hung
in space facing each other. We could have turned and gone away, but we
were afraid that we would be attacked. <br>
VICKI: Yes. Well, what happened? <br>
CHUMBLEY: For four dawns we hung there. Then we decided to turn. As we
were doing so the Drahvins fired. Immediately we did the same, and both
ships crashed. When we escaped from our ship we discovered that we
could not breathe the atmosphere here, but we had a small supply of our
own, and set out to help the Drahvins. <br>
(Through some form of mental projection, Vicki is now able to see past
events unfold before her eyes.) <br>
CHUMBLEY: The first one we found was badly injured. We started to help
the soldier. Then Maaga, their leader, appeared. She started to shoot
at us, so we left. We could have fought back. Our weapons are superior
to theirs. But, we do not kill. The Drahvins do. When we looked back,
we saw Maaga kill the injured soldier. <br>
VICKI: But all the Drahvins believe that you did that. <br>
CHUMBLEY: We know. That is why they keep attacking us. <br>
VICKI: Would you really have taken those people off with you? <br>
CHUMBLEY: Why not? What do we gain if they die? We will help you rescue
your friend. Something is worrying you. <br>
VICKI: Yes, I, I wish I could see the whole of you. <br>
CHUMBLEY: It is better that you don't. Besides, we cannot come out. In
order to live we must have ammoniac gas. So we live in here in a
compartment where it is filtered in. <br>
VICKI: You mean you can't breathe oxygen at all? <br>
CHUMBLEY: No. Our home planet. What is it? <br>
VICKI: You must let me out quickly, or you'll all be killed! <br>
CHUMBLEY: Killed? By whom? <br>
VICKI: By the Doctor. He's trying to wreck your machine for making
ammoniac gas. <br>

that his Drahvin guard will eventually go to sleep herself. Cautiously
opening his eyes a fraction, he sees that at last she's nodding off in
the chair. Taking great care not to make any sound that might wake the
guard, Steven sits up very slowly. Gingerly he lowers his feet to the
floor, freezing as the material beneath him creaks alarmingly. The
Drahvin jerks and mumbles, but does not wake up. Only once he's sure
that the guard is still asleep does Steven dare to move again. At last
he's sitting directly in front of the Drahvin. He raises his hands, one
aimed at her gun, the other at her mouth. Lunging forward, Steven
quietly knocks the chair backwards and snatches for the gun. He turns
it on the Drahvin, but there's no need. Examining her, he discovers she
was knocked unconscious as she fell. All is quiet. Steven straightens
and moves quickly to the door controls. Very gently, he depresses the
lever. At that moment Maaga appears, gun in hand.) <br>
MAAGA: He's trying to escape! <br>

find some in the ground. <br>

Drahvin ship, they said they intended to leave this planet in yours. <br>
CHUMBLEY: We are prepared to take them with us. <br>
STEVEN: Well, that's not what they mean. They take your ship, you stay
here. <br>
CHUMBLEY: We must hope they do not succeed. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, well, there's so little time left, they're going to be
desperate. I'll tell you what. Why not let me fix the cable for you at
this end? <br>
CHUMBLEY: Thank you! The machine will help you. It will be quicker. <br>
STEVEN: It's got to be.

VICKI: It's strange. To think that at dawn all this will explode into
nothing. <br>

out like molten silver against the other stars in the same galaxy. Yes,
well, let's have the cable, please.

MAAGA: Yes, when we have destroyed the machine we will escape. <br>

MAAGA: It's first warning of the explosion. We have only five hours

of range, not us. The moment I start my motors, we shall be out of

CHUMBLEY: Very well. In a moment we shall leave here and enter the
ship. From that time we will not be able to talk with you. The Chumbley

obey your commands. Once you have gone he will destroy himself. <br>

you. Though we are beings of separate planets, you from the solar
system and we from another space, our ways of thought, at times, do not
seem all that different. It has been an honour to know you and serve
you. <br>
