<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Gallifrey is in ruins. Only the Citadel stands
inside its protective dome. The man we saw as the Narrator in part one
strides across a bridge followed by two acolytes and takes his seat at
the head of a table. Six time lords sit, three on each side, whilst a
woman is at the far end, scribbling on parchments. The rest of the
space is in darkness.) <br>
RASSILON: What news of the Doctor? <br>
CHANCELLOR: Disappeared, my Lord President. <br>
PARTISAN: (a woman) But we know his intention. He still possesses the
Moment, and he'll use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike. <br>
CHANCELLOR: The Visionary confirms it. <br>
(The Visionary is the woman at the end of the table. She has henna
tattoos on her
face and hands.) <br>
VISIONARY: Ending, burning, falling. All of it falling. The black and
pitch and screaming fire, so burning. <br>
CHANCELLOR: All of her prophecies say the same. That this is the last
day of the Time War. That Gallifrey falls. That we die, today. <br>
VISIONARY: Ending. Ending. Ending. Ending! <br>
PARTISAN: Perhaps it's time. This is only the furthest edge of the Time
War. But at its heart, millions die every second, lost in bloodlust and
insanity. With time itself resurrecting them, to find new ways of dying
over and over again. A travesty of life. Isn't it better to end it, at
last? <br>
RASSILON: Thank you for your opinion. <br>
(The Lord President stands and aims his blue metal gauntlet at the
Partisan. Energy strikes her, she screams and is atomised.) <br>
RASSILON: I will not die! Do you hear me? A billion years of Time Lord
history riding on our backs. I will not let this perish. I will not! <br>
CHANCELLOR: There is, er, there is one part of the prophecy, my Lord. <br>
(The Chancellor brings a paper to the Lord President.) <br>
CHANCELLOR: Forgive me, I'm sorry. It's rather difficult to decipher,
but it talks of two survivors beyond the Final Day. Two children of
Gallifrey. <br>
RASSILON: Does it name them? <br>
CHANCELLOR: It foresees them locked in their final confrontation, The
Enmity of Ages, which would suggest <br>
RASSILON: The Doctor! And the Master. <br>
CHANCELLOR: One word keeps being repeated, my Lord. One constant word.
Earth. <br>
VISIONARY: Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth. Earth. <br>
CHANCELLOR: Planet Earth. Indigenous species, the human race. <br>
(A projection of the planet appears above the table.) <br>
VISIONARY: Earth. Earth. Earth. <br>
RASSILON: Maybe that's where the answer lies. Our salvation. On Earth.

MASTER: Tell me, where's your Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: You could be so wonderful. <br>
MASTER: Where is it? <br>
DOCTOR: You're a genius. You're stone cold brilliant, you are. I swear,
you really are. But you could be so much more. You could be beautiful.
With a mind like that, we could travel the stars. It would be my
honour. Because you don't need to own the universe, just see it. To
have the privilege of seeing the whole of time and space. That's
ownership enough. <br>
MASTER: Would it stop, then? The noise in my head? <br>
DOCTOR: I can help. <br>
MASTER: I don't know what I'd be without that noise. <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder what I'd be, without you. <br>
MASTER: Yeah. <br>
WILF: What does he mean? What noise? <br>
MASTER: It began on Gallifrey, as children. Not that you'd call it
childhood. More a life of duty. Eight years old. I was taken for
initiation, to stare into the Untempered Schism. <br>
WILF: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a gap in the fabric of reality. You can see into the Time
Vortex itself. And it hurts. <br>
MASTER: They took me there in the dark. I looked into time, old man,
and I heard it calling to me. Drums. The never ending drums. </font></p>

began. <br>

stayed with him for the rest of his life. <br>
RASSILON: A drumbeat. A warrior's march. <br>
CHANCELLOR: A symptom of insanity, my Lord. <br>
(The Visionary taps the rhythm for them with her long fingernail on the
metal surface of the table.) <br>
RASSILON: A rhythm of four. The heartbeat of a Time Lord.

MASTER: Except. Oh. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, yes. Oh, that's good. <br>
DOCTOR: What? What is? <br>
MASTER: The noise exists within my head, and now within six billion
heads. Everyone on Earth can hear it. Imagine. Oh. Oh, yes. <br>
(The Master's skeleton becomes briefly visible again.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Gate wasn't enough. You're still dying. <br>
MASTER: This body was born out of death. All it can do is die. But what
did you say to me, back in the wasteland? You said the end of time. <br>
DOCTOR: I said something is returning. I was shown a prophecy. That's
why I need your help. <br>
MASTER: What if I'm part of it? Don't you see? The drumbeat is calling
from so far away. From the end of time itself. And now it's been
amplified six billion times. Triangulate all those signals. I could
find its source. Oh, Doctor. That's what your prophecy was. Me! <br>
(He slaps the Doctor.) <br>
MASTER: Where's the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Just stop. Just think. <br>
MASTER: (to guard) Kill him. <br>
(A helmeted guard goes over to Wilf.) <br>
MASTER: I need that technology, Doctor. Tell me where it is, or the old
man is dead. <br>
WILF: Don't tell him. <br>
MASTER: I'll kill him right now! <br>
DOCTOR: Actually, the most impressive thing about you is that after all
this time, you're still bone dead stupid. <br>
MASTER: Take aim. <br>
DOCTOR: You've got six billion pairs of eyes, but you still can't see
the obvious, can you? <br>
MASTER: Like what? <br>
DOCTOR: That guard is one inch too tall. <br>
(The guard knocks out the Master with his rifle butt, then removes his
helmet to reveal a green spiky head.) <br>

SHAUN: It's no good. She's freezing. How long was she lying there? It's
like hypothermia. Try them again. <br>
SYLVIA: I did, it's engaged. Everyone's dialling 999. I can't get

SHAUN: We've got to do something. Wake her up. Donna? Can you hear me?
Donna? <br>
(Sylvia hears the sound of the Tardis materialising outside. Donna
opens her eyes.) <br>
SHAUN: Donna? It's me. I'm here. You're safe. You're home. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, she's smiling. As if today wasn't bad enough. Anyway, don't
go thinking this is goodbye, Wilf. I'll see you again, one more time. <br>
WILF: What do you mean? When's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Just keep looking. I'll be there. <br>
WILF: Where are you going? <br>

explosions.) <br>
MICKEY: I told you to stay behind. <br>
MARTHA: Well, you looked like you needed help. Besides, you're the one
who persuaded me to go freelance. <br>
MICKEY: Yeah, but we're being fired at by a Sontaran. A dumpling with a
gun. And this is no place for a married woman. <br>
MARTHA: Well then, You shouldn't have married me. <br>
(A Sontaran - Commander Jask, apparently - is on a catwalk behind them
with a clear shot, when the Doctor hits him on the probic vent with a
hammer. ) <br>
MICKEY: If we go in here and down to the factory floor, and down past
that corridor, then he won't know that we're here. <br>
MARTHA: Mickey. <br>

know what happened. She got Mister Smith to put out this story saying
that
Wi-Fi went mad all across the world, giving everyone hallucinations. I
mean, how else do you explain it? Everyone with a different face <br>

from being run down.) <br>
LUKE: But it's you! You're <br>

BARMAN: From the man over there. <br>

SINGER: And an apple of love fell off my apple cart. You looked at me,
my heart began to pound. You weren't the sort of guy I thought would
stick around. <br>

uniform sits next to Jack.) <br>

of it's true. I found my great grandmother's diary in the loft, and she
was a nurse in 1913, and she fell in love with this man called John
Smith. Except he was a visitor from another world. She fell in love
with a man from the stars. And she wrote it all down. <br>

WILF: And here you are, eh? Same old face. Didn't I tell you you'd be
all right? Oh! They've arrested Mister Naismith. It was on the news.
Crimes undisclosed. And his daughter. Both of them, locked up. But I
keep thinking, Doctor, there's one thing you never told me. That woman.
Who was she? <br>
DOCTOR: I just wanted to give you this. Wedding present. Thing is, I
never carry money, so I just popped back in time, borrowed a quid off a
really lovely man. Geoffrey Noble, his name was. Have it, he said. Have
that on me. <br>
