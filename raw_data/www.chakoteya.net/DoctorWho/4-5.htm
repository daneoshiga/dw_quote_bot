Tardis. The doors close and the dematerialisation sequence starts.) <br>
JAMIE: What's this? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll find out. <br>
JAMIE: Ah, I don't think I want to. <br>
BEN: It's a machine, my old haggis, which will take us away from
Scotland forever. <br>
JAMIE: Where to? <br>
BEN: Ah, well, that as the Doctor would say, that is in the lap of the
gods. We never know. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, you'd not be leading me on now, would you? Is it a fact you
don't know where we're going? <br>
POLLY: Quite true, and what's more we don't even know what year it will
be either. <br>
JAMIE: Ach now, I don't believe it. <br>
DOCTOR: Nae man can tether time nor tide. Robert Burns.<br>
(From <a href="http://www.robertburns.org.uk/Assets/Poems_Songs/tamoshanter.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Tam
O'Shanter</a>.) <br>
JAMIE: Ay? Who's Robert Burns? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I should have remembered. <br>
POLLY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well to Jamie, its 1746. Robert Burns wasn't born until 1759. <br>
BEN: Gets sort of complicated, don't it? <br>
JAMIE: What's happening now? <br>
BEN: We're just beginning to land. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold tight, everyone. <br>
JAMIE: Land? <br>
POLLY: Don't be scared, Jamie, it's all right really. <br>
BEN: I get a sort of queer feeling. See we never know what we're going
to find, do we? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the fun. Stand by, here we go. <br>
POLLY: Please let it be Chelsea 1966. <br>
BEN: Hope it's the Daleks, I don't think. <br>
DOCTOR: Prehistoric monsters. <br>
JAMIE: What have I come upon? <br>
(The Tardis materialises.) <br>
JAMIE: That wasn't too bad. Let's go outside, Doctor. <br>
BEN: Yeah, come on, Jamie, you and me first. Well, you never know, you
know. <br>
JAMIE: What? <br>
BEN: We don't know what's going to be waiting for us out there, do we?
Come on, Doctor, open up. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why not. It looks all right to me. (The doors
open.) Wait! <br>

DOCTOR: For me. </font></p>

POLLY: This time I'll guess where we are. <br>
DOCTOR: All right then, where are we? <br>
POLLY: Cornwall. <br>
BEN: Ah, you said that last time. <br>
POLLY: And I was right. <br>
JAMIE: The Isles, maybe. <br>
BEN: Don't you know? <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't a clue. Not the isles of Britain, anyway. <br>
POLLY: How can you tell? <br>
DOCTOR: This rock. It's volcanic. It's not very old either. <br>
BEN: How old? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, miocene. <br>
BEN + POLLY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: It's only about 25 million years old. Look. <br>
(Inland, a mountainous peak rises high above them.) <br>
BEN: Hey, that's an extinct volcano, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly, possibly. <br>
JAMIE: Are we not going for a wee look round? <br>
POLLY: Yes, lets. Come on. <br>
(Polly, Ben and Jamie head off up the side of the volcano.) <br>
POLLY: Oh, give us a hand. <br>
BEN: Here. <br>
(The higher they go, the steeper the slope. On the beach, the Doctor
takes out his pocket watch and checks the time against the position of
the sun)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The group stop for a rest half way up.) <br>
BEN: I don't reckon we're going to see much when we get there. <br>
POLLY: Ben? <br>
BEN: What now? <br>
POLLY: I'm beginning to see things. <br>
BEN: Where? <br>
POLLY: Down there, look. I'm sure I saw something moving. <br>
BEN: Ah, you're round the twist. <br>
POLLY: Look, there it is again. <br>
BEN: You see anything? <br>
JAMIE: Nothing. <br>
POLLY: Ben, I think we ought to go back. <br>
BEN: No, not me, I'm having a dekko down here. <br>
JAMIE: Yeah, me too. <br>
POLLY: Wait for me! <br>
(Polly struggles after the men. They stop again just below the summit.)
POLLY: Oh, can't we stop and have a breather? <br>
JAMIE: Ben and I'll go on. You stay here. <br>
POLLY: Oh, no. <br>
BEN: We shan't be long, love, back before you know it. <br>
POLLY: All right. <br>
(Polly looks at the view. They are on the largest of a chain of
islands, some no more than large rocks. The ocean surrounds them in all
directions. The sound of falling pebbles lures Polly to a cave entrance
a short distance away. She goes inside. It is dark, but once her eyes
have acclimatised Polly sees an elaborate bracelet on the floor, with a
design of a kneeling figure holding a burning torch. She bends to pick
it up and a shadow falls over her. Polly screams.) <br>
BEN: Hey, that's Polly. <br>
(Ben and Jamie run back to where they left Polly.) <br>
BEN: Polly? Polly? <br>
(Jamie spots the cave entrance.) <br>
JAMIE: She must have gone inside. <br>
BEN: Hang on, I've got a torch.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor has finished his calculations and is
looking around carefully in the rock pools. He finds some shards of
pottery.) <br>
DOCTOR: Mediterranean. Oh no, tidal sea, can't be. That's funny, it
hasn't been fired long. <br>
(The Doctor puts the pottery into his pocket and goes to find the
others.)

(In the cave, Ben and Jamie find a tunnel leading deeper into the
mountain.) <br>
BEN: Polly, where are you? <br>
JAMIE: Polly? <br>
BEN: What's that? <br>
(A weighted net falls onto them and they are pushed into a metal cage
hanging over a pit.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cage]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POLLY: Ben, Jamie, is it you? <br>
BEN: Who do you think it is? <br>
JAMIE: Are you all right, Polly? <br>
POLLY: Yes. <br>
BEN: When you're finished get us out of this contraption. <br>
POLLY: I can't. They've tied me up. <br>
JAMIE: Who are they? <br>
POLLY: I don't know, I didn't see them. <br>
(The door opens and another person is pushed into the cage with them.) <br>
BEN: That's all we needed. <br>
DOCTOR: So they caught you too. <br>
(The cage lurches and descends. The wind whistles past them.) <br>
BEN: Left half me stomach behind. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, me too. <br>
POLLY: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: That we shall find out very soon. <br>
POLLY: Wherever it is it's an awful long way down. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we must be below sea level already. <br>
JAMIE: It's difficult to breathe. <br>
BEN: What is it, Doctor? <br>
POLLY: It's a funny taste. I don't feel very well. <br>
DOCTOR: Here we are. <br>
(The Doctor unties Polly.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't be frightened anybody. If we pass out it's
compressed nitrogen. It's called caissons disease. <br>
BEN: Polly, try and get us out of here. <br>
POLLY: I'll try. <br>
(Polly struggles with the net, but passes out. The cage reaches the
bottom of the shaft. All four are unconscious as four guards in
primitive clothes take them to a small chamber and lie them out of
padded benches to recover.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
BEN: Where's this? Polly? Jamie? <br>
JAMIE: Oh. <br>
BEN: Come on, man, rise and shine. <br>
JAMIE: Would you disturb the dead. <br>
BEN: Oh you're not dead, you just got a touch of the submariners',
that's all. <br>
JAMIE: What are they? <br>
BEN: It'd take too long to explain now. This must be some sort of
compression chamber. <br>
DOCTOR: Troglodytes. <br>
BEN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Ancient tribes from North Africa who lived in caves. Possibly,
possibly. Where's my diary? <br>
BEN: Cave men? Hey, Jamie, you better watch it. With that kilt someone
might mistake you for a bird. <br>
JAMIE: What? <br>
(Polly wakes, groaning.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's difficult to put a precise date on these people. <br>
POLLY: I don't think it is. <br>
DOCTOR: All right then, when? <br>
POLLY: Oh, I'd say about 1970. <br>
DOCTOR: Can you prove it? <br>
BEN: Yeah, go on, prove it. <br>
JAMIE: How d'you know, Polly? <br>
BEN: Ah, she's been studying her crystal ball. <br>
POLLY: Abracadabra. <br>
(Polly produces the bracelet she found.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, how interesting, yes. Hmm. It's Aztec. Fake of course. <br>
BEN: Mexico Olympiad. <br>
POLLY: When we first left Earth it hadn't happened yet. <br>
BEN: No, that's right, it wasn't due till 1968. <br>
POLLY: Right, so now is any time later than that. <br>
JAMIE: Later? Oh, I wish I understood. <br>
(The door opens. A guard carrying a trident enters.) <br>
BEN: Polly, you speak foreign. Go and talk to him. Ask him where we
are. <br>
POLLY: Er, parlez-vous francais? Sprechen Sie deutsch? Habla si
espanol? <br>
GUARD: Bazumi tampost postu! <br>
JAMIE: Au Gaelic akye? <br>
BEN: What's that? <br>
JAMIE: Gaelic. <br>
(The guards prods them to the door with his trident.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that means move in any language. I think we'd better
comply. Women and children last. Polly?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Guards line the corridor to the small room where a
table is being laid with food. The Doctor tries some.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh food. <br>
(The guard raises his weapon to hit the serving girl, so the Doctor
accidentally
gets in the way.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you. <br>
(The girl smiles and leaves hurriedly.) <br>
DOCTOR: This is good. <br>
(The guard leaves by another door.) <br>
DOCTOR: This is very good. Mmmm. It's delicious. This is excellent. Sit
down, sit down. This is ambrosia. <br>
BEN: What's got into him? <br>
POLLY: I don't know. I've never seen him go for food like this before.
It's usually hats. <br>
JAMIE: Better hurry or he'll scoff the lot. <br>
(But they don't share his enthusiasm for the cuisine.) <br>
BEN: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Plankton. <br>
JAMIE: Plankton? What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's small plants and animals from the sea. <br>
POLLY: Animals? <br>
BEN: Yeah, little spidery ones. <br>
POLLY: Oh, I don't think I'm very hungry, thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: You'd better get used to it. I don't expect there's much else
to be had around here. Visitors! <br>
(A striking figure in splendid robes sweeps into the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good day to you. <br>
(He is a priest, and is accompanied by guards.) <br>
RAMO: We've been expecting you. <br>
POLLY: He speaks English. <br>
BEN: What does he mean, he's been expecting us? We didn't know we were
coming ourselves. <br>
RAMO: The living goddess Amdo sees and hears all. <br>
DOCTOR: And she had a message about us? For you? <br>
RAMO: Yes. She told us you would fall from the sky in time for our
festival of the vernal equinox. <br>
DOCTOR: And just what part are we to play in this festival of the
vernal equinox? <br>
RAMO: A very important part, I regret to say. Guards. <br>
(There's a scuffle.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! Wait! I have something important to say. <br>
RAMO: Be quick and say it then. <br>
DOCTOR: I won't speak under threats! <br>
RAMO: You have five minutes in which to make your point. After that you
will join your companions. The ceremony will proceed. <br>
POLLY: Doctor? <br>
RAMO: Go, girl. <br>
DOCTOR: What will happen to them? <br>
RAMO: They will come to no harm. Yet. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll have to go, Polly. <br>
(The guards take Ben, Polly and Jamie away.) <br>
RAMO: Now, stranger, say what you have to and do not waste time. There
is very little of it left for any of you. <br>
DOCTOR: What I have to say concerns a certain Professor Zaroff. <br>
RAMO: What do you know of Zaroff? <br>
DOCTOR: A great deal. He's here, isn't he? <br>
RAMO: How did you know? <br>
DOCTOR: The food. It couldn't be anyone else but Zaroff. He led the
field in producing food from the sea. His progress is astonishing. <br>
RAMO: You are a friend of Zaroff's? <br>
DOCTOR: Just send him this message, and you'll see. <br>
(The Doctor takes out a pencil and paper.) <br>
RAMO: I will take no message to Zaroff. <br>
DOCTOR: You're making a big mistake! <br>
(The serving girl returns.) <br>
RAMO: Yes, what is it, Ara? <br>
ARA: I've come to clear the table. <br>

supported by carved pillars cut from the rock. There is a large idol of
the goddess, a fish-woman hybrid. Her altar is lit by burning braziers
and tended by priests. In the centre is a platform with four beams
radiating out from its centre. Polly, Ben and Jamie are dragged before
the altar.) <br>
POLLY: I'm scared. What are they going to do to us? <br>
JAMIE: I don't see the Doctor here. He's escaped, maybe. <br>
BEN: Ah, some chance of that. <br>

shark infested waters below. Ben, Polly and Jamie are laid on the beams
so their heads are together at the centre, pointing towards the well.) <br>

never know the secret I was going to tell you. <br>

controller. He will know what to do with them. Well, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: First, let me say how glad I am to see that the reports of your
death twenty years previously are a little premature. <br>
ZAROFF: The whole world believed I had been kidnapped. <br>
DOCTOR: The East blamed the West. The West, the East. <br>
ZAROFF: Oh, I wish I could have been there. <br>
DOCTOR: Now here you are, the greatest scientific genius since
Leonardo, under the sea. You must have a fantastic story to tell? <br>
ZAROFF: Perhaps I tell you someday, if you will live long enough to
hear. Now this vital secret, what is it? I must know. <br>
(The Doctor makes sure that the others have been taken away.) <br>
DOCTOR: I haven't got one. <br>

DOCTOR: We're on the ancient kingdom of Atlantis. <br>
ZAROFF: Yes, yes, and this is not the perfect place to complete my

opposition to ancient temple ritual and idol worship? <br>

simple. When Atlantis was submerged at the time of the flood, some life
continued in air pockets in the mountain's caves, thanks to the natural
air shaft provided by the extinct volcano. <br>
(The Doctor has a pair of wire-cutters behind his back.) <br>
ZAROFF: You like my laboratory, yes? You find all this very impressive,
no? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not a bit, not a bit. <br>
ZAROFF: What do you mean? <br>

ZAROFF: One operation, one girl. You are making an unnecessary fuss. <br>
DAMON: I know what's going on. You're using so much voltage on the

Ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with the civil supply. There's never
anything wrong. Look, the supply to your clinic is always adequate and
cannot be affected by demands elsewhere. <br>

DOCTOR: The dreams of a people living on a drowned continent must be. <br>
ZAROFF: To lift Atlantis from the ocean. Make it dry land again. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. But now, how are you going to do it? Even a genius

more than a hundred miles thick. Below that is believed to be a

ZAROFF: There is a place where a fissure reduces the distance to less
than fifteen miles. <br>
DOCTOR: It's still an enormous obstacle. <br>
ZAROFF: But not insurmountable. We have been working on it for many

ZAROFF: You tell me, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the water will be converted into superheated steam, the
pressure will grow, and crack the crust of the Earth. Destroy all life,
maybe even blow the planet apart. <br>
ZAROFF: Yes. And I shall have redeemed my promise to lift Atlantis from
the sea. Lift it to the sky! It will be magnificent. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ZAROFF: Bang! Bang! Bang, bang! That's all. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Just one small question. Why do you want to blow up the

RAMO: Most excellent Thous, this is a matter of life and death. Under
no other circumstances would I have brought a stranger to you in temple
garb. <br>
THOUS: A stranger? Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: A man of science. <br>
THOUS: Science? Ah, I see. One of Professor Zaroff's colleagues.
Perhaps we should ask him to join us. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, I wouldn't do that if I were you. In fact, I wanted
to speak to you alone, Excellency. <br>
(Ramo moves away.) <br>
THOUS: Well, speak. <br>
DOCTOR: Excellency, the Professor is a wonderful man. <br>
THOUS: Wonderful? <br>
DOCTOR: A worker of miracles. <br>
THOUS: Indeed, you speak the truth. <br>
DOCTOR: But, have you noticed his eyes lately? <br>
THOUS: No. <br>
DOCTOR: When he talks of his project, have you noticed his eyes? They
light up like this! <br>
THOUS: What does this mean? <br>
DOCTOR: The Professor is as mad as a hatter. <br>
THOUS: Mad? Zaroff? <br>
DOCTOR: Completely. No answer. It's sad. <br>
THOUS: I do not understand. <br>
RAMO: We believe Zaroff to be working toward the destruction of
Atlantis, not it's resurrection. <br>
THOUS: I have heard such words from you before, Ramo. <br>
RAMO: This man has proved it to me. Zaroff's plan will split the world
in two. This is not the action of a sane man. <br>
THOUS: But your own priests proclaimed him to be the prophet who would
raise us above the sea. <br>
RAMO: Lolem. He is old and superstitious. <br>
THOUS: And your superior, Ramo. Remember that! <br>
DOCTOR: So you will not listen to us? <br>
THOUS: I did not say that. I have heard your arguments. <br>
DOCTOR: We've only just begun. <br>
THOUS: I have heard enough. Now leave me, and I will consider what you
have said. <br>
RAMO: I know you will choose well, for all our sakes.

ZAROFF: I have made a mistake. If I had not interfered with the temple
sacrifice, the sharks would have torn you apart. But it's not too late.
I'll return you to Lolem and tell him I need you no longer. And he can
have that stupid priest as makeweight. <br>

raises his sword, a shrieking sound comes from the mouth of the idol.

ZAROFF: No. Disappeared, you say? How? <br>
LOLEM: They were in our midst and we bowed our heads in prayer. When we
looked again they'd gone. <br>

ZAROFF: Yes. If the Doctor is at large, he can be an even bigger

RAMO: But there's always plenty of food for everyone. The sea is all
around us. The supplies are unlimited. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but who provides it? <br>
RAMO: The fish people do. <br>
DOCTOR: The fish people! Exactly. And why? Because they are slaves. But
slaves, like worms, can be made to turn. <br>
POLLY: Right. So if you organise the fish people to cut off the
supplies. Yes, but that's no good. Then they'll just go and live off
their stocks. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell them, Ramo. <br>
RAMO: We have no stocks of food. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Zaroff has not yet found the answer to his great
