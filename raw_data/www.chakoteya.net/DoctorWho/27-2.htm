Doctor and Rose are lit in green light from the time rotor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right then, Rose Tyler, you tell me. Where do you want to go?
Backwards or forwards in time. It's your choice. What's it going to be?
<br>
ROSE: Forwards. <br>
DOCTOR: How far? <br>
ROSE: One hundred years. <br>
(A few seconds of travel.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you go. Step outside those doors, it's the twenty second
century. <br>
ROSE: You're kidding. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a bit boring, though. Do you want to go further? <br>
ROSE: Fine by me. <br>
DOCTOR: Ten thousand years in the future. Step outside, it's the year
12005, the new Roman Empire. <br>
ROSE: You think you're so impressive. <br>
DOCTOR: I am so impressive. <br>
ROSE: You wish. <br>
DOCTOR: Right then, you asked for it. I know exactly where to go. Hold
on! <br>
(The Tardis zooms down a time vortex.) <br>
ROSE: Where are we? What's out there? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Rose goes down a flight of steps and a large
shutter in the wall descends to reveal an orbital view of the Earth.) <br>
DOCTOR: You lot, you spend all your time thinking about dying, like
you're going to get killed by eggs or beef or global warming or
asteroids. But you never take time to imagine the impossible, that
maybe you survive. This is the year five point five slash apple slash
twenty six. Five billion years in your future, and this is the day <br>
(He looks at his wrist watch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on. <br>
(The sun flares and turns red.) <br>
DOCTOR: This is the day the Sun expands. Welcome to the end of the
world.

(The Doctor and Rose walk along a corridor.) <br>
ROSE: So, when it says guests, does that mean people? <br>
DOCTOR: Depends what you mean by people. <br>
ROSE: I mean people. What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Aliens. <br>
ROSE: What are they doing on board this spaceship? What's it all for? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not really a spaceship, more like an observation deck. The
great and the good are gathering to watch the planet burn. <br>
(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on a wall panel.) <br>
ROSE: What for? <br>
DOCTOR: Fun.

DOCTOR: Mind you, when I said the great and the good, what I mean is,
the rich. <br>
ROSE: But, hold on. They did this once on Newsround Extra. The sun
expanding, that takes hundreds of years. <br>
DOCTOR: Millions, but the planet's now property of the National Trust.
They've been keeping it preserved. See down there? Gravity satellites
holding back the sun. <br>
ROSE: The planet looks the same as ever. I thought the continents
shifted and things. <br>
DOCTOR: They did, and the Trust shifted them back. That's a classic
Earth. But now the money's run out, nature takes over. <br>
ROSE: How long's it got? <br>
DOCTOR: About half an hour and then the planet gets roasted. <br>
ROSE: Is that why we're here? I mean, is that what you do? Jump in at
the last minute and save the Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not saving it. Time's up. <br>
ROSE: But what about the people? <br>
DOCTOR: It's empty. They're all gone. No one left. <br>
ROSE: Just me, then. <br>
(A blue-skinned person with golden slit eyes strides towards them.) <br>
STEWARD: Who the hell are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's nice, thanks. <br>
STEWARD: But how did you get in? This is a maximum hospitality zone.
The guests have disembarked. They're on their way any second now. <br>
DOCTOR: That's me. I'm a guest. Look, I've got an invitation. Look.
There, you see? It's fine, you see? The Doctor plus one. I'm the
Doctor, this is Rose Tyler. She's my plus one. Is that all right? <br>
(The Doctor puts away the piece of apparently blank paper he was
showing to the steward.) <br>
STEWARD: Well, obviously. Apologies, et cetera. If you're on board,
we'd better start. Enjoy. <br>
(The Steward goes over to a lecturn.) <br>
DOCTOR: The paper's slightly psychic. It shows them whatever I want
them to see. Saves a lot of time. <br>
ROSE: He's blue. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
ROSE: Okay. <br>
STEWARD: We have in attendance the Doctor and Rose Tyler. Thank you.
All staff to their positions. <br>
(A lot of small people appear.) <br>
STEWARD: Hurry, now, thank you. Quick as we can. Come along, come
along. And now, might I introduce the next honoured guest? Representing
the Forest of Cheam, we have trees, namely, Jabe, Lute and Coffa. <br>
(A bark-skinned woman enters with two larger male escorts.) <br>
STEWARD: There will be an exchange of gifts representing peace. If you
could keep the room circulating, thank you. Next, from the solicitors
Jolco and Jolco, we have the Moxx of Balhoon. <br>
(Another blue alien, this time mostly head and body, sitting on a
transport pod.) <br>
STEWARD: And next, from Financial Family Seven, we have the Adherents
of the Repeated Meme. <br>
(A group of black-robed bipeds.) <br>
STEWARD: The inventors of Hypo-slip Travel Systems, the brothers Hop
Pyleen. Thank you. <br>
(Fur clad reptilians. The announcements of variations on the biped
theme continue.) <br>
STEWARD: Cal Spark Plug. Mister and Mrs Pakoo. The Ambassadors from the
City State of Binding Light. <br>
(The trees go up to the Doctor.) <br>
JABE: The Gift of Peace. I bring you a cutting of my Grandfather. <br>
(She gives the Doctor a rooted twig in a small pot.) <br>
DOCTOR Thank you. Yes, gifts. Er, I give you in return air from my
lungs. <br>
(He breathes gently on Jabe.) <br>
JABE: How intimate. <br>
DOCTOR: There's more where that came from. <br>
JABE: I bet there is. <br>
STEWARD: From the Silver Devastation, the sponsor of the main event,
please welcome the Face of Boe. <br>
(A large glass case barely makes it through the doorway. It contains a
giant humanoid head with straggly hair and squinting eyes.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Moxx of Balhoon. <br>
MOXX: My felicitations on this historical happenstance. I give you the
gift of bodily salivas. <br>
(Moxx's spit hits Rose in the face.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. <br>
(The black-robed group glide up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! The Adherents of the Repeated Meme. I bring you air from my
lungs. <br>
(A large metal hand holds out a ball.) <br>
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith. <br>
STEWARD: And last but not least, our very special guest. Ladies and
gentlemen, and trees and multiforms, consider the Earth below. In
memory of this dying world, we call forth the last Human. The Lady
Cassandra O'Brien Dot Delta Seventeen. <br>
(A face in a piece of thin skin stretched in a rectangular frame is
wheeled in by two men hidden in top-to-toe hospital whites. She is
modelled on, and voiced by, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910738/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Zoe
Wanamaker</a>.) <br>
CASSANDRA: Oh, now, don't stare. I know, I know it's shocking, isn't
it? I've had my chin completely taken away and look at the difference.
Look how thin I am. Thin and dainty. I don't look a day over two
thousand. Moisturise me. Moisturise me. <br>
(One of her attendants uses a pump spray on the skin.) <br>
CASSANDRA: Truly, I am the last Human. My father was a Texan, my mother
was from the Arctic Desert. They were born on the Earth and were the
last to be buried in its soil. I have come to honour them and say
goodbye. Oh, no tears, no tears. I'm sorry. But behold, I bring gifts.
From Earth itself, the last remaining ostrich egg. Legend says it had a
wingspan of fifty feet and blew fire from its nostrils. Or was that my
third husband? Oh, no. Oh, don't laugh. I'll get laughter lines. And
here, another rarity. <br>
(Rose has walked round the back of Cassandra to see just how thin she
is, and a 50's juke box is wheeled in.) <br>
CASSANDRA: According to the archives, this was called an iPod. It
stores classical music from humanity's greatest composers. Play on! <br>
(One of the little attendants presses a button, a 45 is selected and
the strains of Tainted Love by Soft Cell ring out.) <br>
STEWARD: Refreshments will now be served. Earth Death in thirty
minutes. <br>
(Rose finally can't take all the aliens, and runs out. The Doctor goes
to follow her, but gets intercepted.) <br>
JABE: Doctor? <br>
(Flash! from a device she is holding. A type of camera, presumably.) <br>
JABE: Thank you. <br>
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith. <br>
STEWARD: No, you're very kind, but I'm just the Steward. <br>
ADHERENT: A gift of peace in all good faith. <br>
STEWARD: Well, yes, thank you. Of course. <br>
(The steward takes the proffered ball. Jabe consults her camera, which
twitters like a bird.) <br>
JABE: Identify species. Please identify species. Now stop it. Identify
his race. Where's he from? It's impossible. <br>
(She hurries away. One of the Adherant's gifts has been placed on a
shelf in a display stand. It opens, and a four-legged metal spider
scurries away.)

growing Sun through a window when a young woman of the same race as the
Steward comes round the corner. She is wearing overalls and a baseball
cap.) <br>
ROSE: Sorry. Am I allowed to be in here? <br>
RAFFALO: You have to give us permission to talk. <br>
ROSE: Er, you have permission. <br>
RAFFALO: Thank you. And, no, you're not in the way. Guests are allowed
anywhere. <br>
ROSE: Okay. <br>
(Raffalo goes to a wall panel and unlocks it.) <br>
ROSE: What's your name? <br>
RAFFALO: Raffalo. <br>
ROSE: Raffalo? <br>
RAFFALO: Yes, miss. I won't be long, I've just got to carry out some
maintenance. There's a tiny little glitch in the Face of Boe's suite.
There must be something blocking the system. He's not getting any hot
water. <br>
ROSE: So, you're a plumber? <br>
RAFFALO: That's right, miss. <br>
ROSE: They still have plumbers? <br>
RAFFALO: I hope so, else I'm out of a job. <br>
ROSE: Where are you from? <br>
RAFFALO: Crespallion. <br>
ROSE: That's a planet, is it? <br>
RAFFALO: No. Crespallion's part of the Jaggit Brocade, affiliated to
the Scarlet Junction, Convex fifty six. And where are you from, miss?
If you don't mind me asking. <br>
ROSE: No, not at all. Er, I don't know. A long way away. I just sort of
hitched a lift with this man. I didn't even think about it. I don't
even know who he is. He's a complete stranger. Anyway, don't let me
keep you. Good luck with it. <br>
RAFFALO: Thank you, miss. And er, thank you for the permission. Not
many people are that considerate. <br>
ROSE: Okay. See you later. <br>
(Rose leaves. Raffalo removes the wall panel and has a look inside.) <br>
RAFFALO: Now then. Control, I'm at junction nineteen and I think the
problem's coming from in here. I'll go inside and have a look. <br>
(Before she can crawil into the conduit, there is a tapping sound of
metal on metal.) <br>
RAFFALO: What's that? Is something in there? <br>
(A metal spider comes towards her.) <br>
RAFFALO: Oh! Who are you, then? <br>
(It scuttles away.) <br>
RAFFALO: Hold on! I if you're an upgrade I just need to register you,
that's all. Oh, come back. <br>
(She gets inside the conduit.) <br>
RAFFALO: Ah, there you are. Now, I just need to register your ident.
Oh, there's two of you. Got yourself a little mate. I think I'd better
report this to Control. How many of you are there? What are you? Oh,
no, no, no! <br>
(Raffalo gets dragged along the conduit.)

CASSANDRA: Seven hundred and eight. Next week, it's seven hundred and
nine. I'm having my blood bleached. Is that why you wanted a word? You
could be flatter, Rose. You've got a little bit of a chin poking out. <br>
ROSE: I'd rather die. <br>
CASSANDRA: Honestly, it doesn't hurt. <br>
ROSE: No, I mean it. I would rather die. It's better to die than live
like you, a bitchy trampoline. <br>
CASSANDRA: Oh, well. What do you know. <br>
ROSE: I was born on that planet, and so was my mum, and so was my dad,
and that makes me officially the last human being in this room, 'cos
you're not human. You've had it all nipped and tucked and flattened
till there's nothing left. Anything human got chucked in the bin.
You're just skin, Cassandra. Lipstick and skin. Nice talking. <br>

doing in a place like this? <br>
JABE: Respect for the Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Everyone on this platform's worth zillions. <br>
JABE: Well, perhaps it's a case of having to be seen at the right
occasions. <br>
DOCTOR: In case your share prices drop? I know you lot. You've got
massive forests everywhere, roots everywhere, and there's always money
in land. <br>
JABE: All the same, we respect the Earth as family. So many species
evolved from that planet. Mankind is only one. I'm another. My
ancestors were transplanted from the planet down below, and I'm a
direct descendant of the tropical rainforest. <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. <br>
(He scans a door panel marked Welcome to Platform One. Guide of
Platform One Do You Need Assistance. A keypad labelled
Maintenance log in, then Access denied.) <br>
JABE: And what about your ancestry, Doctor? Perhaps you could tell a
story or two. Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when there's nothing
else left. I scanned you earlier. The metal machine had trouble
identifying your species. It refused to admit your existence. And even
when it named you, I wouldn't believe it. But it was right. I know
where you're from. Forgive me for intruding, but it's remarkable that
you even exist. I just wanted to say how sorry I am. <br>

pistol whipping her with a weapon. They drag her into a room.) <br>
