CHUB: There was a Voc therapist in Kaldor City, specially programmed,
equipped with vibro-digits, subcutaneous stimulators, the lot. You know
what happened, Borg? <br>
(He goes over to a man getting a massage from a robot, V16.) <br>
CHUB: Its first client wanted treatment for a stiff elbow. The Voc
therapist felt carefully all round the joint and then suddenly just
twisted his arm off at the shoulder. Shumf! All over in two seconds. <br>
BORG: I've never heard that.&nbsp;<br>

CHUB: Kaldor City. <br>
DASK: What was the reason? <br>
CHUB: Reason? It was haywire. I wouldn't let a robot work on me, not
for the zelanite in this ship. <br>
BORG: Shut up, Chub. Thank you, V16. <br>
DASK: A Voc class robot has over a million multi-level constrainers in
its circuitry. All of them would have to malfunction before it could
perform such an action. <br>
TOOS: That's your trouble, Dask. You take all the magic out of life. <br>

the Doctor's yo-yo, and doing it quite well.) <br>
LEELA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
LEELA: Can I stop now? <br>
DOCTOR: If you want to. <br>
LEELA: It will not affect this? <br>
DOCTOR: Affect this? No, it's a yo-yo. It's a game. I thought you were
enjoying it. <br>
(Leela drops the yo-yo.) <br>
LEELA: Enjoying it? You said I had to keep it going up and down. I
thought it was part of the magic. <br>
DOCTOR: Magic, Leela? Magic? <br>
LEELA: I know, I know. There's no such thing as magic. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. To the rational mind nothing is inexplicable, only
unexplained. <br>
LEELA: So, explain to me how this Tardis is larger on the inside than
the out. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? All right, I'll show you. It's because insides and
outsides are not in the same dimension. <br>
(The Doctor gets two boxes from a cupboard.) <br>
DOCTOR: Which box is larger? <br>
LEELA: That one. <br>
(The Doctor places it on the time console then goes over to Leela with
the other.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now which one is larger? <br>
LEELA: That one. <br>
DOCTOR: But it looks smaller. <br>
LEELA: Well, that's because it's further away. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. If you could keep that exactly that distance away and
have it here, the large one would fit inside the small one. <br>
LEELA: That's silly. <br>
DOCTOR: That's transdimensional engineering, a key Time Lord discovery.
<br>
(The Tardis materialises.) <br>
DOCTOR: This is the exciting bit. <br>
LEELA: What's exciting? <br>
DOCTOR: Seeing what's outside. <br>
(The scanner shows that what's outside are metal walls and a sandy
floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: I don't. It's metal. We've landed inside something metal. <br>
LEELA: But how can we? How can the Tardis be inside something metal? <br>
DOCTOR: One box inside another. I just explained it to you. <br>
LEELA: No, not very clearly. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a rather dull subject anyway. I wonder where we are?
<br>
LEELA: You mean you don't know? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, not precisely, no. <br>
LEELA: You mean you can't control this machine? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course I can control it. Nine times out of ten. Well,
seven times out of ten. Five times. Look. Never mind, let's see where
you are. <br>
(Leela picks up the Tesh weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: You won't need that. <br>
LEELA: How do you know? <br>
DOCTOR: I never carry weapons. If people see you mean them no harm,
they never hurt you. Nine times out of ten. <br>

TOOS: In a moment. <br>
UVANOV: Right tracking? <br>
ZILDA: Clear and running, Commander. <br>
UVANOV: Left tracking? <br>
ZILDA: And running. <br>
TOOS: It's small. Scale three point four, not building. <br>
UVANOV: What have you done with all the big ones? <br>

UVANOV: Chub. Get after him. <br>
POUL: It's all right, I'll go. <br>
UVANOV: Scientists. How can I run a mine with amateurs. <br>
ZILDA: Chub's all right. <br>
UVANOV: Why? Because he's from one of the founding families? <br>
ZILDA: I didn't mention his family. <br>
UVANOV: One of the Twenty? You know, it's amazing the way you people
stick together. No, it's not amazing, it's sickening. <br>
ZILDA: I hope you're watching the traverses, Commander. <br>
UVANOV: Please, don't worry about my job, Zilda. What's she blowing,
Toos? <br>
TOOS: The spectrum is muddy. Could be some zelanite, some keefan,
traces of lucanol! <br>
UVANOV: Ah, money in the bank. Cheer up, Zilda. I'll make you rich
again. </font></p>

V45: Yes, sir? <br>
CHUB: Where have you been? Get that instrument package. Well, come on,
get a move on. I've got to launch it before the hatches are locked. <br>
(The robot's eyes are glowing red.) <br>
CHUB: Did you hear what I said? <br>
V45: Yes, sir. I heard what you said. <br>

UVANOV: All right then, first things first. There's nothing we can do
for him now. <br>
POUL: He was murdered! <br>

of it. <br>
LEELA: It's beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. A bit garish for my taste. <br>
LEELA: What's that white thing on the horizon? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Looks like dust. It's a sandstorm. Come on, let's get out
of here. Come on! This is a sandminer. We're in one of the scoops. <br>
LEELA: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: The storm could be travelling at a thousand miles an hour. The
sand will cut us to pieces unless we get back to the Tardis. Come on! <br>
(The storm front arrives as they return to the hopper where the Tardis
landed.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've been robbed! <br>
LEELA: I said I heard something. <br>

while. <br>
UVANOV: Right, we'll make a start, then. <br>
DASK: Right. <br>
UVANOV: Now, you all know that Chub is dead. One of you killed him. <br>
ZILDA: One of us, surely. <br>
UVANOV: That's what I said. <br>
POUL: You did say one of you. <br>
UVANOV: All right then, one of us killed him. The question is, which
one? <br>
TOOS: And why? <br>
UVANOV: Well, this is a two year tour. Maybe Chub was just beginning to
get on somebody's nerves. <br>
BORG: Me? <br>
ZILDA: He was certainly getting on yours. <br>
UVANOV: Yes, but we all know where I was. <br>
BORG: I was on the power deck. <br>
UVANOV: Was Dask with you? <br>
BORG: Yes. <br>
DASK: Not all the time. I went to check the syncro-relays. <br>
BORG: Now look, I had nothing against Chub. Okay, he talked too much
but <br>
ZILDA: Anyway, the time Poul heard the scream. <br>
CASS: Ah, ah, says he heard the scream. Let's keep the point open. <br>
POUL: Why should I lie? <br>
UVANOV: Now you interrupted Zilda. Founding Family people never
interrupt each other. Isn't that right, Zilda? <br>
POUL: Someone interrupted Chub with both hands. <br>
UVANOV: Please, Poul. We're all waiting for Zilda. <br>
ZILDA: I was simply going to say the scream could have been arranged. <br>
TOOS: How? <br>
ZILDA: A communicator recording. <br>
UVANOV: What would be the point? <br>
ZILDA: To give somebody an alibi, Commander. You sent Poul to look for
Chub. You could have arranged it all. <br>
TOOS: You mean the poor man might have been dead when Poul heard the
scream? <br>
UVANOV: Nice try, Zilda. Now, does anybody know what this is? <br>
(The red marker.) <br>
DASK: It's a corpse marker. <br>
UVANOV: What? <br>
DASK: Robot deactivation disc. They use them in the construction
centres. If ever we used the stop circuit and turned off all our
robots, they'd have to go back to a construction centre for
reactivation. On arrival, each would be marked with a disc like that to
show it was a deactivated robot. The technicians call them corpse
markers. It's a sort of a joke. <br>
POUL: It seems our murderer has a sense of humour. <br>
UVANOV: That was on the back of Chub's hand. <br>
BORG: Not just a murderer, then. Seems like one one of us is a maniac. <br>
CASS: Use your brain, Borg. We would know, wouldn't we? <br>
BORG: But we don't. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. I have seen a similar sort of thing on Korlano Beta. The
mine passes over the surface searching for useful ores. Naturally, the
heavier elements tend to sink into the substratas, so a really good
sandstorm is a bonus. It stirs things up a bit. <br>
LEELA: Sometimes you talk like a Tesh. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
LEELA: It was not well meant. Are the mechanical men friendly? <br>
DOCTOR: Robots don't have feelings. It's the people they serve we must
hope are friendly. <br>

time. <br>

then the Doctor.) </font></p>

killed three people. Can you think of any good reason why I should not
have you executed on the spot? <br>
LEELA: No, but you can, otherwise you'd have done it. <br>

UVANOV: Where is this man? <br>
POUL: They're taking him to the crew room now. <br>

POUL: Why do you use these? Robot deactivation discs. There was one on
Kerril, too. <br>
UVANOV: You fool! What did you have to tell her that for? <br>
POUL: I assumed she knew. <br>
UVANOV: If we could have got her to tell us what those corpse markers
were, we'd be halfway to a confession. <br>
POUL: Halfway to two confessions. Dask knew what they were. <br>
UVANOV: Which rather rules him out. He would hardly have admitted it if
he was responsible. <br>
POUL: Have you never heard of the double bluff? <br>

UVANOV: Oh, I see. A hundred million miles of uncharted desert and you
just stumbled across us? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a small world. <br>
UVANOV: Yes. I suppose it's also a coincidence that as soon as you two
arrive, three of our people are killed? Well? <br>

just a coincidence. <br>
BORG: Why are we wasting time on them? We know they're guilty. <br>
ZILDA: We don't know anything of the sort. <br>
POUL: We just hope they're guilty. <br>
BORG: He was hiding Kerril's body in that hopper and got trapped when
it was turned on. Now that's a fact. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's an inference. I wasn't hiding that body, I was
finding it, and I'd say it was put there for precisely that reason.
Someone wanted to kill me, too. <br>
ZILDA: The murderer? <br>
POUL: No. The others were strangled. Why should he be any different? <br>
DOCTOR: To put suspicion onto me. <br>

a stowaway? <br>

ZILDA: You never had any friends. <br>
UVANOV: Have you quite finished? Look, either one of us murdered them
or they did. Which do you think is the more likely? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, ahem. There is one other possibility you seem to have
overlooked. <br>
BORG: We've heard quite enough out of you. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, you're a classic example of the inverse ratio between
the size of the mouth and the size of the brain. <br>

POUL: Because he murdered Zilda. I think he killed the others, too. <br>
TOOS: No. <br>

and they didn't want to lose him. <br>
TOOS: You must be mistaken. <br>

D84: It received a priority call to go to Section J. <br>

Answer me, please. <br>
SV7 [OC]: SV7 here. Is that you, Acting Commander Toos? <br>
TOOS: Yes. SV7, listen. Some of the Voc class robots are running

LEELA: There was something. <br>
TOOS: The robots are programmed to understand our voice patterns. <br>

DOCTOR: Of course. There had to be one. I should have thought of that
before. <br>
UVANOV: You mean you didn't know? I thought that's why we came here. <br>

UVANOV: Not any more. We're quite safe now. <br>
DOCTOR: Safe? Safe? <br>
UVANOV: Well, we'll have to send up a satellite distress beacon to get
back to base, but there's no trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: Uvanov, you remind me very strongly of a lady called Marie
Antoinette. There's a robot revolution going on out there and you say
we've got no problems. <br>
UVANOV: Doctor, every single robot has been switched off. There's not
one of them working. <br>
DOCTOR: Uvanov! Look over there. <br>
(D84 carries in Poul and lays him on a handy couch.) <br>
UVANOV: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Shut the door, Toos. I may not have time to explain. There's a
new generation of killer robots about, Uvanov. The killers are
controlled by Taren Capel, and D84 is controlled by Poul. These two are
undercover agents for the Company. <br>
D84: Poul is damaged. I do not understand what has happened to him.
This may be because I am not human. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very likely. <br>
TOOS: How did you find out about Poul? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, his body language was all wrong. <br>
LEELA: What's body language? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a theory that a person expresses himself in the way
he moves. <br>
LEELA: I said he was a hunter. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you did. Do you know what's wrong with Poul, Uvanov? <br>
UVANOV: Yes. Robophobia. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. The Loid call it Grimwade Syndrome. <br>
UVANOV: I have seen it, Doctor, once before. My very first command. A
young kid just ran outside the mine. I tried to save him, but I
couldn't. I'll never, ever, forget the look on his face. <br>
TOOS: Zilda's brother. <br>
UVANOV: His father, of course, had it all hushed up. He was afraid his
son would be thought a coward. But robophobia is a mental thing, right?
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, it is, until one gets its hands around your neck.
I don't suppose there are any weapons aboard this mine? <br>
TOOS: They aren't necessary. <br>
DOCTOR: They are now. <br>
SV7 [OC]: This is SV7. We know you are all on the Control deck. You
have five minutes to surrender. If you do not come out you will be
destroyed. <br>
UVANOV: And if we give ourselves up we'll be destroyed anyway, is that
what you're saying, 7? <br>
SV7: Humans feel pain. Our Controller orders that you will die slowly
if you do not surrender. You have, I repeat, five minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: Five minutes. And the anti-blast doors will hold another ten.
Anti-blast. Do you carry blasting powder aboard this mine? <br>
TOOS: Half a dozen Z-9 electron packs, that's all. <br>
DOCTOR: What, in here? <br>
TOOS: Up there in the locker. <br>
DOCTOR: They might work, Uvanov. If you could pass a positive charge
through the metal plate, you'd be able to magnetise them and have
anti-robot bombs. <br>
UVANOV: Yes. Provided, of course, you can get close enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Well that's your problem. I can't be everywhere at once. Toos,
open this door for me. <br>
TOOS: Where are you going, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: The robot mortuary. Toos, lock this door after us and don't let
anyone in, is that clear? <br>
TOOS: Clear. <br>
DOCTOR: D84 and Leela. Remember, Toos. If we don't come back, you'll
have to find some other way of warning the outside world. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, that's what probably triggered his collapse. <br>
(The Doctor disconnects the robot's head.) <br>
LEELA: Doctor, what is robophobia? <br>
DOCTOR: It's an unreasoning dread of robots. You see, most living
creatures use non-verbal signals. Body movement, eye contact, facial
expression, that sort of thing. <br>
LEELA: Body language. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. While these robots are humanoid, presumably for
aesthetic reasons, they give no signals. It's rather like being
surrounded by walking, talking, dead men. <br>
LEELA: That's what Poul said. <br>
(The Doctor takes the head apart.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It undermines a certain type of personality, causes
identity crisis, paranoia, sometimes even personality disintegration. <br>
(The Doctor takes a command communicator from his pocket and dismantles
that.) <br>
DOCTOR: Robophobia. At least, that's Grimwade's theory. Hold this. <br>
