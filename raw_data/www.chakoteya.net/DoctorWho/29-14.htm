[Balthazar's spaceship]</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A cyborg alien is viewing Earth from his
spaceship.) <br>
BALTAZAR: There it is. So small I could reach out and crush it. <br>
(His robot space parrot agrees.) <br>
CAW: Crush it. Crush it. <br>
BALTAZAR: Quiet, Caw. This is my moment of destiny. <br>
CAW: Moment of destiny. Moment of destiny. <br>
BALTAZAR: Attention, armoury. Prepare blaster cannons for firing.
Commence countdown. <br>
(His birdlike ship flies past the Moon.) <br>
BALTAZAR: I'm the king of the world. <br>
CAW: The world! The world! <br>
(An obsolete blue police telephone box materialises.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, forget your Bonapartes, your Boudiccas, your Blackbeards
even. <br>
BALTAZAR: What? <br>
DOCTOR: This, Martha Jones, this is Baltazar. Scourge of the galaxy,
Corsair King of Triton in the fourteenth century, the greatest despot
that ever, ever lived. <br>
MARTHA: This is just, just fantastic. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, it is kind of cool. Now, the thing about Baltazar <br>
CAW: Scourge of the galaxy. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. The most amazing thing about him is, he forged this ship
himself. <br>
MARTHA: He didn't. <br>
DOCTOR: By hand. Go on, tell her, Baltazar. <br>
BALTAZAR: I tended her by hand over countless decades. Burnished her
into the greatest warship in history. <br>
DOCTOR: And not that long ago blew all of Earth's defence forces from
the sky. You really shouldn't have done that. <br>
CAW: Shouldn't have done that. <br>
BALTAZAR: And now I'm going to envelope Earth in a field of plasma
fire, superheat the carbonites who crawl across its surface <br>
DOCTOR: Really? So then all carbon based life will be super-compressed
in a plasma field, making <br>
MARTHA: Diamonds! <br>
DOCTOR: Er, precisely. Yeah, well done. Yes, every living being turned
into diamonds. <br>
BALTAZAR: The plan starts in seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: Now that is a plan. That is indeed a plan. <br>
(Baltazar threatens the Doctor with his double-hooked arm.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is that not the most incredible plan you've ever heard? <br>
MARTHA: Oh, incredible. But we're going to stop him, yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. By giving him this. <br>
(The Doctor holds up a golden spoon.) <br>
BALTAZAR: Huh? <br>
DOCTOR: I like to stir things up. <br>
(Baltazar breaks the spoon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, shouldn't have done that. <br>
MARTHA: And he shouldn't have broken your spoon because? <br>
DOCTOR: That wasn't just any old spoon. That spoon passed through the
hands of the greatest chefs of planet Earth. Fanny, Delia, Madame
Cholette. That spoon was an antique, forged by the now extinct
inhabitants of a planet that specialised in rubicola. <br>
MARTHA: Fungus. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. But not just any old fungus. No, a special hydroxiling
fungus. There's been no treatment for it these last two thousand years,
which is why, Baltazar, scourge of the galaxy <br>
MARTHA: Your deck is rusting away. <br>
BALTAZAR: What? Nooooo! <br>
(Baltazar falls through the rotting metal.) <br>
MARTHA: That's not ordinary rust. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I pepped it up a bit. Gave it a bit of zing, a bit of
va-va-voom. <br>
CAW: Va-va-voom. Va-va-voom. <br>
MARTHA: Doctor, you can't leave him. Not to the rust. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In flight.) <br>
MARTHA: Will Baltazar ever get caught? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I imagine so. His luck can't hold out for ever. <br>
MARTHA: So what will happen, do you think? <br>
DOCTOR: In this era, the most likely Prison Planet would be er,
Volag-Noc. Yeah, that's where I'd take him if it were up to me. Coldest
place in the galaxy. <br>
MARTHA: Brr. Nasty. <br>
DOCTOR: Yup. Now, give me a number between zero and ninety nine. <br>
MARTHA: Forty five. <br>
DOCTOR: And another. <br>
MARTHA: Seventy two? <br>
DOCTOR: Another. <br>
MARTHA: Three. What is this, galactic lorry? <br>
DOCTOR: Destination setting. And you, Martha Jones, have randomly
chosen to take us to Copacabana beach. Ariba! </font></p>

into space. Then see Baltazar sitting on
the giant mechanical bird.) <br>
BALTAZAR: I'll get you for this, Doctor. I'll make you sorry you were
ever born.

[Tardis]</b>

DOCTOR: Yes! Six hundred and seventy six million miles an hour, and a
bit. Rock on! <br>
MARTHA: You're just a boy racer, aren't you. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha! Whoa! <br>
MARTHA: Whoa. What was that? Emergency stop? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, search me. There's nothing in the manual. <br>
(A giant bird has grabbed the Tardis. There is another jolt.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go on, then. We've stopped.

giant birds fly round them.) <br>
MARTHA: We've died and gone to Bill Oddy heaven. <br>
CAW: Bill Oddy heaven. Bill Oddy heaven. <br>
MARTHA: I know you. It's Caw, isn't it? <br>
CAW: Welcome to Pheros, Miss Martha. It's Caw's home. <br>
MARTHA: How are you doing, Caw? <br>
CAW: I loves you, Miss Martha. <br>
(Caw coughs a brooch depicting himself onto Martha's outstretched
palm.) <br>
MARTHA: Oh. <br>
CAW: That's for saving Caw's life all them years ago. <br>
MARTHA: Thank you, Caw. It's really lovely. <br>
(She attaches it to the front of her jacket.) <br>
CAW: Got some news for you, Doctor. About Baltazar. Let him out of
Volag-Noc. <br>
DOCTOR: Volag-Noc. I was right, Martha. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah, great. Caw, why did they release him from prison? <br>
CAW: Say he's reformed, but Caw reckons he's as bad as ever he was.
He'll be coming for Caw. Caw sold him out for a bar of gold. Or three. <br>
MARTHA: What do you need gold for? <br>
DOCTOR: He eats it. <br>
CAW: He won't rest, Doctor. He seeks his heart's desire, and knows how
to find it. <br>
DOCTOR: He does? <br>
CAW: The Infinite! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's just a legend. <br>
MARTHA: What is? <br>
CAW: Baltazar thinks different. Thinks he knows how to find it. <br>
MARTHA: Find what? <br>
DOCTOR: The Infinite. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah, I got that, but what exactly is the Infinite? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's just say there are things out there in space,
Martha. Things that predate our reality. Relics from the Dark Times. <br>
MARTHA: Oh, a fairy tale. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, far, far more than that. There was a time when the universe
was so much smaller than it is now. A darker, older time of chaos.
Creatures like the Racnoss, the Nestines and the Great Vampires
rampaged through the void. <br>
MARTHA: And this Infinite, this is one of those relics from the Dark
Time. <br>
DOCTOR: It's said that if anyone were to find the Infinite they'd
receive their heart's desire. And frankly, that's quite a thing to
receive. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah, but how's Baltazar going to find it? <br>
(Caw coughs up another metal item with an infinity symbol on it.) <br>
CAW: That's how. <br>
MARTHA: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a data chip. Part of a black box recorder. Dark Time
technology. <br>
CAW: Baltazar gave it to me for safe keeping. Should be four of them.
You need to use each one to find the next. <br>
MARTHA: And find all four, you find the Infinite. Are we going on a
quest, then? <br>
DOCTOR: No. The Infinite stays lost. It's nothing more than a legend.
As last Custodian to the secrets of the universe it's my duty to see it
stays that way. <br>
(The Doctor is about to stamp on the data chip.) <br>
CAW: You mustn't. Mustn't. He's got a copy. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't let someone like Baltazar, someone as corrupt and
twisted as he is, have access to that kind of power. Caw, you'd better
be right about this.

BALTAZAR: The tracker's in place. <br>
CAW: Ahem. Thank you, caw. It's really lovely. <br>
BALTAZAR: The Doctor's going to find me the Infinite. Going to find me
my heart's desire. <br>
CAW: Heart's desire. Heart's desire! <br>
BALTAZAR: And then I'll have my revenge! <br>
CAW: Revenge! Revenge!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A desolate, orange place.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Martha, see those? Artificial suns. <br>
MARTHA: Never. <br>
DOCTOR: Someone wanted the planet Boukon warmed up. <br>
MARTHA: What are they? <br>
(Giant metallic things on legs sucking liquid from the ground.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oil rigs. <br>
MARTHA: Oil rigs? Hang on, they still need oil in the future? <br>
DOCTOR: It ran out on Earth. The Corporations went drilling elsewhere. <br>
MARTHA: To look at them you'd think they were alive. <br>
(The rigs disengage their suction tubes and turn towards them.) <br>
DOCTOR: You think? Run? <br>
(Not a chance.) <br>
MARTHA: What now? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, well, I'm open to suggestions. <br>
(Two harpoons slam into the nearest rig's legs.) <br>
DOCTOR: How'd you do that? Oh, Martha, you're brilliant. Oh yeah, now
you're just showing off. Whoa! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The ground on which they are standing turns out to
be the deck of a sort of desert submarine-type vessel, which is now
surfacing and rising into the air. The Tardis topples off onto the
ground.) <br>
KALIKO: Hoist the colours, Mister Mate! <br>
(The mate is at a ships wheel on the deck.) <br>
SWABB: Aye, aye, Captain. <br>
KALIKO: Let Oil Corp see that the Black Gold is in business. <br>
SWABB: Aye, aye, Captain. Arr. <br>
(A skull and crossbones lights up on the conning tower.) <br>
DOCTOR + MARTHA: Pirates? <br>
SWABB: I'm Swabb, first mate aboard the Black <br>
(The Captain comes out of the conning tower. It is a woman with beaded
braids and an eye patch.) <br>
KALIKO: Now then, Mister Mate, put her in reverse. <br>
SWABB: Aye, aye, Captain. <br>
KALIKO: You two might want to hold on tight. <br>
(The Doctor and Martha clutch each other.) <br>
KALIKO: To the rail. <br>
DOCTOR: Aye, aye, Captain. <br>
KALIKO: Take the strain, me hearties. <br>
SWABB: Heave, lads. <br>
KALIKO: All right, Swabb, maximum power. <br>
SWABB: Aye! <br>
(The vessel zooms forward, through the rig's legs, pulling on the
harpoon cables and bringing it down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that I didn't expect. <br>
KALIKO: Cut thrust, Mister Mate. <br>
SWABB: Arr, and pull the rig in? <br>
KALIKO: And siphon it, Swabb. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello there, Captain. <br>
KALIKO: Captain Kaliko. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello there. I'm the Doctor. Martha and I <br>
MARTHA: Doctor, why are they smashing up the oil rigs? <br>
DOCTOR: I told you it was the fortieth century. The last great oil
corporations are sucking the solar system dry to feed demand. Petrol
prices have gone through the roof, of course, and the colonies that
can't afford to pay are dying. <br>
KALIKO: Aye, and the oil companies call us pirates. <br>
DOCTOR: So you're smashing the rigs, siphoning off the petrol. I see. <br>
MARTHA: Robbing the rich to fuel the poor. But that's brilliant. <br>
KALIKO: What do you think we should do with them, Swabb? <br>
SWABB: I don't know, Captain. <br>
KALIKO: Now what I reckon is, to land up in a place like this, you dogs
are either Oil Corp
spies or planning a spot of pirating yourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: Or, indeed, none of the above. <br>
KALIKO: Either way, I don't want you on the Black Gold, so ahoy there,
me heartless hearties, throw these sand-lovers overboard. <br>
(Her crew are revealed to be skeletons in spacesuits, with laser
cutlasses. Then Swabb fires a laser pistol into the air.) <br>
SWABB: Hold hard there, lads. <br>
KALIKO: Swabb, you swab, is this mutiny? <br>
MARTHA: Yes! <br>
SWABB: Never, Captain Kaliko, not mutiny. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
SWABB: I just wondered if they be Oil Corp spies, mayhaps we dispose of
the bodies by putting them inside one of they rigs, ha, ha! Make it
look like an accident. <br>
KALIKO: You're not as empty headed as you seems, Mister Mate. We'll use
the one we just keel-hauled. <br>
SWABB: Aye, aye, Captain. (sotto) Don't worry, Doctor, Martha, you're
perfectly safe with me. <br>
MARTHA: What's he up to? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think our Mister Swabb is all he's cracked up to be. I
wonder. <br>
(The floating Black Gold starts siphoning the fuel from the wrecked
rig.) <br>
KALIKO: Said your prayers yet, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: So, er, sorry, let me see if I've got this right. We somehow
get inside this rig that you've drained of oil and er, then what? <br>
KALIKO: A quick blast from me mate Swabb's laser pistol, the remaining
oil ignites. <br>
DOCTOR: Oil Corp find us dead inside, boiled in oil. <br>
MARTHA: That's murder! <br>
KALIKO: Accidents happen. Now, me hearties, the plank. <br>
(A plank emerges from the prow of the Black Gold. Swabb steps forward.)
<br>
MARTHA: Careful with that. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, ah, ah. Me first. (sotto) I thought Swabb would have made
his move by now. <br>
MARTHA: (sotto) What move? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) He's no pirate. If he thinks we're with this Oil Corp
then my guess is <br>
MARTHA: (sotto) That he is too. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Fingers crossed. (normal) Ready. <br>
(The Doctor stands on the plank. Of course, he's done this before, in <a href="16-2.htm"><font color="#000000"> Pirate
Planet</font></a>.) <br>
KALIKO: I like your style, Doctor. Shame you have to die. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br>
(He aims his sonic screwdriver at her.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, let us go or I'll destroy your ship. <br>
KALIKO: What, with that? No deal. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I wish you weren't so obstinate, Kaliko. Oh, well. <br>
(The screwdriver coughs and splutters.) <br>
MARTHA: Why is it not working? <br>
DOCTOR: Patience. Sand, in the mechanism. Hang on. <br>
(He blows on it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Success! <br>
KALIKO: And? <br>
DOCTOR: And, hold on tight. <br>
(The sonic vibrations make the wheel go bang and the skull and
crossbones goes out.) <br>
KALIKO: Cor, dog, you're damaging the Black Gold. <br>
MARTHA: We're actually on your side, Captain. We came here to save you.
<br>
SWABB: It's all right, Martha. The Captain's pirate days are over. I'm
with Oil Corp. <br>
DOCTOR: Told you. <br>
SWABB: And Oil Corp have promised me a new body to replace this bag of
bones. Same goes for you, me hearties, if you'll help me turn the
Captain in. <br>
KALIKO: They'll never turn on me. <br>
(The crew step forward.) <br>
KALIKO: Oh, no. <br>
DOCTOR: Thing is, Captain, Swabb here seems to think Martha and I are
with Oil Corp, too. <br>
SWABB: You're not? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
KALIKO: You're not? <br>
MARTHA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Captain, we've come here to rescue you. <br>
KALIKO: What? <br>
SWABB: Doesn't matter, Captain. Your time is up. Rigs, attack! <br>
(The remaining two rigs fire their lasers at the Black Gold.) <br>
DOCTOR: Lucky they're not great shots. <br>
MARTHA: Define lucky. <br>
SWABB: No! More precision! Fire with more Argh! <br>
(The oil rigs do as they are told.) <br>
DOCTOR: Roll with it, Martha! <br>
(The Black Gold crashes into the sand.) <br>
MARTHA: Doctor? Doctor? Eek! <br>
SWABB: Forget it. He's gone. But at least I can think of a good use for
you. <br>
MARTHA: Oh, really? <br>
SWABB: Yeah. <br>
(Kaliko stands up behind Swabb.) <br>
MARTHA: Look, you. Me and the Doctor, we're not here to cause you and
Oil Corp any trouble, right? We're on a mission. A dead important one.
Got to collect these data chips, you see, stop this Baltazar guy from
stealing a big spaceship called the Infinite which will give him, well,
infinite power I suppose, and that's a bad thing because he's not a
nice bloke, and Swabb? <br>
SWABB: Yeah? <br>
MARTHA: Behind you. <br>
(Swabb turns. Kaliko waves bye to him then ) <br>
DOCTOR: Aye, aye. <br>
(The Doctor pops up between them on the ship's wheel, knocking Swabb
backwards. He staggers onto the plank.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, sorry. <br>
MARTHA: Doctor! <br>
(Kaliko retracts the plank and Swabb falls to the ground.) <br>
KALIKO: Will the vile dog live? <br>
MARTHA: Well, the sand seemed dead soft so it probably broke his fall. <br>
SWABB [OC]: I'll get you for this! <br>
MARTHA: Yep, he's okay. You need some help with that? <br>
DOCTOR: Could you? Ouch, ow. <br>
(Martha helps the Doctor untangle himself from the wheel spokes.) <br>
KALIKO: Doctor, you said you'd come here for me. What exactly did you
mean by that? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
KALIKO: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Your earring, Captain. Do you know what it is, really? <br>
(Kaliko laughs.) <br>
KALIKO: You're after the Infinite. You fool! Now, I was going to offer
you both a berth on my next ship, but seeing as how you had an ulterior
motive in rescuing me <br>
(The conning tower doors close between them.) <br>
KALIKO: There's only room for one in my lifeboat anyhow. <br>
(The top of the tower takes off into the sky, then two parachutes
deploy.) <br>
MARTHA: Looks like she came down somewhere near the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: We have to catch up with her. If Baltazar gets that data chip
and finds the Infinite <br>
MARTHA: He gets his heart's desire. The destruction of you, me and
Earth.

Shush, shush, shush. Hey, hey, hey, I'm not going to hurt you. <br>

KELVIN: Thank you. Thank you so much. I. Training didn't prepare me, I
didn't. <br>
DOCTOR: Hey, shush. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.
Calm down, you're fine now. <br>
KELVIN: Sorry. My suit got damaged when I came down. No air left. I
thought I was going to die. I don't want to die. <br>
MARTHA: Well, you didn't. <br>
QUEEN: Fleshy biped. We must be protected from fleshy bipeds. Destroy
them all! <br>
MEREGRASS: You can destroy them, your Majesty, with the weapons you've
bought. <br>
DOCTOR: What's your name, Pilot? <br>
KELVIN: Pilot Kelvin, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Pilot Kelvin, what's wrong with you? Picking a fight with
a bunch of defenceless bugs? <br>
KELVIN: Eh? We didn't start it. <br>
QUEEN: Yes, they did. The fleshy bipeds have been trying to
exterminate, wipe us out. <br>
KELVIN: No, you don't understand. This is my er, this was my home,
where I was born, brought up. We were here first! <br>
DOCTOR: Is this true? <br>
KELVIN: This used to be a lovely place. My parents had a homestead
here. Then the bugs arrived and drove the people out. I only joined up
once my parents were killed. <br>
DOCTOR: Killed? Why? Why did you attack? <br>
QUEEN: So many lovely animals they had here. So much lovely dung. <br>
MARTHA: You invaded this planet for dung? <br>
KELVIN: It's one of the last fertile planets in the galaxy. If it
falls, there'll be a famine like you wouldn't believe. <br>
MEREGRASS: Your Majesty, if I may. My job here is done. I have supplied
you with means to destroy your enemies. Your contract stipulates final
payment on delivery. <br>
QUEEN: Oh, did it? Guess what, Meregrass. I lied! There will be no
payment. Mantasphids do not make deals with fleshy bipeds. <br>
MEREGRASS: Typical Mantasphid. I should have listened to the others. <br>
MARTHA: What others? <br>
MEREGRASS: The other prisoners. There was a Mantasphid there, too, who
tipped me off about this little war, so I decided to do the deal. <br>
MARTHA: You were in prison? <br>
MEREGRASS: Good grief no. I was a broker, a dealer. I could get letters
and gifts to the inmates, and in return <br>
DOCTOR: You got well paid? <br>
MEREGRASS: Mmm, of course. But the Governor always said that you could
never trust a Mantasphid. <br>
DOCTOR: The Governor of which prison was this? Volag-Noc, perhaps? <br>
MARTHA: Volag-Noc. Isn't that where Baltazar was? <br>
MEREGRASS: You know of Baltazar? <br>
(Air raid sirens wail.) <br>
QUEEN: The fly ships, they're coming back. Bugs, defend us. They'll
destroy it all. <br>
MEREGRASS: We're going to die here too unless we get out of here. <br>
KELVIN: Forget it. You can't get far enough away. <br>
MARTHA: Why not? <br>
KELVIN: Because Earth Command can't afford to lose this planet. You
see, they've even
sacrificed me. <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty, listen to me. There might still be a way. <br>
QUEEN: Ah, Doctor, this is a fleshy biped thing, is it not? Never say
die <br>
MARTHA: Yeah, exactly. <br>
QUEEN: Fleshy bipeds are very stupid creatures, but the fight goes on.
We'll win this war yet. <br>
MARTHA: Pilot Kelvin, what will they do to the city? <br>
KELVIN: Well, the plan was spatial disintegration of this hundred mile
vector. <br>
DOCTOR: They're going to burn us out of space and time. <br>
KELVIN: Kills all known bugs. Dead. <br>
MARTHA: So we stand here while they vapourise us? <br>
QUEEN: Meregrass, what do we do? <br>
MEREGRASS: You're asking me? <br>
QUEEN: You are my military advisor. You know tactics, you know weapons.
Help us! <br>
MEREGRASS: I'd have happily helped you when I thought I was getting
paid, but without this the weapons are useless. And without my money,
you get nothing. <br>
QUEEN: Meregrass. Meregrass! <br>
(Meregrass leaves.) <br>
QUEEN: Come back! <br>
DOCTOR: We need to keep track of Meregrass. He has the datachip we need
to continue this treasure hunt. <br>
QUEEN: It is decided. How do we surrender to the fleshy bipeds? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, at last. Pilot Kelvin, have you got a communications
system? <br>
KELVIN: Inside my helmet, sir, but it was damaged when I crashed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we'll soon have that sorted. <br>
QUEEN: Hurry, hurry. <br>
(The Doctor does a sonic repair.) <br>
QUEEN: We want to surrender. <br>
KELVIN: Doctor, there's no protocol for negotiation with the
Mantasphids. <br>
MARTHA: Then make one. <br>
KELVIN: I can't! They invaded our homes, killed our families. <br>
DOCTOR: They are also living, sentient beings that have a right to
exist. Maybe not here, but somewhere. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Mantasphid Hive destruction commences in sixty seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, that's not good. <br>
QUEEN: Please, Doctor. Hurry. <br>
MARTHA: Doctor, listen, if the bugs can't surrender, surely we can,
can't we? <br>
DOCTOR: You are brilliant! Pilot, tell them to open up a visual
channel. <br>
KELVIN: Control, this is Pilot Kelvin. Imperative you open a visual
link to this helmet's communication system now. Please respond. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Roger. <br>
QUEEN: Hurry, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: (Pirate) Ahoy there, ye Earth Command nobodies. You got Doctor
Vile, Pilot of the Constellations given you a big white flag. Fact is,
me and me mad mucker Martha here <br>
MARTHA: Arr. Arr. Arr. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) No, no, don't, don't do that. (Pirate) We been ruling
it over these insect raiders, held their Queen here hostage. But, we
have to admit, you got us beaten. Come on in and get us. We surrender!
(transmission ends.) That should do it. <br>
QUEEN: What have you done, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Taken the rap for you, Queenie. Ended your war. <br>
MARTHA: They'll never believe it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you reckon? <br>
CONTROL [OC]: All units, Hive destruction cancelled. Your priority now
is to apprehend male human codename Doctor Bile. <br>
QUEEN: How can we thank you, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Easy. Work with the humans, not against them. Young Kelvin here
can make a great ambassador. <br>
KELVIN: Me? <br>
DOCTOR: Now, listen, your Majesty. The human's farms will need power.
Light and heat are hard to come by in an oil-starved universe, right? <br>
MARTHA: And you're naturally phosphorescent. <br>
DOCTOR: Think you could make a deal? <br>
MARTHA: And you get all the dung you could ever want. Brilliant! So
what's next? <br>

MARTHA: Gotcha! I said, I don't believe this. <br>
(Her heart's desire vanishes.) <br>
MARTHA: Oh, yes! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't even try to find my heart's desire. <br>
MARTHA: Hello you, proper you. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Now then, aren't you going to ask me how I got here, and
hear all about my adventures on Volag-Noc? How I bottle-fed Squawk with
my own gold and reprogrammed Lok to run a better prison? It's been
three years, you know. <br>
MARTHA: Three years? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, two and three quarters. We gained a bit of that by flying
past lightspeed, of course. <br>
MARTHA: Lightspeed? How? <br>
DOCTOR: I gave Squawk's engines a bit of pep, bit of zing. bit of <br>
MARTHA: Va-va-voom? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
MARTHA: I knew you'd be back. So, this is the Infinite. <br>
DOCTOR: Every pirate and freebooter and treasure hunter dreams of it
and wants to find this. <br>
MARTHA: Their heart's desire. What did it show you, by the way? <br>
DOCTOR: Doesn't matter. Didn't work on me. Anyway, whatever power this
place once had is fading away daily. The whole ship's only held
together by wishes and hopes. <br>
MARTHA: There's nothing living here, is there. <br>
DOCTOR: Not now. One of the great Old Ones was once. It died out here,
alone and lost, screaming its rage and fury into the solitude until its
unique power dissipated. Just left a little fading echo, enough to give
us a glimpse of our heart's desire. <br>
(Baltazar laughs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. <br>
(A massive pile of gold bars fills the hold, bigger than a dragon's
horde.) <br>
BALTAZAR: Gold. Diamonds. Treasure, Doctor, enough treasure to buy me a
new ship. A whole fleet. And I can destroy you, Earth, Volag-Noc, and
everything in between. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, be scourge of the galaxy again, is that the best you can
think of? <br>
MARTHA: It's not real. It's just an echo of the power <br>
DOCTOR: He's not listening, Martha. The ship's so old and rusted, just
held together by wishful thinking. <br>
(One whiz of the sonic screwdriver, and the horde vanishes. The
superstructure begins to crumble.) <br>
MARTHA: Come on, Captain Useless.
