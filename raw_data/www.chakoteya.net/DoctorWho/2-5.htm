somehow we’ve materialised, for a split second of time, and been
imprisoned in some kind of force. I simply can’t break its hold.

DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh. <br>
IAN: Doctor, can’t there just be something wrong with the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong? My boy, we’ve been dragged off our course. The question
is, is it some natural phenomena or is it intelligent, deliberate, or
for a purpose, hmm? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, you’ll find the answer, Doctor. You always do. <br>

DOCTOR: It’s an Atmospheric Density Jacket, to be precise. Oh, I see.
Is the atmosphere a bit thin? <br>

everything and those pills belong to the Doctor. <br>

DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, I can’t see any spooks or anything. I don’t
think so, no. Not particularly, no. I must say that if I lived here and
I heard you roaring your head off, I’d probably come down and take a
look at you. <br>
IAN: Then take my pen? <br>

taken your pen? Of course! Ha ha! Now then, there’s something for us to

Vortis hasn’t the moon’s and here, there there are several. Look, you
see? You can see for yourself. <br>
IAN: Yes. Can’t a planet attract satellites to itself, Doctor? <br>

not, I can’t be sure. Anyway, lets, come on, over here. </font></p>

BARBARA: Why do they make us heap this vegetation into the acid

HROSTAR: It is the raw material for the Carsinome, where the Zarbi
live. Fed into these pools, it is drawn to the centre through
underground streams, and as we pour it in, the Carsinome grows and
reaches out across Vortis. <br>
BARBARA: Well, what lies at the centre? <br>
HROSTAR: None of us have ever seen it and lived, but we call it the
Animus. <br>
(A Zarbi harries them again) <br>
BARBARA: Do you understand them? <br>
HROSTAR: No. They are just cattle. They do not have any speech nor
motive of their own. Just controlled sentries. We came here to liberate
them. It was disaster. Vrestin, the others, we arrived in advance of
the spearhead. Our weapons proved useless. They were taken by the Zarbi
who were everywhere. The three of us you met in the cave got away with
the communicator, but we could not contact our spearhead. <br>
BARBARA: Well, when is it due to arrive? <br>

banishment has taught us of enemies and weapons, and my captivity has
taught me strategy. They tore my wings from me and I felt, as you feel,
that all was lost. But if our Gods favour our survival, we must learn
their lesson and use our brains and not our wings. This Earth woman we

and flourish. What should we do? <br>

<br>
BARBARA: The best idea is still that we create a mock attack here in
the south in order to draw off the Zarbi. Then whilst this is
happening, one of us tries to get in the centre from the north. <br>
HILIO: It will fail. Even if it drew most of the Zarbi, it would
require just one larvae gun to stop the real attack. <br>
BARBARA: Then what is your idea? <br>
HILIO: I could fly over the Carsinome and try and cut my way in from
above. <br>
PRAPILLUS: No, the Carsinome is strong and vigorous. It would heal
itself before you could cut your way through. <br>
BARBARA: Then we’re left with the mock attack. It isn’t perfect, I
know, but it’s all we have. <br>
HILIO: Very well, I will go in alone from the north. <br>
HROSTAR: No, I will go. <br>
HLYNIA: Quiet! There’s someone outside. <br>
BARBARA: Locks the doors! <br>
HROSTAR: Too late! <br>
HILIO: Hide! <br>
PRAPILLUS: If it’s Zarbi, the doors will not open. <br>

interesting. <br>
BARBARA: Will it work, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don’t see why not, my dear. What is in the centre of the
web, hmm? Do you know? <br>
HILIO: No. <br>
PRAPILLUS: No one knows. An alien from the darkness of space but the
shape inside the cocoon. <br>
BARBARA: But if it arrived here from another planet, surely some one
must have seen it? <br>
PRAPILLUS: Our legends of it only begin when it was already thinking
itself into the crannies of Vortis and the minds of the Zarbi,
spreading its web. <br>
DOCTOR: Where does it draw its power from, hmm? <br>
PRAPILLUS: Is there is power in the magnetic pole of the planet? That
is where the web has its centre. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the magnetic pole, I see, I see. You mean it draws and
uses the power from the planet Vortis. <br>
PRAPILLUS: Yes, Doctor. Their theory would would explain the new moons
that have appeared in the sky. They too are drawn here by this power. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder why I didn’t realise that before. The same force
drew and holds the Tardis here. Yes, of course, it’s remarkable, most
interesting. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, do you intend to go ahead with the plan? <br>
DOCTOR: The plan? The plan. Yes, my dear, yes. Yes, but with a slight
difference. <br>
HROSTAR: How different? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think we’ll go ahead with the mock attack as planned,
that will be your responsibility, my dear. A time we shall agree to. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, Doctor. <br>
HILIO: And this? <br>
DOCTOR: That, I shall take along with me. The girl and I will return to
the Zarbi headquarters <br>

HILIO: Our wise men have put all their skill into this one Isop-tope. I
cannot yield it to a stranger. <br>
HROSTAR: Wait. Can you take the Isop-tope past the Zarbi guards in
safety? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. I don’t see why not? <br>
BARBARA: Prapillus! <br>
PRAPILLUS: Hilio, he is the first friend of the Menoptra ever to leave
the Carsinome. We must trust the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(Hilio hands over the Isop-tope) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. I have great admiration for your wise men and their
judgement. Now, my dear, is everything quite clear, hmm? BARBARA: Yes,
Doctor. You will return to headquarters. Once you’re safely there, we
start the attack to draw out the Zarbi while you make for the centre. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. Come, child. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, have we got to? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, now, now, now, cheer up, cheer up. I don’t particularly
want to go back there myself. <br>
VICKI: It’s all right. I suppose we do have the best chance. Anyway,
the Tardis is still there. <br>
PRAPILLUS: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, what is it? What do you want? Excuse me. Well, what do you
want, hmm? <br>
PRAPILLUS: I wondered if we could borrow this creature? I think he
would be very useful in our attack. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you think so, do you? <br>
PRAPILLUS: I have made a study of the Zarbi. I think I could make use
of him. <br>
DOCTOR: You do? Better than I? <br>
PRAPILLUS: Please, I have no wish to offend, but you don’t know the
Zarbi as I do. <br>
DOCTOR: To control him, you will have to use my ring. And that is of
untold value. <br>
PRAPILLUS: And what of the value of our Isop-tope? <br>
BARBARA: Is anything wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: No! No, my dear, no! <br>
PRAPILLUS: A small matter. <br>
DOCTOR: Our friend here has suggested that the creature goes along with
your party. <br>
PRAPILLUS: And I was thanking the Doctor for his faith in our
Isop-tope. <br>
BARBARA: That’s a very good idea, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? (he gives his ring to Prapillus) Here, take it! <br>
PRAPILLUS: May I know its secret? <br>
