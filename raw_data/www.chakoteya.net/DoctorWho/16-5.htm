uniforms. A tall greying man enters, wearing a short cloak and carrying
a rifle.) <br>
FENNER: Thawn, I saw your landing. How did things go on Delta Magna? <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0535053/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Philip
Madoc</a>, Whovian villain par excellence.) <br>
THAWN: Oh, fine, but after a few months here you notice how crowded
it's becoming. <br>
(Fenner puts Thawn's rifle in the gun rack behind his desk, and Thawn
takes a silver bag from a green-haired and green-skinned man who
followed him in.) <br>
FENNER: Want a drink? <br>
THAWN: Out. Er, yes, please. <br>
(The green man leaves with a glare at Thawn.) <br>
THAWN: Harg! Your Lytteker micros. <br>
(He hands the bag to a ginger haired man.) <br>
HARG: Oh, thank you, sir. <br>
THAWN: Five hundred of them. I got you the complete library. <br>
HARG: Magnificent. How much do I owe you? <br>
THAWN: Oh, don't worry about that. <br>
(The man at a large control desk groans.) <br>
DUGEEN: Oh. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to the voice of K9, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498770/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> John Leeson</a>.) <br>
THAWN: What's the matter with you. <br>
FENNER: I didn't offer him a drink. <br>
DUGEEN: I'm getting an echo track on here. <br>
FENNER: Well, try it again. <br>
DUGEEN: I've tried it, I've tried it. Look. Look at this. <br>
(Harg goes over.) <br>
DUGEEN: Now look, that's Thawn's track. He's about twelve miles out
there, coming in now. This is where the other track starts to show, do
you see? <br>
HARG: Yes. <br>
THAWN: What do you think it is? <br>
DUGEEN: Well, I think you were followed down, sir, by somebody using
your track as a cover. <br>
HARG: Who would dare? <br>
FENNER: And it's definitely another ship?&nbsp;<br>
DUGEEN: Yeah. <br>
THAWN: Where has it landed? <br>
DUGEEN: Oh, out in the swamp somewhere. <br>
FENNER: They split off at the last second. <br>
DUGEEN: You see, the scanners were only set to check your approach to
the pad. Any secondary plotting would have been irrelevant. <br>
HARG: But who would risk it? There's nothing out there but a wasteland.
<br>
THAWN: Gentlemen, there is a rumour on Delta Magna that the Sons of
Earth are planning to arm the Swampies. <br>
FENNER: There are times I could well do without those Sons of Earth. <br>
HARG: Oh, but surely nobody would give arms to those savages? <br>
THAWN: Those savages, Harg, are getting a lot of sentimental support.
The Company is putting a lot of effort into making a more balanced
picture, but you've got to remember that most people on Delta Magna
have never even seen a Swampie. <br>
HARG: Oh, but even so, sir, it's un <br>
FENNER: If these Swampies were given weapons that could well lead to
them attacking the refinery. <br>
THAWN: It could well lead to that. <br>
DUGEEN: The Sons of Earth wouldn't be likely to arm the Swampies.
They've always condemned violence. <br>
FENNER: I don't know. There was a report a couple of days ago in the
routine daily circular that Rohm-Dutt's ship had vanished from Elvedon
Port and all stations have been told to watch out for him. <br>
HARG: Rohm-Dutt? He is involved in gun-running, isn't he. <br>
FENNER: Yes, he is involved in gun-running. <br>
DUGEEN: Do you think that's his ship out there? <br>
FENNER: I don't know, but whoever it is, if he's making for the
settlement, he's got to cross the swamps. <br>
THAWN: In which case, he may never reach the settlement. <br>
(Thawn gets his rifle.) <br>
THAWN: Those swamps can be awfully dangerous. Fenner! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Swamp]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises in a reed bed that
reaches almost to her flashing blue light. This is the Maltings near
Snape in Suffolk, a tidal marsh formed by the River Alde.) <br>
ROMANA: Was it absolutely necessary to land in a quagmire? <br>
DOCTOR: Well I told you it was a bit swampy. It's not the Tardis'
fault, anyway. These marshes go on for miles. A little water doesn't
hurt. <br>
ROMANA: Try telling that to K9. He's marooned. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we won't be here long enough to need K9. Come on. <br>
(They clamber up onto a piece of raised dry land. The Doctor raises his
arm a few times then drops his hat.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gravity check. Escape velocity about one point five miles a
second. <br>
ROMANA: Really? Isn't that a little low for a planet? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. This must be one of the moons of Delta Magna. <br>
(He wets his finger and holds it up.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'd say the third. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor? Sometimes I don't think you're quite right in the head.
<br>
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Just point the tracer and see where we
go next. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, it's not a very clear reading. It's a very diffuse signal.
It seems to cover about forty two and a half degrees in that direction.
<br>
DOCTOR: Forty two and a half degrees? <br>
ROMANA: Hmm. I don't like the sound of that. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
ROMANA: It either means the source is right on top of us, which it
isn't. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, or else the tracer's developed a fault. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, well, perhaps the atmosphere here's affecting it. I know,
I'll try the higher ground here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, why don't you try the higher ground there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the refinery]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Fenner and Thawn have put on plastic jackets and
gloves.) <br>
FENNER: What's this Rohm-Dutt look like? <br>
THAWN: Bit of a hard case. Dresses the part. Wide-brimmed hat,
bandolier. We can't miss him. <br>
FENNER: I don't intend to. <br>
(The pair set off across the flooded mudflats in a small hovercraft
piloted by a third man.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has harvested a few reeds and is
trimming one of them with a penknife. He turns it into a flute and
starts playing JS Bach's Badinere in B minor, from Orchestral Suite no
2. Meanwhile, Romana is failing to get a firm reading from the tracer,
and a scruffy man is leading a group of green-skinned men in canoes
through the marsh. Romana moves further on, and is suddenly grabbed by
two green men. She drops the tracer. The Doctor finally hears the
hovercraft approaching.) <br>
DOCTOR: Romana? Romana? <br>
THAWN: There he is. <br>
(Fenner shoots at the Doctor standing on the skyline. He falls.) <br>
THAWN: I think you've hit him. <br>
(Romana has been put into the canoe.) <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Just the one shot.<br>
(Everyone say Hi! to the prolific <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0654148/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Glyn Owen</a>.) <br>
VARLIK: We're near the refinery here. Perhaps one of the dryfoots is
out hunting. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: What, that lot? They're technicians, Varlik. Technicians
don't hunt. They can't use their computers. Come on, now. Come, we must
hurry. <br>
(They paddle the canoe away. Fenner and Thawn run over the ridge where
the Doctor was standing to find him lying face down on the other side.)
<br>
FENNER: So much for Rohm-Dutt. I never did like gun runners. <br>
THAWN: That's enough. That's not Rohm-Dutt. <br>
FENNER: What do you mean, it isn't Rohm-Dutt? You told me. His hat and
everything. <br>
THAWN: I tell you it is not Rohm-Dutt. You've shot the wrong man. <br>
DOCTOR: Not quite. You shot the wrong man's hat, though. Fancy taking
me for Rohm-Dutt. <br>
FENNER: Who are you, then. Go on, tell us. What are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a sort of survey. I've lost my friend. <br>
FENNER: Who sent you? <br>
DOCTOR: Something must have happened to her. Look at the way those
reeds are crushed. <br>
THAWN: The Swampies must have got her. <br>
DOCTOR: Swampies? Are they the local tribes here? <br>
FENNER: Yes. They've never come so near the refinery before. They're
getting bolder, aren't they. <br>
THAWN: If they jump us here, we don't stand a chance. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, how do I get in touch with these Swampies? <br>
FENNER: What's that? <br>
THAWN: You're coming with us. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. I'm looking for my friend. You see, she's
important to me. <br>
THAWN: I insist. There are a lot of very important questions yet to be
answered. <br>
DOCTOR: Fine. Shush. Will there be strawberry jam for tea? <br>
(Thawn takes the Doctor away at gunpoint.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Romana has her hands tied behind her back, and
then fastened to a rock. Other Swampies carry a long wooden box past.) <br>
ROHM-DUTT: You know, there's a thing called a drill fly in these
swamps. Lays its eggs in your feet. A week later, you get holes in your
head. <br>
ROMANA: How long am I going to be tied up here? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Well, that depends. <br>
ROMANA: On what? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: On whether you cooperate. If you don't, you'll rot there.
Won't take long in this climate. <br>
ROMANA: And that doesn't bother you? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Young woman, I'm indifferent. <br>
ROMANA: Emotional insulation is usually indicative of psychofugal
trauma. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: I didn't know that. <br>
(Thunder rumbles in the distance.) <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Ah, I've never known such a place for rainstorms. That's why
it's so wet. <br>
ROMANA: How do I cooperate? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Are you with the refinery? <br>
ROMANA: What refinery?&nbsp;<br>
ROHM-DUTT: Ah. Good. <br>
ROMANA: What's good? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: I thought you'd lie. I happen to know they don't employ
women there. <br>
ROMANA: Look, I don't know what you're talking about. I haven't heard
of any refinery or <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Now, there's no need to get excited. There's plenty of time
to dig out the truth. <br>
ROMANA: I am telling you the truth. Who do you think I am? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Did they send you here alone? <br>
ROMANA: Nobody sent me. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: How many are with you? <br>
ROMANA: Just the Doctor. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: The Doctor? And where is he? <br>
ROMANA: Looking for me, I expect. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: What were you doing in the swamp? <br>
ROMANA: Catching butterflies. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Oh, I like a joke. <br>
ROMANA: I'll try and think of one. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: What were you doing in the swamp? <br>
ROMANA: Look, you'd be none the wiser if I did tell you. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: What were you doing in the swamp? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Pump chamber]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The storm is coming, and we now see that the
refinery is like an oil rig, standing in choppy waters. The Doctor is
pushed in through the outer door and falls to the floor.) <br>
HARG: Oh, good. You got him. <br>
THAWN: This isn't Rohm-Dutt. <br>
HARG: What? <br>
FENNER: We don't know who it is. We found him in the prohibited area. <br>
DOCTOR: You should put up the usual notices. Trespassers will be shot.
Who is Rohm-Dutt? <br>
FENNER: He's a gun-runner. Don't you know him? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm new here. <br>
THAWN: What were you doing out there? <br>
DOCTOR: I told you, looking for my friend. <br>
THAWN: Well, looking for a friend in a prohibited area a hundred yards
from a classified project could lead you into a lot of trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: What classified project? <br>
FENNER: You're in the middle of it. <br>
DOCTOR: What, this? A methane catalysing refinery, classified? <br>
THAWN: So you admit that you know what it is? <br>
DOCTOR: What? Well, of course I know what it is. I've seen hundreds of
them. <br>
HARG: He's crazy. <br>
FENNER: This is a pilot plant, the first ever built. <br>
DOCTOR: You Earth colonists are always so insular. If you'd been to
Binaca-Ananda, you'd see one in every town. <br>
THAWN: Get up! Are you claiming that you're from outside this
constellation? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
THAWN: And how did you get here? <br>
DOCTOR: I have my own transport. <br>
HARG: He is crazy. <br>
DOCTOR: Will you stop saying that? What gives him an insight into my
mental processes? <br>
THAWN: All right, expert, what's that? <br>
DOCTOR: That's an air vent. <br>
THAWN: Not that, that! <br>
DOCTOR: It's a funicular gas separator. <br>
THAWN: And that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it looks to me like a primitive enzyme recycler, with an
injection circuit feeding the bacterium bioplast. I imagine that the
raw protein is centrifuged before being freeze-dried and compressed for
packaging. I think you'd find it more efficient if you inserted a
plasmin catalyst ahead of the bioplast circuit. <br>
THAWN: A plasmin catalyst? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, why not? <br>
HARG: But that's brilliant! <br>
FENNER: Oh, yes, that's brilliant. <br>
THAWN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I free to go now? <br>
THAWN: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
THAWN: What were you doing out there? <br>
DOCTOR: Right. A sort of mineralogical survey. Look, I've got to go and
find my friend. <br>
FENNER: I wouldn't. You see, if the Swampies have taken him to their
settlement, then you'll never reach him, because those swamps are
bottomless and only the Swampies know the paths. <br>
THAWN: And you'll get a spear in your back. They've killed two of my
men already. <br>
DUGEEN [OC]: Attention. Orbit shot in ten minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: Orbit shot? <br>
THAWN: Right, we'll watch it from the control centre. You come with us.

crate to the tribal leader.) <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Sixty calibre gas-operated Stelsons. <br>

ROHM-DUTT: Old? No, they need cleaning. Some of these guns have never
been out of their crates. They're in perfect working order. <br>
SKART: Where are the magazines? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: In there. Two for each gun. <br>
SKART: And spare ammunition? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: You have eighty magazines with fifty rounds in each. Is
there an army at the refinery? <br>
RANQUIN: You are my brother, and with these weapons we will drive the
dryfoots from our waters. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: That's why the Sons of Earth sent them. Oh now, Chief,
Chief, Chief, if you'd be kind enough to put your signature on this? <br>
SKART: Signature? What is this signature? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Well, make your mark or anything you like. Put your seal on
it. <br>
RANQUIN: The mark of Kroll is sacred to my people. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Oh. Oh, that will do very nicely. It's just to say that I've
made the delivery. <br>
SKART: We do not understand your dryfoot ways. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: I have to show them the paper back on Delta Magna. <br>
RANQUIN: Ah, I see, my brother. The Sons of Earth do not trust you, is
that it? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Well, it is business, Chief, you know. <br>
RANQUIN: Skart. <br>
(Skart takes the receipt and marks it with the end of a long ceremonial
spear, then hands it back.) <br>
RANQUIN: Now, what of the dryfoot woman that you captured? Was she
spying on you? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Oh, thank you, thank you. No, she's stubborn. She admits
nothing. <br>
SKART: Ranquin, let us offer her to the Great One. Always in the past,
before our people went into battle, we made a blood sacrifice to Kroll,
our protector. <br>
RANQUIN: We will sacrifice the dryfoot woman that we may triumph over
her kin. </font></p>

drinks.) <br>
THAWN: We produce a hundred tons of compressed protein a day and then
shoot it into Delta orbit every twelve hours. <br>
FENNER: That's what makes the operation viable. If we used freighters
it wouldn't be a commercial proposition. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
THAWN: Of course, the plant is fully automated. The computer controls
the orbit shot, but we like to double check. <br>
DOCTOR: Very sensible. <br>
FENNER: If there's a misfire then we have a manual override system. <br>
DOCTOR: And just the six of you here? <br>
THAWN: No, five. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, I make it six. One, two, three <br>
THAWN: Oh, you're counting Mensch. He's a Swampie. <br>
DOCTOR: Doesn't he count? <br>
THAWN: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Why are his friends attacking you? <br>
THAWN: Because they're ignorant savages. <br>
DUGEEN: They were the first on Delta Magna. <br>
FENNER: I don't think we owe them very much for that. <br>
DUGEEN: We took their planet. Now they're afraid we'll take what
they've got left. <br>
FENNER: You know there are times, Dugeen, that I think the Sons of
Earth have got at you. <br>
HARG: Two minutes to shot. <br>
DUGEEN: When we put ten full scale refineries in here, there'll be no
room for the natives and they know it. <br>
DOCTOR: In any case, a lake that size couldn't possibly support ten
full scale refineries. <br>
FENNER: It can. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Then you must have an alternative source of methane
feedstock. <br>
FENNER: We have calculated the methane production. We can satisfy the
protein requirements of one fifth of Delta Magna. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Tell me, where were your men when they were killed? <br>
THAWN: Why do you ask? <br>
DOCTOR: What? Oh, I don't know. Just curious. <br>
THAWN: Out in the baygule, taking samples. <br>
HARG: One minute to shot. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened? <br>
THAWN: We never found the bodies. The Swampies made quite sure of that.
<br>
DOCTOR: Then they might just have been drowned. <br>
THAWN: They were experienced men. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, anyone can make a mistake. <br>
HARG: Thirty seconds to shot. <br>
THAWN: Don't you worry about the Swampies. We'll look after them,
provided they see reason. <br>
DOCTOR: What, teach them to carry trays? <br>
FENNER: Why not? Tell me, would you let a small band of semi-savages
stand in the way of progress? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, progress is a very flexible word. It can mean just about
anything you want it to mean. <br>

MENSCH: My people are calling Kroll. They're making a blood sacrifice. <br>
DOCTOR: Who's Kroll? <br>
THAWN: Oh, it's their name for a giant squid. Centuries ago, when we
resettled the Swampies from Delta Magna, we shipped along a couple of
specimens just to keep them happy. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but just the same, a blood sacrifice. I don't like the
sound of that. <br>
THAWN: Don't be stupid. You'll never cross those swamps on your own. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Look, I have a shrewd idea who it is that might be being
sacrificed, and Romana's not the easiest of guests. <br>
THAWN: It'll be light in one hour, so we'll take a swamp glider and go
in force. <br>
DOCTOR: There's no need for you to be involved. <br>
THAWN: You heard Mensch. If they're sacrificing, they're preparing for
war, and that means Rohm-Dutt has got through with the guns. We've got
gas mortars, so we could knock out that settlement in a couple of
minutes. Now that we know they're armed, we can prove that we were

years ago. He must be dead by now. <br>

planning to attack us at dawn. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: What, to attack us? You mean here in the settlement? <br>
RANQUIN: They are coming in their air boats. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: But that wasn't what. You'll have to leave here at once. Get
your people to hide out in the swamps. <br>
RANQUIN: We are not running from the dryfoots. We have weapons now. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: But you don't know how to use them. <br>
VARLIK: A rifle's not a difficult weapon. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: You have to know one end from the other, Varlik. <br>
VARLIK: Like all dryfoots, Rohm-Dutt, because we lead a simple life you
think we're fools. <br>
ROHM-DUTT: All I'm saying is that you're not ready to fight yet, and if
you stay here, you'll get trapped and stand no chance. But if you split

never hit you. <br>

ambush them on the lakes, in the open. <br>

ROHM-DUTT: Chief, Chief, even if you succeed, it won't be the end. <br>

no right here. And there are many on Delta Magna who support our cause.

the swamp in the dark, would it not. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, but about our monster? He's liable to be back at any

DOCTOR: I don't think so. They're more likely to be digging trenches. <br>

were so busy trying to find an excuse to start a massacre, I just
slipped away. <br>
ROMANA: What is this refinery? They keep accusing me of coming from it.
<br>
DOCTOR: It's a primitive methane catalysing refinery. A pilot plant for
bigger things, they hope. <br>
ROMANA: Who's they? <br>
DOCTOR: The Earth colonists from Delta Magna. They're the ones who
shipped the little green men up here. <br>
ROMANA: Ah, because they thought this moon was no use to anybody. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. Of course, that was all a long time ago. <br>
ROMANA: And now they've found something here they want, they're trying
to get rid of them again. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. <br>
ROMANA: But methane? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I wouldn't have thought it was worthwhile, but they're
producing a hundred tons of compressed protein twice a day. <br>
ROMANA: As much as that? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, they're sending it back to Delta Magna in orbit shot
capsules. <br>
ROMANA: But it doesn't make sense. I mean, how can they possibly
produce that much protein? Where's it coming from? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, I haven't discovered that yet. But they're
producing it, and in sufficient quantities to make it worth fighting
over. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, this lot are spoiling for a war, too. The whole idea of
this sacrifice was to propitiate Kroll and get him on their side.
That's why I said it was political. And there's a gun-runner here
called Rohm-Dutt. He thinks I've been sent here to get evidence against
him. <br>
DOCTOR: Rohm-Dutt? So Thawn was right about the guns. I wonder. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, who's paying Rohm-Dutt? I mean, they obviously don't use
money here. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, does it matter? Let's just get out of here and find the

THAWN: Have you ever seen anything like this before? <br>
FENNER: No, I haven't. <br>
DUGEEN: It's on such a big scale. I doubt our mystery friend could
anything that size on his own. <br>
THAWN: If he is on his own. <br>
FENNER: Of course, when we picked him up he was talking about looking
for some friend. <br>
DUGEEN: Maybe there's more than one. We don't even know how he got
here. <br>
THAWN: Or how long he's been here. <br>
DUGEEN: Well, the only track of anything we picked up apart from your
own ship, was of whatever followed you down. <br>
FENNER: I think it's too much of a coincidence. You know we assumed it
was Rohm-Dutt's ship that had landed. We haven't found it, though, have
we. <br>
DUGEEN: It could have belonged to this fellow, I suppose. He's been
here with us, so he couldn't have done much by himself. But if he's got
friends out there, then we're in trouble. <br>
FENNER: So what are they up to? <br>
THAWN: Obvious, isn't it. They're trying to sabotage the plant. <br>
FENNER: Well, any activity on the lake bed could disturb the methane
source. <br>
THAWN: Of course. Now, I don't know where this fellow comes from, but
he's obviously got considerable scientific knowledge. <br>
DUGEEN: Look at the way he knew all about this plant. <br>
THAWN: Unless, of course, he was very well briefed. It could have been
an act. <br>
FENNER: No, no, no. Not when he was talking about inserting the plasmin
catalyst, no. <br>
THAWN: That's true. But whatever he is, I think that he's helping the
Swampies. You say one of the boats is missing? <br>
FENNER: Yeah. <br>
THAWN: Well, if he took a boat rather than a swamp glider, it means
that he doesn't want the noise of an engine. <br>
FENNER: It also means he's trying to cross the swamps on foot. <br>
DUGEEN: Why would he take that risk? <br>
THAWN: Because he's a Swampie-lover! I've told you, he's in with them. <br>
FENNER: You think he's gone to warn them that we're coming? <br>
THAWN: Exactly. I had an instinct about him from the very start. He was
too glib by half. Oh, yes, he's one of those fanatics from Sons of
Earth. <br>
FENNER: Well, they won't be much help to him, will they, when he starts
wandering off the path. <br>
THAWN: He can't have got very far, so I'll take Mensch and head him off

Bayeux tapestry with footnotes. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, a sort of Holy Writ. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's atrociously writ, but the pictures aren't bad.
Look. That shows them being evicted from Delta Magna. <br>

DOCTOR: That's right, yes. They were given this moon as a sort of
reservation. Look, there you are. There's Kroll in his aquarium. What
did I tell you? Sucker marks. <br>
ROMANA: What's the footnote? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Let me see. And Kroll. When Kroll awakened, he saw that
the people were fat and indolent, and then Kroll became angry and he
struck them down, swallowing into him the symbol of his power and
killing all who were in the temple, even Hajes the priest. Great was
the lamentation of the people but Kroll returned to the water and
slept. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I like a book with a happy ending. <br>
DOCTOR: Thus was the third manifestation of Kroll. Well, he's obviously

going to have someone imitate Kroll, it ought to be more convincing. <br>
RANQUIN: When the servants of Kroll appear in his guise, they are part

seen Kroll. You weren't even born at the time of the third

RANQUIN: What do you know of that, dryfoot? <br>
DOCTOR: I've read about it somewhere. <br>
RANQUIN: Kroll had the power of the Symbol. He sees all. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know Kroll has it now, but what was it? <br>
RANQUIN: The Symbol was a holy relic brought here by our ancestors at
the time of the settlement. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but what was the power? <br>
RANQUIN: He who holds the Symbol can see the future. The power revealed
how the dryfoots would destroy Delta Magna with their fighting and
their greed and the evil of their great cities. That is why my people
came to settle here. <br>
DOCTOR: Your people were evicted from their homeland, Ranquin. You had
no choice. <br>
RANQUIN: What do these questions matter to you who are already dying? <br>
DOCTOR: I like to get things straightened out. <br>

DOCTOR: And who do they think brought them? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: I told them the guns were sent by the Sons of Earth. Oh, I
got a signed receipt, too, for Thawn to use to discredit them. <br>
DOCTOR: Why the Sons of Earth? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: Do you have to keep asking questions at a time like this

DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, shush. Why did Thawn want to discredit the Sons
of Earth? <br>
ROHM-DUTT: They're a crank organisation. They support these primitives.
They want Thawn's company to pull out. <br>
ROMANA: Why do they call themselves the Sons of Earth? Not that I care
very much. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, that's a very good questions. After all, none
of them can ever have seen the Earth. <br>

FENNER: No, because it'd take at least eight hours for it to arrive. If
we showed them the target position now, it would certainly have moved
by the time the strike arrived. <br>
THAWN: Yeah, it would have to be a low intensity strike as well,
otherwise we should all get the blast. <br>
FENNER: These depth charges of yours. What if we packed them into a
separate tank, floated it over and then sank it when it was directly
over the creature? <br>
DUGEEN: How would you fire the depth charges? <br>
FENNER: Pressure detonators, that's easy enough. <br>
THAWN: Yes, but how would you sink the tank onto the right place? <br>
FENNER: Fix a small charge to the bottom of the tank and then fire it
by remote control. <br>
THAWN: But with pressure detonators, the whole lot would go up so
you're back to square one. <br>

(The Doctor and Romana go back down the passage.) <br>
DUGEEN: On moral grounds, sir. Look, if you fire that rocket, it's not
just the monster that'll die. You'll destroy a civilisation as old as
your own. <br>
THAWN: I don't count the Swampies as being civilised. You're talking
like one of those cranks from Sons of Earth. <br>
DUGEEN: They're not cranks. All life began on Mother Earth. All life is

came between us. <br>
RANQUIN: It was a test. The Great One was testing our faith. <br>

FENNER: He'd be alive now, wouldn't he, and I'm reporting you for

that abort panel. It was an act of sabotage. <br>
FENNER: He didn't like your methods. That did not make him a saboteur. <br>
THAWN: He was a plant from the Sons of Earth! It's obvious that he was
sent here to cripple this project any way that he could. <br>
FENNER: You don't kill a man because you suspect he belongs to the Sons
of Earth. <br>
THAWN: All right, Fenner. That will sound very good when we get back.

had swallowed it. <br>
