(The entrance to the colony is futuristic, A crowd is watching a drum
majorette perform to the accompaniment of a band. The whole place is
like a holiday camp, with everyone smiling and enjoying themselves.) <br>
PILOT: Oh, splendid! Splendid! You've got a very good band there,
Barney. <br>
BARNEY: Thank you, Pilot. <br>
PILOT: Mind you, I don't say you'll come first at the festival, but
never say die, what? Nothing succeeds like success. If at first you
don't succeed <br>
ALL: Try, try, try again! <br>
PILOT: That's right. <br>
OLA: Stop him! Don't let him get out! <br>
PILOT: What's the matter? Medok! <br>
MEDOK: Let me go! <br>
PILOT: This is very foolish of you, Medok. It's for your own good. <br>
MEDOK: Out of my way! <br>
OLA: He's far too dangerous to be allowed to escape. Get after him! You
should have stopped him. <br>
PILOT: What happened, Ola? <br>
OLA: He refused treatment in front of my guards so I dismissed them and
he made a dash for it. <br>
PILOT: Well, get after him. He must not get away.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ola and the guards chase Medok, who runs through
puddles and clambers over rocks to get away. He runs across some scrub
then hides behind rocks and waits for the guards to pass. Then the
Tardis materialises nearby. Medok eyes it suspiciously, and waits. The
Doctor, Ben, Polly and Jamie come out.) <br>
BEN: Hey! <br>
POLLY: Oh! Oh, Ben, for goodness sake. <br>
BEN: Well, what's the big stick for, Jamie? Nothing's happened yet. <br>
JAMIE: Have you no sense? Have you forgotten what we saw on that time
scanner? <br>
POLLY: Don't. It was horrible. <br>
JAMIE: Aye. Well, I'm not being left without nothing to defend
ourselves with. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you're wasting your time, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Unless I'm very much mistaken, these creatures are so big
they're going to see us long before we see them. <br>
POLLY: Look out, Jamie! <br>
BEN: Hang on, mate. I'll get him. <br>
(Medok throws himself at Jamie, but Ben and Jamie overpower him.) <br>
POLLY: Jamie! <br>
DOCTOR: Go on, Ben. <br>
POLLY: Sit on top of him, Ben. <br>
JAMIE: That's just a <br>
POLLY: Ben, are you all right? <br>
(Then Ola and his guards arrive.) <br>
OLA: We don't know who you are, strangers, but we are grateful. Medok
is one of our last patients in the Colony. We've done our best for him
but he gets worse day by day. I wasn't informed you were travelling
across our territory. Hurry back to the Colony and tell the Pilot
what's happened. <br>
BEN: Pilot? <br>
OLA: Yes, the Pilot of our Colony. No doubt he will want to thank you
in person. Tie him up tighter. Come on, tighter. I don't want any more
trouble with him. Come on, I'll show you myself. <br>
JAMIE: Er, any good asking? <br>
DOCTOR: Where we are? Well, according to my calculations we're
certainly in the future and on a planet very like the Earth. <br>
JAMIE: How do you know? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I'm guessing. <br>
OLA: My name is Ola. I am the Chief of Police. <br>
POLLY: That sounds very important. <br>
OLA: Oh, it's a very responsible job. I take my instructions from our
Control centre. Oh, it all works very well, as you will see. Please
follow me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. <br>
(He turns to the guards who are tying up Medok.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not too tight. It's bad for the blood pressure.

very like it, anyway.) <br>
OLA: Pilot, these are the strangers that have helped us. <br>
PILOT: Very well, Ola. I will look after our guests. You will no doubt
wish to take care of poor Medok. You may leave. Well, our thanks to you

as Medok. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it was nothing. Anyone would have done the same. Well
this is gay. Why all the music? <br>
PILOT: Oh, we regulate our day by music. And now, my friends, I suggest
you take advantage of our refreshing department. <br>

around the corner. <br>

wish to welcome our guests. <br>
PILOT: Oh, but of course. Switch on please, my dear. <br>
(A screen lights up with the static picture of a man.) <br>
POLLY: Hey, who's that? He looks smashing. <br>
PILOT: That's our Controller. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: We wish to welcome joyfully the visitors to our colony.
We are very grateful to them. They have performed a valuable service.
The Colony is to make our guests happy and contented during their stay.
Welcome again, friends. Now, back to work everyone. <br>
POLLY: Well, that was great. I'm really going to enjoy myself. <br>
PILOT: Splendid! And now, my good friends, let me put you into the
hands of our supervisor, Barney. Dear old Barney, everybody calls him. <br>
BARNEY: Thank you, Pilot. <br>
PILOT: And I must leave you for work calls, you know. And hard work
never hurt anybody. Till later. <br>
(Pilot leaves.) <br>
BARNEY: Delighted to see you. Delighted to have you with us. Now, you
have a complete choice of all our treatments. We have steam baths,
beauty treatments, perhaps a massage. You, sir, of course, would like
your clothes cleaned. And there's sunlight treatment, moonlight
treatment, sparkling and effervescent sprays. <br>
DOCTOR: I feel perfectly all right as I am, thank you. <br>
POLLY: Oh go on, Doctor. Don't be such a drag. It all looks super.
Please, may I have a shampoo? <br>
BARNEY: Shampoo, of course, for the young lady. <br>
POLLY: Thanks very much. <br>
BARNEY: And for the young gentlemen, our very latest treatment in our
cubicles over there. <br>
JAMIE: Me? Oh, hey, no, you're not going to do that to me. I'm no
lassie. <br>
BEN: It's no good, Jamie, the lassies have got you., And believe me
mate, I'm not going to struggle. <br>
(The boys are taken away by two young ladies.) <br>
BARNEY: And now, sir, for you. <br>
(Polly returns.) <br>
BARNEY: Oh, very nice. Very nice indeed. You must certainly be the most
beautiful young lady in our Colony, and are quite sure to be elected
our next beauty president. <br>
POLLY: Thank you very much. <br>
BARNEY: Oh, not at all. All part of our service. To your liking, sir? <br>
BEN: Ah, marvellous. Like being at anchor in the Med. <br>
BARNEY: Some protective oils for our guests and a little suntan. <br>
BEN: This the life. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, mister, would you call the ladies off? I'm frightened what
they might do to me. <br>
BARNEY: Oh, but you look charming, sir. Charming. <br>
JAMIE: That's what I'm frightened of. <br>
(The Doctor is in a strange machine. The lid opens to show his hair is
neat and flat now.) <br>
DOCTOR: Please get me out of here. I'm done to a turn. <br>
BARNEY: Clothes reviver. <br>
DOCTOR: My clothes don't need reviving. <br>
BARNEY: Oh, while we're about it, sir. And off. <br>
(The front of the machine opens. The Doctor comes out immaculately
groomed.) <br>
POLLY: Oh, Doctor. You look gorgeous. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my shoes! <br>
BEN: Oh, they're fantastic. You can see your face in them. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. Who wants to see their face in a pair of suede
shoes? What's this one? <br>
BARNEY: Oh, that, sir, is our rough and tumble machine, for toning up
the muscles. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly what I need. Full on! <br>
BARNEY: Oh, but no, sir! No! <br>
(General consternation.) <br>
POLLY: But your clothes! <br>
BEN: Get out. Oh, come out, Doctor. <br>
POLLY: Turn it off. Turn it off. <br>
BEN: Come out of it. <br>
POLLY: Come out of it, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I feel better. Oh, that's more like it. <br>
(He is back to his previous rumpled self. Jamie enters.) <br>
POLLY: Oh, you look smashing. You really do. You look like a prince.
Jamie, that's super. It really is.

trusted. He's violent and suffering from delusions. <br>
MEDOK: I'm not the one suffering from delusions, it's you. All of you!
You don't know what's happening in this Colony. <br>
OLA: Be quiet, Medok. <br>
MEDOK: There's only one way to silence me, Ola. <br>
QUESTA: Medok, old fellow, it's Questa. Remember me? What's happened to
you? <br>
OLA: It's no good. You can't reason with him. <br>
QUESTA: Just a minute. He's an old friend. One of the best. <br>
OLA: Ha! <br>
QUESTA: He's as cheerful as any of us. Medok, what's happened to you?
What's all this about you seeing things? <br>
MEDOK: I don't see things, Questa, you fool. There are things. Horrible
things. Creatures infesting this camp at night. <br>
OLA: That's enough. Have you seen the Pilot? <br>
QUESTA: He's with the strangers. I've no idea where they are. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Back to work. Shift rest is over. No time to be lost. The
Colony needs you. Preparation to be made for tonight's reception, a
welcome for the strangers. <br>
QUESTA: A reception tonight. A Colony party! Medok, join in with the
rest of us, like you used to. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: It will be fun for all! <br>

MEDOK: All right! Have fun while you can, before they crawl all over

to pick the lock. A young woman approaches.) <br>
CHICKI: Can I help you? <br>

DOCTOR: I'm going to set you free. Just hold still a minute. There we
are. One more. Don't bother to say thank you. Now, tell me something
about these things that you see. Do they, for instance, appear to crawl
slowly over the ground? <br>
MEDOK: How do you know? <br>

OLA: Stop him! Don't let him escape! <br>
PILOT: How did he get away? Who's responsible? What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: I told him he wouldn't get hurt and he wouldn't believe me. <br>
PILOT: You mean you let him go? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no, not exactly. <br>
OLA: He let the prisoner escape. That is a crime in this Colony. For
that men must work in the pit. Guards! <br>
POLLY: You can't touch him. He doesn't know your laws. <br>
PILOT: That's true, Ola. He is a stranger here. <br>
DOCTOR: There's something else you forgetting, gentlemen. I set free
someone that we caught in the first place. <br>
PILOT: True. A reasonable point of view, Ola. <br>
OLA: Medok is dangerous. He should have never let him go. The Colony
will be petrified when they know he's out there in the night. <br>
PILOT: Well, send your patrol after him. He can't have got far. <br>
DOCTOR: He can run, you know. He's got legs. He doesn't have to crawl
over the ground. <br>
OLA: Why do you say that? <br>
DOCTOR: No reason. No reason at all. <br>
OLA: Anyone who spreads that kind of rumour in this Colony will find
himself in the hospital for correction. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, that's where Medok lives, is it? <br>
PILOT: I think, Doctor, you will understand more about Medok if you
talk to some of the people who knew him best. <br>
OLA: Pilot, I think <br>

something about us. Pete, go with him. <br>

There is no need for alarm. You may all continue your work and play

PILOT: You don't seem to realise how serious this business is, Doctor.
You have committed a crime. <br>
DOCTOR: A crime? <br>
PILOT: What were you doing with Medok? You know he's a dangerous man. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not so sure, Pilot. <br>
PILOT: You have already been told. He has refused to cooperate and to
obey orders. He suffers from hallucinations. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the point. Does he? <br>
PILOT: What exactly do you mean by that? <br>
DOCTOR: Let me perhaps explain. <br>

interrupted. <br>

PILOT: Oh, very well. Bring him in. <br>
DOCTOR: I hope you're not going to listen to everything that Medok
tells you? <br>
PILOT: Why, Doctor? Are you afraid of something he might say? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, in his state of mind he might say anything. <br>
(Ola and Medok enter.) <br>
MEDOK: Doctor. How have they been treating you? <br>
OLA: Silence. <br>
DOCTOR: Perfectly all right, thank you. <br>
OLA: Medok's made a further statement, Pilot. It's about the Doctor. <br>
PILOT: Ah. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
PILOT: Yes, Medok? <br>
MEDOK: The Doctor wasn't helping me. He was trying to make me give
myself up. <br>
PILOT: Well, that was extremely brave. Why didn't you tell us this? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, as a matter of fact <br>
MEDOK: Captain Ola didn't give him a chance. <br>
PILOT: I see. Well, it seems we owe you an apology, Doctor. <br>
MEDOK: It's better we tell the truth, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you, Medok. I quite understand. <br>
PILOT: Take him away. <br>
OLA: Come on, Medok. <br>
(Ola and Medok.) <br>
PILOT: Well, I'm extremely sorry about it, Doctor, and of course you're
free to go. <br>
DOCTOR: What will happen to Medok? <br>
PILOT: Oh, well, he'll be taken back to the hospital for correction.
He'll be given another course of treatment. And when he returns to the
Colony, Medok will be a changed man. He will cooperate and he will obey
orders. He'll be just like the rest of us. <br>
DOCTOR: Why do you want everyone to be the same? <br>
PILOT: Doctor, this Colony was founded many centuries ago by our
ancestors who came from the Earth planet, like your young friends. Our
ancestors believed in the virtues of healthy happiness and we have
tried to keep their ideals alive. Sometimes, alas, it is necessary to
use force. (into intercom) The Doctor will be returning to his quarters
now. <br>
VOICE [OC]: The Doctor's escort is ready. <br>
PILOT: Well, I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Doctor, and many thanks
again for your help. <br>
DOCTOR: Not at all. Thank you. Goodnight. <br>

PILOT: Oh, I'm so sorry. Goodnight. <br>

Controller.) <br>
CONTROL [OC]: The Doctor and his friends are to be given the advantage
of high powered adaption at once. They must begin to think like members
of the Colony. They are to have deep sleep and thinking patterns. We
cannot have criticism from these strangers! The work to do it, it must
begin immediately. <br>
PILOT: Emergency order from Control, top priority. Are all the cubicles
connected? <br>
VOICE [OC]: The rest cubicles for the four strangers are all connected
for deep sleep and thought patterns. <br>
PILOT: Very good. The process is to begin immediately. Your
instructions are being carried out. <br>

Colony. <br>
DOCTOR: And you're one of them, I'd say. <br>
PILOT: Naturally. And you're not asking me to believe that in a few
moments you have been able to work out a formula which it has taken our
combined computers years to perfect? <br>
DOCTOR: It does seem rather a tall order. <br>
PILOT: Yes, of course. I know what you've done. You've broken into our
secret files, haven't you? <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't know how to do that. Take a look. <br>
PILOT: Well, you must have seen the document. That's the exact
computation. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Huh. In that case <br>
(He alters his mark to eleven out of ten.) <br>
PILOT: Do you really mean to say that you worked that out by yourself? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I did have a little assistance. <br>
PILOT: Yes, I thought so. Who was it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. No person. No. I simply mean that I
took readings from the various dials. They appeared to be related, so I
worked out the principle that controlled them. It was simple really.
Like doing a sum backwards. <br>
PILOT: Backwards? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. You know. Given the answer, what's the question? <br>
PILOT: Wipe it away. Get it off there before anybody else sees it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, if you insist. <br>
(The Doctor throws a bucket of water at the wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there now. If anyone follows that formula there'll be an
almighty explosion. X to the power of y is derivative 2 3's of 6! <br>

POLLY: They're in the control room. It must be like getting into the
brain, mustn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, very likely. <br>
POLLY: Shh. They might hear you. <br>
DOCTOR: Now then. One system must provide them with the gas they need,
and the other one must be an outflow. <br>
POLLY: Doctor, we've got to bring the Pilot here, and then we can show
him these creatures really do exist. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Polly. I think it might work.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OLA: (to Jamie) Look at me when I talk to you. <br>
PILOT: Ola, a word with you. Where exactly did you catch him? <br>
OLA: In here. In the hall, Pilot. <br>
PILOT: I see. So in fact, he gave himself up? <br>
OLA: He should never have been allowed to escape. <br>
PILOT: Are you criticising Control? <br>
OLA: I'm criticising the running of the pits. <br>
PILOT: But that is my job, Ola. <br>
OLA: I know that. But were it not for my guards, this stranger would
still be a danger to all of us. I am going to report to Control that
there is no discipline in the pits. <br>
PILOT: That's not the only report Control will get! <br>
OLA: Ever since these strangers arrived your authority in this Colony
has gone to pieces. They come and go as they please, and even now two
of them are still missing. <br>
DOCTOR: Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Well, everyone is up
bright and early. And the last two strangers are not missing after all.
Oh, come now. We can't have bad temper and differences of opinion in
this happy type colony. Say you're sorry, Ola. Say you're sorry, Pilot.
<br>
JAMIE: Doctor, what did ye come here for? You've walked into a trap. <br>
DOCTOR: Good morning, Jamie. It's nice to see you so well cared for. <br>
JAMIE: Yes, but Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all right. I've just come in to have a word with my
old friend, the Pilot. Good morning, Ben. I hope you're feeling more
your old self? <br>
BEN: Yes, Doctor. I am. <br>
PILOT: Why did not your guards arrest these strangers? <br>
OLA: I don't know. Guards, arrest them. <br>
PILOT: That is no longer necessary. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course not. You can't arrest us now we've given ourselves
up. That's against the rules. <br>
PILOT: Now. You wish to see me? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, urgently. Come with me. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: This is Control. Everyone is to return to work
immediately. This order includes all executives. It includes the Pilot.
Everyone back to work immediately. <br>
PILOT: Well, I shall have to go. <br>
POLLY: No, wait. You must listen to what the Doctor's got to tell you.
They're only saying that because they know what we've seen. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: At once! <br>
DOCTOR: Pilot. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: At once! That is an order! <br>
POLLY: Don't take any notice of them. That's not your Controller. Those
are your enemies. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: There must be no discussion with the strangers! <br>
POLLY: Why not? <br>
JAMIE: Aye, what are you afraid of? <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Arrest the strangers! That is an order! All the
strangers! <br>
BEN: That doesn't sound like a man in control. <br>
PILOT: What did you wish to tell me? <br>
OLA: Pilot, you heard Control. Guards, take them all away. <br>
PILOT: I am still the Pilot here. You will take your orders from me.
Get back to your quarters. <br>
OLA: Contact Control immediately. Report the Pilot! <br>
DOCTOR: That was a very brave thing to do. <br>
PILOT: Or very foolish. What is it you wanted to tell me? <br>
DOCTOR: Come with me. <br>
OLA: Pilot! <br>
PILOT: You will all remain here. <br>
BEN: He disobeyed Control. The Pilot will be arrested. <br>
JAMIE: No. <br>
POLLY: Anything may happen now, Jamie. We've got to be ready to run for
it. <br>
JAMIE: We can't leave the Doctor. <br>
POLLY: He'll be back in a minute, and Ben seems to be all right now. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, more like the old Ben, I must admit. But you still canna.
Where is he?

the Doctor and Pilot.)
PILOT: But, Doctor, this is forbidden territory. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes and you'll soon see why. <br>
PILOT: Stop! Stop! You're breaking the law! <br>
DOCTOR: Bad laws were made to be broken. Follow me. <br>
PILOT: But <br>
(The Doctor and Pilot go into the Pipe room) <br>
OFFICIA: What's happened to the Pilot, Ola? The strangers have changed
him! <br>
OLA: The Pilot is a traitor. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, perhaps I've got an honest face. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: The Pilot is to be arrested! This is a happy Colony! All
must obey! <br>
PILOT: Did you hear that? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't give up now. It's just up here. <br>
(The Doctor and Pilot climb the ladder.) <br>
CONTROL [OC]: All guards to report to the pit head. They are to take
orders from Ola. Is this understood? <br>
(The Doctor and Pilot look through the port hole into the Control room
full of Macra.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you are. That's what's taken over this Colony. You
haven't been in touch with Control, but with these. They've used this
Colony for their own ends, destroying you to live themselves. <br>
PILOT: Why, they're horrible. No, Doctor. It is they who must be
destroyed. We must kill them. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: They're here! <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: The Pilot and the stranger! In forbidden territory! They
must be destroyed! <br>
PILOT: What are they, Doctor? I mean, some monstrous form of bacteria?
Insects? Or what? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but you must fight them. <br>
PILOT: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Take full command! <br>
PILOT: You mean defy Control? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you see what Control really is. <br>
PILOT: Yes. You're right, Doctor. They must be destroyed.

OLA: You know what happens to people that say that. <br>
PILOT: But I <br>
OLA: Now we can deal with you all together. <br>
POLLY: Did the Pilot has see them? <br>
PILOT: Yes, I saw the Macra. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: It is forbidden to say that. Don't let him say that he
has seen Macra! <br>
PILOT: I saw you! You are the Macra! <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Silence! Silence the three strangers! That is an order! <br>
OLA: What shall we do with them, Control? <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Return them to the pipe room. The three strangers and the
Pilot. They are to be locked in, and you will not let them out. <br>
OLA: Come on, get in. <br>
PILOT: Ola. <br>
POLLY: Doctor! <br>
OLA: Come on, you heard Control. Get in. <br>

OLA: What instructions, Control? <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Clear the building. Guards and workers are to return to
the hall for music. <br>
OLA: I obey, Control. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: It will take precisely four minutes, and then it will be
safe for everyone to return to work. Four minutes. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Pilot, do you know where it's coming from? <br>
PILOT: Why, no. I've never been here before. <br>
DOCTOR: There must be a hidden inlet. <br>
