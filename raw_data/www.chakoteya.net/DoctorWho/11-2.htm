<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Welcome to an eerily quiet London. The Albert
Embankment, the Cenotaph, Trafalgar Square, the West End, Old
Billingsgate, Smithfield, everywhere that there is usually humanity
moving all hours of the day or night are empty. A dog sniffs around a
car where the driver's door has been left open. A milk float is
abandoned, with a smashed milk bottle and the money bag lying on the
pavement. Children's toys are left alone in the grass. The quiet is
shattered by the Tardis materialising.) <br>
SARAH: It seems to be all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I told you I'd get you back home safely, didn't I? <br>
SARAH: We set off from the Research Centre. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's no point in going back there. No, I set course
for UNIT HQ. <br>
SARAH: Well, this isn't UNIT HQ. <br>
DOCTOR: The space time coordinates were a bit out, that's all. We can't
be far away. <br>
SARAH: So where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Somewhere in London. <br>
SARAH: And when? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, when we left. Give or take a few weeks. <br>
SARAH: It's not the nineteenth century or the twenty first? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Sarah, you are perfectly safe. Now all we've got to do
now is go and find a telephone and ring the Brigadier. <br>
(The sound of a tree crashing to the ground.) <br>
SARAH: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the parks department's cutting down some trees. Come on. <br>
(Behind the Tardis are two deckchairs, one knocked over.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[A London road]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor finds a public telephone box but can't
get a dialing tone.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't work. <br>
SARAH: It's probably been vandalised. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a very unfair word, you know, because actually the
Vandals were quite decent chaps. Come on, let's see if we can go and
find a taxi. <br>
SARAH: Some hopes. Well, there's a bus stop. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(There is life somewhere. A man comes down the fire escape of a large
building, but ducks out of sight when a Land Rover comes round the
corner with armed troops in it. Once it has gone past, the man hurries
down to his own car, throws a bag onto the passenger seat and drives
off.) <br>
SARAH: There's no bus. <br>
DOCTOR: There's no anything. No, nothing's moving. No bicycles, no
pedestrians, no cars, nothing. <br>
SARAH: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps it's Sunday. Great Britain always closes on
Sundays. Come on, I think we'd better walk. <br>
(The man in the car appears, but doesn't slow down when they gesture
for a lift. In fact, he nearly hits them.) <br>
SARAH: Charming! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps he doesn't like hitch-hikers.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The car pulls up outside a parade of shops in
Moorfields and the driver gets out, taking his bag with him. The Doctor
and Sarah arrive, and see the car with its passenger door left open.
They investigate. The man is inside looking over some chains and other
jewellery when he looks up and hides. The Doctor and Sarah enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: Anybody here? <br>
SARAH: Look. <br>
(Sarah has spotted the bag on the counter. The man appears holding a
sawn off shotgun.) <br>
PHILLIPS: I got here first. Turn round. Hands against that wall. <br>
DOCTOR: Do as he says, Sarah. Sarah, do as he says! Look, I realise
that you're very busy, but would you mind telling me what's going on
around here? <br>
PHILLIPS: You find your own places. There's plenty to choose from. I
got here first. <br>
(Phillips runs out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah, no! He's liable to shoot you out of pure terror. <br>
SARAH: I'll call the police. <br>
(Phillips drives away. Sarah dials 999.) <br>
SARAH: They're not answering. <br>
(Outside is a screech of tyres and a deep roar. The Doctor and Sarah
run out to see the car looking as if it had wrapped itself around a
concrete pillar, but there is nothing in sight that it could have hit.
Phillips lies dead on the pavement.)

OGDEN: Right, okay, got it. Sarge? Another sighting. <br>
BENTON: Thank you, Ogden. <br>
(Benton marks it on a map while the Brigadier talks on a telephone.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, that's right. Frequency of sightings about the same.
There's not much we can do, sir, except plot them. No, sir, the Doctor
isn't back yet. I'm hoping he'll return very soon. Yes, all right. Yes,
all right, sir, I'll keep you informed. Goodbye. <br>
YATES: Yes, got that. Thank you. Sir? Five more looters have been
picked up in Hyde Park. <br>
BRIGADIER: Ogden. Get this off to General Finch, will you? <br>
OGDEN: Sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: I've asked the regulars for more men. We've got to get more
patrols out. <br>
YATES: It's organised gangs now, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: What? <br>
YATES: The looters. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, it's only to be expected. <br>
YATES: We're going to need more detention centres. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, all right, Yates. Get them set up! The looters are a
detail. It's these we've got to worry about.

carrying Phillips' bag of loot.) <br>
SARAH: There must be somebody somewhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. <br>
SARAH: Over there. <br>
(A Land Rover drives past the end of the road.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's stopping. Come on. <br>
(The Land Rover reverses into a mews garage, and the doors shut before
the Doctor and Sarah arrive.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Sarah enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello? Hello? <br>
(Two men drop something and hide, then one reappears holding an iron
bar. The Doctor easily deals with him, but the second man hits him over
the head then throws off Sarah. Outside there is automatic weapon fire.
The two men get up and run out. Sarah goes to help the Doctor.) <br>
SARAH: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Not really, no. Help me up, will you? <br>
(Vehicles drive past outside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's an ill wind. At least we've got some transport. Open
that door, Sarah, will you? <br>
(The Doctor puts Phillips' bag into the Land Rover as Sarah tries the
garage doors.) <br>
SARAH: They're jammed. <br>
(Something screeches nearby and what looks like a small pterodactyl
glides down the stairs and buzzes Sarah and the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Get out! Come on, in the back! <br>
(The Doctor throws a sack at the flying lizard, which gets caught it
its claws. They get into the Land Rover and it smashes the drivers
window with its long toothed beak. The Doctor fights it off, gets the
Land Rover started and smashes through the doors. Registration 20DM58 -
must be military.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, sir, I can't agree to that. <br>
FINCH: I'm giving you a direct order, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: With respect, sir, I cannot and will not allow troops under
my command to open fire upon civilians. <br>
FINCH: These civilians are looters, and central London is under martial
law. <br>
BRIGADIER: What's happening is deplorable, sir, but may I remind you
that looters are not our main problem? Shortage of observation patrols
is. <br>
FINCH: The army has been stretched to its limits with the evacuation of
eight million people. <br>
BRIGADIER: The evacuation is now complete, sir. <br>
FINCH: For you, perhaps, but not for us. All these wretched people have
to be fed, sheltered, cared for. <br>
BRIGADIER: But the front line's here, sir, in central London. It's more
important to find the cause of this crisis than to deal with its
effects. <br>
FINCH: All right, but what are you doing about it? <br>
BRIGADIER: Plotting the incidents as they occur and searching London to
find their cause. <br>
FINCH: And waiting for this mysterious scientific advisor of yours to
turn up? <br>
BRIGADIER: That's right, sir. <br>
FINCH: Hmm. I suppose he'll just materialise out of thin air. <br>
BRIGADIER: Very probably. <br>
FINCH: Very well. But while we're waiting for this Doctor of yours, you
will obey my orders. You can have your extra patrols, Brigadier, but my
instructions to them are that any looter who does not surrender
immediately will be shot.

Doctor and Sarah drive in and get out of the Land Rover.) <br>
NORTON: Halt! Place your hands above your head! <br>
(The Corporal in charge fires into the air.) <br>
NORTON: That will be your only warning. Raise your hands! <br>
(The Doctor and Sarah obey.) <br>
DOCTOR: Will you please tell me what's happening? <br>
NORTON: Over there by the Land Rover. Turn round, lean forward, hands
against the side. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, will you please tell me what's going on here? <br>
NORTON: Turn round! Search their vehicle. <br>
(Norton frisks the Doctor and Sarah while his patrol find the holdall
and a pile of fur coats in the Land Rover.) <br>

denim jacket.) <br>
DUFFY: Right. You were arrested today, found looting in possession of
two tape recorders, one radio and a colour television set. You will be
held for military trial. Photographs. <br>
(A soldier takes the man away.) <br>
DUFFY: Next. Names? <br>
DOCTOR: Now, if I can have a word with someone in authority. <br>
DUFFY: Names. <br>
SARAH: Sarah Jane Smith. <br>
DUFFY: Name? <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor John Smith. No relation. <br>

DUFFY: Offence? <br>
NORTON: Looting furs, jewels and money. <br>
DUFFY: Right. You'll be held for military trial. Over there for
photographs. <br>
SARAH: But why are the military running everything? <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Sarah. Let's go and have our photos taken, shall we? <br>
(They cross the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, deary me, that's very antiquated equipment, isn't it? I'll
think you'll find that the right is my best side. <br>
NORTON: Shut up and hold that in front of you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, all right. <br>
(Prisoner 177781 smiles for his mug shots.) <br>
NORTON: Now you. <br>
SARAH: Thank you. <br>
( Prisoner 177782 also smiles for her pictures.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, what about one of both of us? Come and join in. <br>
NORTON: Over there. Down there. On the floor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, we'd rather stand, if you don't mind. <br>
NORTON: Sit down! <br>
(Sarah nods towards something behind them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! What a good idea. There we are. <br>
(The Doctor takes a couple of folding chairs from the pile.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's better. <br>
NORTON: Keep them quiet. <br>
PRIVATE: All right. <br>
SARAH: What do we do now? <br>
DOCTOR: Wait for the officer to turn up. Maybe we can get some sense
out of him. <br>
SARAH: What on Earth's going on? What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: I've no idea. Maybe this gentleman here can enlighten us. <br>
(The man in the denim jacket is sitting on the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do, sir? I'm the Doctor. <br>
LODGE: You've got nothing to be cheerful about. There's no judge and
jury now, mate. Military law. <br>
SARAH: But why? <br>
LODGE: Where you been? Because of the monsters!

large with equally big teeth smashes through it. A soldier reports in

SOLDIER: It's coming straight for us, sir, and we're trapped. Same as
usual. The bullets won't do any good. We're going to try and turn it
with the grenades. <br>

sight, the R/T reception's diabolical. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm well aware of that. <br>
BENTON: Yes, sir, but there must be some connection. Whatever's causing
the monsters is causing the interference. <br>
BRIGADIER: The thought had occurred to me, Benton, but since we don't
know what's causing either we're not really much the wiser. <br>
(A soldier puts a folder on a desk and the Brigadier picks it up.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Latest batch of looters. File them. <br>
BENTON: Right, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Huh. Another message from the government here telling us to
make sure that law and order's maintained in the evacuative zone. They
seem to have forgotten the main problem. <br>
BENTON: Yes, well, it's all right for them, stuck safe and sound up in
Harrogate. What a scruffy looking bunch we've got here. <br>
SOLDIER: You can say that again. <br>
BENTON: Hey, sir, look. <br>
BRIGADIER: What? <br>
(Benton hands over a mug shot.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Good grief. Looter charged with stolen furs, jewellery and
money. <br>
BENTON: And there's one of that journalist girl, Sarah Jane Smith. <br>
BRIGADIER: They're being held at number five reception centre. Ogden,
number five reception. Get them on the R/T, will you? <br>
OGDEN: No good, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, all right, I'll go there myself. Get my jeep, will you? <br>
BENTON: There's a planning conference for General Finch in ten minutes,
sir. Well, shall I go? <br>
BRIGADIER: No, you'd better stay here. Send a dispatch rider and get
them brought here as quickly as possible. <br>

recorders, one radio and a colour television set. <br>
SHEARS: Anything to say? <br>
LODGE: Well, yes. I, er, found the stuff, see. I was going to hand it
in. <br>
SHEARS: You've been found guilty of looting. Under the authority vested
in me by the Emergency Powers Act, I'm issuing an order that you be
held in a military detention centre for the duration of the emergency.
You'll be handed over to the civil authorities for trial and sentence

DOCTOR: Because those soldiers were talking about the central zone,
weren't they. <br>
SARAH: But where did that monster come from? <br>

somewhere, and somehow or other it hatched out? <br>
DOCTOR: What, producing a sweet little baby monster? <br>

noticing. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: It all started just after you, Doctor,
and as we later discovered, Miss Smith, went off on your last little
jaunt. <br>
SARAH: We were helping you, and if you knew what we'd been through. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, some other time, Miss Smith, if you don't mind? <br>
BRIGADIER: A variety of prehistoric reptiles began to appear in the
central London area. There was, as you can imagine, considerable panic
and some loss of life. <br>
(The Doctor finds a bag of sugar and puts four heaped teaspoons into
his mug of tea.) <br>
DOCTOR: How many of these things have been seen up to now? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, the pins record the sighting <br>
BENTON: It's a colour code, Doctor. We're using red pins for
Tyrannosaurus, blue for Triceratops, green for the Stegosaurus and pink
for your actual Pterodactyl. <br>
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Benton. We soon realised that these creatures
only appear in central London. We therefore evacuated the entire area
and set up this temporary HQ, which as you can see from the map, is on
the periphery of the zone. <br>
SARAH: You've evacuated everybody? <br>
BRIGADIER: Eight million people. I'm happy to say the evacuation was
carried out without a hitch. Of course the criminal element has been
taking advantage of the situation. <br>
SARAH: Looters, you mean. Like those people we met. <br>
BRIGADIER: There's been quite a bit of that, I'm afraid. But we're
keeping them under control. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's absolutely marvellous, Brigadier. Now what're you
doing about the real problem? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, as soon as these creatures appear, we make sure that
they're contained within the evacuated zone, and don't wander off into
populated areas. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, having contained them, what do you do then? <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah, well, that's where you come in, Doctor. So far we've
absolutely no idea where they're coming from or come to that, where
they go. <br>
SARAH: Where they go? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, that's one of the few good things about the entire
situation. According to my patrols, they seem to vanish. Just
disappear. No one sees them come, no one sees them go. <br>
SARAH: But things that size, where could they go? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's pretty obvious, isn't it, Sarah? <br>
SARAH: Hmm? <br>
DOCTOR: Back where they came from, into the past. <br>
(Finch and Yates enter.) <br>
FINCH: All right, Brigadier, you can have your extra patrols, but I
warn you, I shall expect results. <br>
DOCTOR: Mike, my dear fellow, how are you? Good to see you again. <br>
YATES: Doctor. <br>
FINCH: Who's this? <br>
BRIGADIER: Sir, this is the Doctor, our scientific advisor. <br>
FINCH: Oh. We've been waiting for you, you know. May I ask where you've
been? <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly. <br>
FINCH: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: You can ask but I don't guarantee that you'll get a reply. <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, this is General Finch. He's in overall charge of the
entire operation. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, is he indeed. How do you do, General. <br>
BRIGADIER: The Doctor's already come up with a most interesting theory,
sir. He believes these creatures are coming to us from the past. <br>
FINCH: Huh. Very interesting. How? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, um. Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Somebody or something is operating a temporal displacement on a
very vast scale. <br>
FINCH: Never mind your scientific gobbledygook. <br>
DOCTOR: The creatures are being brought from the past into the present,
General, staying here for a while and then returning to their own time.
<br>
FINCH: Rubbish! <br>
DOCTOR: I take it then that you have a better theory. <br>
FINCH: Yes. Some mad scientist fellow has been secretly breeding these
things. Now they've all got away. <br>
SARAH: Ah, no, General, now I thought that, but if you think about it <br>
FINCH: Who's this? <br>
SARAH: Oh. Sarah Jane Smith. How do you do? <br>
FINCH: (to Yates) Civilians are not allowed in this zone. Have her
evacuated immediately. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, Miss Smith is presently acting as my assistant, General.
You were saying, my dear? <br>
SARAH: We have just met a man from the past. A peasant from the age of
King John. No, honestly, General, it's true. <br>
FINCH: I'm not staying here to listen to this rubbish. <br>
YATES: I think you'll find it is worth listening to the Doctor, sir.
He's given us a great deal of help in the past. <br>
OGDEN: Okay, out. Sergeant? Another sighting. <br>
BENTON: Oh, thank you, Ogden. <br>

BRIGADIER: Sir. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll do no such thing, Brigadier. <br>
FINCH: I'll thank you to stop interfering <br>

BRIGADIER: Well, not exactly. <br>
DOCTOR: The Brigadier and his men couldn't see what happened, sir. They
were temporally affected by a time eddy. <br>
FINCH: A what? <br>
DOCTOR: Whenever a creature appears or disappears, the temporal
displacement causes a localised distortion in time. Now as far as the
people in the immediate vicinity were concerned, time literally runs
backwards, so naturally, they'd have no recollection of what had
occurred. <br>
FINCH: The man's mad. Temporal displacement. Time travel is impossible,
we all know that. <br>

lead me to the source. <br>
YATES: It couldn't be a natural phenomenon, could it, Doctor? Something
going wrong with time? <br>

reptiles existed all over the planet, Mike. They'd be popping up
everywhere. <br>
SARAH: Doctor, what about that man we saw in the garage? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think he was an accident. Whoever's responsible for
these apparitions, General, is operating from somewhere in this area. <br>

evacuated. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, of course. Er, let's see now, there was this this
Chinese scientist called Chun Sen. Oh, hang about, he hasn't been born
yet, has he. <br>
SARAH: Quite, but there is a man called Whitaker. Now he's the leading
scientist in this field. <br>
BRIGADIER: Whitaker. That name rings a bell. <br>
SARAH: He claimed to have developed a workable theory of time travel. <br>
BRIGADIER: I remember. He applied for a big government grant. It was
refused. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, why? <br>
SARAH: Whitaker was always an outsider, always mixed up in quarrels
with other scientists. No one believed his theory would work. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, that's right. All the government scientific advisors
said the fellow was a crank. What about him? <br>
SARAH: He's disappeared. <br>
DOCTOR: Has he indeed? <br>
SARAH: About six months ago, he completely vanished. I checked with my
newspaper contacts up north. No trace. <br>
DOCTOR: And you think he could be behind all this? <br>
SARAH: Well, it's a possibility. He was a brilliant scientist, and he
must have been bitterly disappointed when the government refused that
grant. <br>
DOCTOR: You could be right, Sarah. It's worth checking up on. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'll get on to it. Intelligence records may have
something on him. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'd like to see the application for that grant. See the
man's working papers. <br>
BRIGADIER: Right. They must be on file somewhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Brigadier, have your fellows brought the Tardis back to
UNIT HQ for me yet? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, should be there by now. <br>
DOCTOR: Could you give me a run down there? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, thanks, there's one or two things inside I think I might
need. <br>
SARAH: Oh, what about your little pet out there? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right for a while. You've placed guards? <br>
BRIGADIER: General Finch has lent me a squad. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
SARAH: But suppose it dematerialises while you're not here? <br>
DOCTOR: Then my instruments will obtain the necessary readings. Coming?
<br>
SARAH: Yes, yes. Er, Brigadier? <br>
BRIGADIER: Mmm? <br>
SARAH: Can I bring a camera back here with me? <br>
BRIGADIER: Whatever for? <br>
SARAH: Well, for my story. I'm a journalist, remember? You don't think
I'm going to miss an opportunity like this? <br>
BRIGADIER: I am sorry, Miss Smith. This whole affair's under strict
security black-out. You can take your photographs when the crisis is
passed. <br>

SARAH: His colleagues at Oxford, the science correspondent of The Times
and the editor of Nature. <br>
GROVER: He may be brilliant in other fields, Miss Smith, but as far as
his time travel theory is concerned, I was assured it's worthless.
Doctor, I understand that you have set up an experiment which may give

SARAH: No, it's too big a coincidence. I'm not going to let go of this.
<br>
FINCH: What can you do? <br>
SARAH: Keep looking until I find him. I'll make them believe me. The
Brigadier's being completely uncooperative. He wouldn't even let me get
some photographs of that monster they've got chained down. <br>
FINCH: Well, you've got a pass, haven't you? <br>
SARAH: Oh! I tried! When I got back there, they wouldn't let me in.
Said I had to have a special pass. <br>
FINCH: Special army pass from my HQ. <br>
SARAH: You couldn't give me a pass, could you? I wouldn't publish

Rex through the observation window. The automatic flash goes off. More
flashes and the dinosaur's eyes flicker. A few more then Sarah decides
on some close ups. She goes into the hangar proper and takes more flash
photographs within arms reach of the monster. As she puts down the
camera to change the film, T Rex rises up. Sarah screams and runs back
to the office. The external door is locked. The dinosaur rises onto its
hind legs, roaring. Meanwhile, the Doctor is driving through

DOCTOR: It was a deliberate attempt on Sarah's life. <br>
BRIGADIER: Why should anybody want to kill her? <br>
BENTON: They were probably after you, Doctor. I mean, they expected you

BRIGADIER: Yes, of course, that'll be it. Well, Doctor, any

DOCTOR: Yes, I shall build another detector. <br>
BRIGADIER: We haven't got to capture another dinosaur? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. No, this time I'm going to try something different. I'm
going to build a portable device to detect that power source. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, why didn't you do that in the first place? <br>
DOCTOR: Because, Brigadier, it cannot be as accurate or as powerful as
this would have been. But it could give us the general direction. <br>
SARAH: Doctor? Exactly how much energy would be needed to make these
things appear? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, something like a small nuclear generator. <br>
SARAH: Then why don't we look for one? <br>
BRIGADIER: Miss Smith, that was one of the first things that occurred
to me. I made a thorough check and I can assure you that there are no
unaccounted for nuclear generators in the central London area. <br>
DOCTOR: No, he's right you know, Sarah. It is pretty unlikely, isn't
it. Look, why don't you try and get some rest. <br>
SARAH: All right. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, I'll be getting on with it. <br>

BENTON: Well, would you like a cup of tea or anything? <br>
SARAH: Typical! Run away and play while the grown-ups get on with the

BENTON: What do you mean? <br>
SARAH: The power's coming from somewhere, right? So there must be an
independent source. <br>
BENTON: I suppose so, but where would you start <br>
SARAH: So if it is a nuclear reactor it would have been designed and
assembled, and all that could be traced. There'd be records. <br>
BENTON: The Brigadier's checked all that, Miss. If there was anything
there then he would have found it. <br>
SARAH: Well, maybe it was all secret. <br>
BENTON: Too secret for the Brigadier to know about? <br>
SARAH: Yes, why not? Can you get me some transport? <br>
BENTON: Oh no, I couldn't do that. <br>

Prime Minister if I'm in charge, I'm going to stay here, on the spot.
Now, what can I do for you? <br>
SARAH: Well, you know the Doctor's theory about these materialisations?
They must need a tremendous energy force. <br>
GROVER: Yes? <br>
SARAH: Well, the Doctor said it would have to be something like a
nuclear generator and that started me remembering something. Wasn't
there a plan once to build underground quarters for the government in
the event of an atomic war? <br>
GROVER: Yes, back in the cold war days. Oh, I see what you're getting
at. Oh, I don't think any of them were ever built, you know. <br>

nuclear generator. <br>
GROVER: That's right. I was a junior backbencher at the time but I
remember plans were made and then shelved when the situation eased. <br>
SARAH: But suppose one was built, right here in London. <br>
GROVER: That's a very ingenious theory, young lady. What does the
Brigadier think about it, or the Doctor? <br>

BUTLER: Needn't be such a bad thing. We can deal with him here and now.
Let's see. He's going towards the reactor. <br>

slams down in front of the Reactor room door just as the Doctor gets
there. The Doctor heads down another passageway, and a shutter comes
down behind him.) <br>
WHITAKER: He's heading towards the Cabinet room. <br>
BUTLER: Right. <br>
(The Doctor turns left in front of a lift, turns another corner and
gets a shutter coming down in front of him this time. Butler sniggers.
The Doctor is now trapped outside a lift, which opens for him. The
Doctor steps in and is taken upwards. There are no overalls and mops in
this one, but the same blue light flashes on the diagram.) <br>
BUTLER: He's in the lift. Is everything ready? <br>

BRIGADIER: All right, Doctor. I think I can cope with it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Adam enters.) <br>
MARK: Adam, you've got to help us. <br>
ADAM: I know. I overheard. I had to wait until Ruth was out of the way.
<br>
(Adam cuts them free.) <br>
ADAM: Now, what are we going to do? <br>
SARAH: Get to the flight deck and open that airlock!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Underground station]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: Are you ready, Doctor? This is the last
flare. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, nearly ready. Come on. <br>
(The Doctor trails the wires away from the cleaner's cupboard and back
to the stairs. The Brigadier backs away from the confused dinosaur and
joins him. The Doctor pushes the detonator and KaBOOM!) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, let's take a look. <br>
(The cupboard floor has been blown away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, there it is. Right, I'm going down there. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'll come with you. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'd rather go on my own. It's less conspicuous. You go and
get those reinforcements, will you? <br>
BRIGADIER: Right.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Brigadier uses the radio in the Land Rover.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Greyhound one to Trap Two. Over.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[UNIT HQ - temporary]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BENTON: Trap Two. Sergeant Benton here, sir.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Underground station]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: Now look, we've broken through and the
Doctor's inside. What about those reinforcements?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[UNIT HQ - temporary]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BENTON: Just one mobile patrol, sir. That's all I
could raise. <br>
BRIGADIER [OC]: Better than nothing. Bring them along. <br>
BENTON: Yes, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER [OC]: Quick as you can, Benton, out. <br>
(Finch is covering Benton with his pistol.) <br>
BENTON: Look, sir, I've got to send those reinforcements. The
Brigadier's in trouble. <br>
FINCH: You'll do as you're told, Sergeant. <br>
BENTON: Sir, I've got to send them. <br>
FINCH: I'm warning you, Sergeant. <br>
BENTON: Very good, sir. <br>
(Benton turns back to the radio then swings round quickly grabbing
General's gun hand. They tussle, and Finch is pushed backwards over a
table.) <br>
FINCH: You'll be court martialled for this, Sergeant! <br>
BENTON: Yes, sir. <br>
(Benton thumps the General's gun hand against the table.) <br>
BENTON: Very sorry, sir!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Spaceship]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ADAM: I think you should at least listen, Ruth. <br>
ROBINSON: That does sound reasonable, to listen. <br>
RUTH: Very well. What is it you want me to listen to? <br>
SARAH: I think it's best if you just watch. <br>
RUTH: What's she going to do? <br>
MARK: Open the airlock. <br>
RUTH: But she'll kill herself! She'll kill us all! <br>
ADAM: If she's wrong, she's the only one that will suffer. <br>
(Sarah is inside the airlock. She opens the outer door and nothing
happens. Smiling, she returns through the inner door.) <br>
MARK: You see? <br>
(The other people mutter in the background.) <br>
SARAH: The people who tricked you are out there. Now is your chance to
demand an explanation. <br>
(Ruth leads everyone out. Meanwhile, the Doctor is in the bunker. He
hides as Butler approaches, then grabs him and uses his pressure points
to knock him out.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WHITAKER: Everything's ready. <br>
GROVER: General Finch should be here. <br>
WHITAKER: I hope you don't propose to wait. The timing is crucial. <br>
GROVER: He must be somewhere in the area. So long as he's in the
protective field, he'll be all right. <br>
ADAM: Stop! We shall have no part in this. <br>
(The people from the spaceship enter. Mark grabs Whitaker before he can
pull a lever.) <br>
RUTH: You've cheated us. <br>
GROVER: My friends, listen to me. I have not cheated you. Let Professor
Whitaker pull that lever and you shall have the golden age that I
promised you. <br>
ADAM: You're going to destroy all the civilisations of man. Leaving
Earth for another planet, that was one thing, but this is evil! <br>
GROVER: Civilisation has already destroyed man. It's time to make a
fresh start. If we take the Earth back in time, we can guide man onto a
better path. <br>
(The Doctor enters.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, Doctor! <br>
GROVER: Congratulations, Doctor. You're just in time to be present at
the most important moment in the world's history. <br>
DOCTOR: On the contrary, I'm just in time to prevent an atrocity. <br>
(The Brigadier and Benton enter with a couple of soldiers.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Don't move, any of you! Benton. <br>
(Whitaker throws off Mark and pulls a lever. A fierce time eddy fills
the room, freezing everyone. Only the Doctor is unaffected, who pushes
against the effect to put the lever back where it was. Then the Doctor
goes to another panel and flicks some switches. Grover dives for the
lever again.) <br>
WHITAKER: No! He's reversed the polarity! <br>
(Whitaker and Grover fight over the lever.) <br>
DOCTOR: Keep back! <br>
(Grover pulls the lever down again, and he and Whitaker and the console
disappear.) <br>
SARAH: Well, where've they gone? <br>
DOCTOR: Back to their golden age. And I hope they like it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[UNIT HQ - temporary]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: I still don't understand, Doctor. When
Whitaker first pulled that switch, was time reversed or wasn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: It was for the world outside the forcefield. Your time was just
frozen for a few seconds. <br>
SARAH: But what about you? Oh no, don't tell me. You're a Time Lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite! <br>
SARAH: Poor Grover. <br>
BRIGADIER: The man was mad. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, of course he was mad. But at least he realised the
dangers this planet of yours is in, Brigadier. The danger of it
becoming one vast garbage dump inhabited only by rats. <br>
BRIGADIER: It'll never happen, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not the the oil and the filth and the poisonous chemicals
that are the real cause of pollution, Brigadier. It's simply greed. <br>
BRIGADIER: Hmm. Well, I've got work to do, writing my deposition for
General Finch's court martial. <br>
BENTON: Excuse me, sir? What about Captain Yates? <br>
BRIGADIER: Extended sick leave and a chance to resign quietly. Best I
could do. <br>
DOCTOR: Poor Mike. <br>
BRIGADIER: Come on, Benton. <br>
BENTON: Still I'll say one thing. Not many Sergeants get the chance to
punch a General on the nose. <br>
BRIGADIER: Just don't make a habit of it, Benton. <br>
(The Brigadier and Benton leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there you are, Sarah. I told you I'd get you home safely,
didn't I. <br>
SARAH: Oh, of all the cheek. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's not my fault if people get up to no good while we
were away. <br>
SARAH: Alien monsters, robber barons, then dinosaurs. It'll be a long
time before I get in that Tardis again. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. It's a pity, that. <br>
SARAH: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, er, I was rather thinking of making a trip to Florana. <br>
SARAH: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Florana. Probably one of the most beautiful planets in the
universe. <br>
SARAH: Well, count me out. <br>
DOCTOR: It's always carpeted with perfumed flowers. <br>
SARAH: I'm not listening. <br>
DOCTOR: And its seas are as warm milk and the sands as soft as swan's
down. <br>
SARAH: No, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: The streams flow with water that are clearer than the clearest
crystal. <br>
SARAH: No. <br>
