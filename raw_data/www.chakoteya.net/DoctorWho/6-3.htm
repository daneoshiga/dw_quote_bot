<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis has reassembled itself and everyone is
on board.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, it's all right. It worked. <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie! You're right! We'd better just check, though. <br>
ZOE: Are we actually on our way, Doctor, or are we stuck somewhere? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's see shall we? <br>
(The Doctor switches on the scanner to show a cratered body in the
foreground and a blue and white planet further away.) <br>
JAMIE: Where are we? What's that? <br>
ZOE: It's the moon, isn't it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. That's the dark side of the moon. We seem to have
stopped in space. <br>
ZOE: I remember seeing this before. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, Zoe. That light on the Moon's surface. Do you see it? <br>
ZOE: Doctor! It's getting bigger! It's coming towards us! <br>
DOCTOR: Zoe, that's a missile! <br>
JAMIE: A what? <br>
ZOE: It's a missile? Somebody's fired a missile at us, Jamie! Oh
Doctor, come on, let's get out of here. <br>
DOCTOR: Now don't fuss me, Zoe. <br>
ZOE: Well, what's happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's the landing circuit. It seems to have jammed. That's
why we're stuck in space. Ah. <br>
(The Doctor pulls a lever off and thumps the console with it.) <br>
ZOE: We'll never make it! Oh, we're too late! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the stupid thing! Oh! <br>
(KaBOOM. The Tardis has vanished and something else flies away from
where it was. In a peaceful pasture, a cow looks up as a disembodied
blue flashing light appears above the ground, followed by a police box.
In the Tardis, everyone gets up from the floor.) <br>
JAMIE: I think we've landed. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sorry about that, Jamie. Are you all right, Zoe? <br>
ZOE: Yes, I think so. <br>
JAMIE: Anyway, we weren't blown to pieces by that missile thing. <br>
ZOE: Why would anybody want to fire a missile at us? Surely they'd find
out who we were first? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Unless they knew already. <br>
ZOE: The question is, was the object we saw on the other side of the
moon in this time zone or not? <br>
JAMIE: You mean it could still be out there? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, let's have a look. <br>
(The scanner shows a curious cow. They all laugh.) <br>
DOCTOR: We're certainly not on the moon's surface, are we. <br>
JAMIE: What's the matter with the Tardis, Doctor? It keeps going wrong
all the time. <br>
DOCTOR: It merely needs an overhaul, Jamie, just like any piece of
machinery. <br>
ZOE: Well, haven't you got any spares? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. We shall have to see if we can get some made. Lets have
a further look, shall we? <br>
(An electricity pylon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it could be twentieth century. England in summertime, I
should say. See the rain clouds? We might try and look up our old
friend Professor Travers in London. He might be able to help us. <br>
JAMIE: Aye. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Always supposing he's not a baby or a schoolboy. Now, come
along. Let's just collect this circuit, and I think I'd better see this
one. There. It's all right. It's just a fault in the visual stabiliser
circuit. We'd better take that too. <br>
(The Tardis vanishes.) <br>
JAMIE: Doctor? Doctor? Where are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, take my hand. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe come out of the
invisible Tardis and walk across the field to the road. I hope everyone
remembers where they parked. A military style lorry comes along and the
Doctor waves it down.) <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder if you could help us? <br>
MAN: Are you trying to get out? <br>
DOCTOR: We're trying to get to London. <br>
MAN: Get in. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's very civil of you. <br>
MAN: Well shut up, will you, and get in. <br>
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie climb into the back of the lorry. It drives
off and two motorcycles follow. The driver sees them and after a short
while has to pull over. He opens the tailgate.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is something wrong? <br>
MAN: Look, we'd better get clear of the lorry. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Roadside]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They hide in a small wood by the road.) <br>
JAMIE: What's happening? Why are we hiding? <br>
MAN: Company security were on my trail. <br>
ZOE: Which company? <br>
MAN: Come on, there's only one company. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you see, we're strangers around here. <br>
MAN: Strangers? Then you're not from the community, then? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
MAN: Then how did you get inside the compound? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's rather a long story. You see <br>
ZOE: This community you talked about, are they prisoners here then? <br>
MAN: Those who haven't gone over to the company are, yes. Not that they
say you can't get out. They just make it pretty impossible without
passes. <br>
JAMIE: You can move in and out. <br>
MAN: I got in all right. But getting out might be just a bit more
difficult. <br>
DOCTOR: This company, what do they do? <br>
MAN: International Electromatics. Now surely you've heard of them? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no, we've been a little out of touch. <br>
MAN: You must have been. They're the worlds biggest electronics
manufacturers. You can hardly buy a piece of equipment that isn't
theirs. Quick, get down. <br>
(Two motorcycles roar past.) <br>
ZOE: Well, what is this place, this compound? <br>
MAN: They set up a whole community of their own. Factories. Houses. A
vast network of industrial complexes. All of the local people have been
bought out. Most of them join the company. The others <br>
ZOE: What about them? <br>
MAN: My people haven't been able to trace them. <br>
DOCTOR: Your people? <br>
MAN: Should be safe now. We're not far from the guard post. You three
had better stay out of sight in the lorry. I'll try and bluff our way
out. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lorry]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They come up to a gate in high chainlink fence
topped with barbed wire, manned by uniformed armed guards.) <br>
JAMIE: We're slowing down. Must be the guard post now. <br>
ZOE: Yes, but why are we hiding like this? We've done nothing wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll find out later. Keep down. <br>
(One guard checks the man's pass while another walks round the lorry.
The man is allowed to drive on. Shortly afterwards, the motorcycle
riders arrive.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Road]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The lorry stops and the man opens the tailgate.) <br>
MAN: They're right behind us. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well, thank you very much. <br>
MAN: They're there in the distance. Now come on, get lost! <br>
(The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie go behind the hedge and leave. The
motorcycles pull up. The riders are wearing the same uniforms as the
guards at the gate.) <br>
BIKER: Hey, you. I want to see your pass. You will come back with us
for questioning. <br>
MAN: Oh come off it. That pass is in order, isn't it? <br>
BIKER: Don't argue! Follow us. <br>
MAN: Oh, no, I'm not going back inside that compound, and there's
nothing you can do to make me. <br>
BIKER: You will come back with us. <br>
MAN: Look we're not on IE property now, you've no authority. <br>
(The bikers aim their pistols at him.) <br>
MAN: Sorry. You want to hold me, get onto the police. See you. <br>
(The bikers shoot the man. A little way away, the Doctor flags down a
car.) <br>
DOCTOR: Can you give us a lift to London? <br>
CAMFIELD: Yes, I suppose so. <br>
(This is the director, Douglas Camfield.) <br>
DOCTOR: In you get. <br>
CAMFIELD: All right? <br>
(Zoe and Jamie get in the back, while the Doctor takes the passenger
seat.) <br>
JAMIE: Thank you. Thank you very much. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor goes up the steps to the front door of
number 18, St James' Gardens.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here we are. Right. That's odd. It says Watkins. <br>
JAMIE: Must have the wrong house. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the telephone directory definitely said number eighteen.
We'll ask. <br>
(The Doctor rings the bell labelled Watkins several times, until the
occupant, a young woman gets fed up and answers it.) <br>
ISOBEL: If you don't mind, I'm trying to work! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry miss, but we wondered whether
you could help us? We wondered if <br>
(Isobel takes a camera off its tripod.) <br>
ISOBEL: Oh look, the stupid thing's gone and jammed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear. Perhaps I could help you. <br>
ISOBEL: Well, do you know anything about cameras? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, a little. I see <br>
ISOBEL: Now, I had it on automatic shutter. <br>
DOCTOR: You're taking photos of yourself? <br>
ISOBEL: Yes, and then you interrupted me and the stupid thing jammed!
Have you come to see my uncle? He's not here. But who are you? Friends
of his? Fellow nuts? <br>
DOCTOR: Please let me answer one question at a time. <br>
ISOBEL: Hey, you be careful of that thing. It cost me a fortune. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, it's a very simple mechanism. Who is your
uncle? <br>
ISOBEL: Professor Watkins. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Then Professor Travers doesn't live here? <br>
ISOBEL: Well, he did. He left about a month ago. Gone to America for a
year with his daughter. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, that's just great. <br>
ISOBEL: My uncle worked at the Cavendish labs. He wanted to do some
work so Professor Travers said he could use his daughter's lab here.
And I moved in because I got kicked out of my studio last week. <br>
DOCTOR: What field of science is your uncle in? <br>
ISOBEL: Oh, I don't know. He's in applied physics or something. Always
messing around with computers and things. Complete nuts. <br>
DOCTOR: Well that is fortunate. Perhaps he might be able to help us. Is
he at home? <br>
ISOBEL: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, where is he? <br>
ISOBEL: Well, how do I know? I'm not his keeper. Hey, have you fixed
it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's all right. <br>
ISOBEL: That's really great. Thanks! <br>
DOCTOR: Miss. <br>
ISOBEL: (to Zoe) Hey! That's a jolly outfit. (the glitter catsuit)
Would you mind posing for me? <br>
ZOE: What? <br>
ISOBEL: Look, just stand there. <br>
DOCTOR: Miss? <br>
ISOBEL: Isobel. Yeah. Now, just stand here. Head over the shoulder. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you any idea when your uncle is going to be back? <br>
ISOBEL: No, he left about a week ago, I haven't seen him since. <br>
JAMIE: A week? <br>
ISOBEL: Yeah, he was prattling on about some new invention, or
something or other, and having the chance to develop it. Now. Not you. <br>
JAMIE: Oh. <br>
ISOBEL: Okay now, just&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Can't you get in touch with him? <br>
ISOBEL: No, I tried. I wanted to borrow a couple of quid off him in a
hurry, but well, they said he wasn't available for phone calls. <br>
DOCTOR: They? Now who is they? <br>
ISOBEL: Just get that, will you? I don't know. International Electric
something or other. <br>
ZOE: International Electromatics? <br>
ISOBEL: Yes, probably. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean your uncle has gone to work for these people? Well,
surely we can get in touch with him. <br>
ISOBEL: Well, you can try telephoning but I doubt if you'll get any
joy. Phone's in the hall and the number's scribbled on the wall. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(The Doctor and Jamie leave.) <br>
ISOBEL: Hey. Don't go. I don't often get the chance of photographing a
real model. <br>
ZOE: Oh, all right. <br>

JAMIE: Doctor, Do you suppose this firm could be the one that driver
was talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure of it. <br>
JAMIE: In that case, Watkins could have been kidnapped! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Jamie. You mustn't let your imagination run away with you.
I must admit, it's a bit strange. <br>
WOMAN [OC]: International Electromatics company. State your business. <br>
DOCTOR: I would like, please, to speak with Professor Watkins. <br>
WOMAN [OC]: One moment. (long pause) Party not available. <br>

ZOE: No, thanks. I think I'll stay here. It's great fun. <br>

ISOBEL: Oh, that's scribbled on the wall too. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. <br>
JAMIE: Do you not write anything down on paper at all? <br>
ISOBEL: Well, I'd only lose it if I did. Writing on a wall's much
safer. You can't lose a wall, can you? <br>
JAMIE: No. <br>

- Millbank Tower actually - and enter the deserted reception area.
There is one door labelled IE - no unauthorised entry - so the Doctor
goes through. Outside, two men in a car watch them. The Doctor comes
face to face with computer bank complete with magnetic tape and
flashing lights.) <br>

WOMAN: I am sorry. All personnel are engaged. <br>
DOCTOR: But I insist. This is an emergency! <br>
WOMAN: State the nature of the emergency. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a private matter. <br>

VAUGHN: I must apologise for Packer's crude devotion to duty. But your
method of entry into my building was rather unconventional, wasn't it? <br>
JAMIE: Aye, well, there was no need for all that gas and stuff. <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie. I think perhaps it is we who should be apologising to
you, Mister <br>
VAUGHN: Vaughn. Tobias Vaughn. I'm the managing director of
International Electromatics. Your business must be very pressing to
force you to such extremes. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. <br>
VAUGHN: Concerning Professor Watkins? <br>
JAMIE: How did you know? <br>
VAUGHN: My computer. It reported directly to me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. <br>

Professor's working on an experiment and refuses to see anyone. <br>

the world. I'm sure they'd be able to assist you. Show me the circuits.

help you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, how very kind. <br>

JAMIE: No. What is it? <br>
VAUGHN: Surely you've seen them about. They're disposable transistor
radios. One of our latest products. Most popular. We've sold ten
million in this country alone. Here. Compensation for the treatment you
received from the worthy Packer. <br>

ordered us to destroy it and all similar machines. <br>

generated some emotion pulses. I'm convinced, Packer, that emotion
could be used to destroy them. <br>

playing this game for very high stakes, are we not? <br>
