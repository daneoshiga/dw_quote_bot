<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Leela, wearing the light coloured leather outfit,
is operating the Tardis controls and humming to herself. The time rotor
stops.) <br>
LEELA: We've stopped. <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
LEELA: We've stopped dead. <br>
K9: Negative dead. <br>
LEELA: Oh. Doctor! <br>
(The Doctor enters, wearing a smock and beret, and carrying a wall
painting brush.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
LEELA: We've stopped. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>
LEELA: I mean, everything's still working. Nothing's gone wrong, has
it? <br>
DOCTOR: Not so far, no. <br>
LEELA: Then why have we stopped? Why are we not going anywhere? <br>
(The Doctor turns on the scanner. It is black.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's intensely interesting. Do you realise there's nowhere to
go? <br>
LEELA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: We're on the edge of the cosmos, the frontiers of creation, the
boundary between what is and isn't, or isn't yet, anyway. Don't you
think that's interesting? <br>
LEELA: I suppose so. <br>
DOCTOR: What? I feel just like a goldfish looking out on a new world. <br>
LEELA: A goldfish? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: But it's just black nothing out there, and being out here on our
own is just, just nothing. <br>
K9: We are not alone. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing? <br>
LEELA: Nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing? It's magnificent. Any minute, any second, a whole new
world could be born and we'd be the first <br>
K9: We are not the first. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. We'd be the first intelligent and semi-intelligent
beings to witness the spectacle. <br>
K9: We are not alone. <br>
DOCTOR: What's he saying? <br>
LEELA: I don't know. <br>
K9: We are not the first. We are not alone. Receptors indicate pulsing.
Pulsing characteristic of ion drive system. The inference therefore
would be spacecraft in vicinity. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Where, K9, where? <br>
K9: Thirty four seven zero one seventeen fifty zero five. <br>
DOCTOR: Thirty four seven? That's beyond visual aid range. <br>
(The Doctor and Leela operate controls.) <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, Leela. Listen! Ion drive, or I'm a budgie's cousin. <br>
K9: Affirmative ion drive. Family grouping negative. <br>
DOCTOR: Shut up, K9. Shut up. <br>
LEELA: Doctor! <br>
(A big red thing appears on the scanner.) <br>
DOCTOR: I can tell him to shut up if I want to. <br>
LEELA: No, no, no. Look! <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
(The red thing twirls its way across the screen.) <br>
DOCTOR: Leela. <br>
LEELA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: That's a spiral nebula. A gas cloud coalescing to form a whole
new star system. It's sucking in everything around it like a gigantic
whirlpool, including us. <br>
LEELA: Is that good? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's bad. Very bad. <br>
(An alarm starts blaring.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time to get out of here. K9, escape coordinates. <br>
K9: Thirty four seven zero one seventeen fifty zero five. <br>
LEELA: But isn't that where the ion drive is? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The upper of a two level area, like in Robots of
Death, but this time it has comfy chairs instead of the usual hard
ones. We hear the sound of the Tardis materialising. A white haired
woman in silver spacesuit is sitting operating a console. Three men are
standing.) <br>
TALA: Nothing up front, Captain. Only the spiral nebula on two four
zero. <br>
JACKSON: Right, Tala. Stay on watch. Orfe, check the nebula, two four
zero. <br>
ORFE: Two four zero, checking. Too far off, sir. <br>
JACKSON: Then what was it? Tala, take out the nebula. Herrick? <br>
HERRICK: Nothing on targeter, sir. There's no blip, nothing. <br>
JACKSON: Right, let's think it again. It wasn't inside, it wasn't
outside, none of us saw anything, we've got no trace, but we all heard
it, didn't we? <br>
ORFE + HERRICK: Yes, sir. <br>
JACKSON: Let's hear it again, Orfe. <br>
(Orfe plays back the Tardis' sound.) <br>
JACKSON: Now, was that sound generated inside the ship or outside?
Anybody ever hear anything like that before? <br>
ORFE + HERRICK: No, sir. <br>
JACKSON: Run it through ident. <br>
ORFE: Sir. Ident running, sir. </font></p>

cobwebby place.) <br>
LEELA: The air is stale. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
LEELA: The door's locked. Nobody's been in here for years. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
(He picks up a metal item and reads the stamp on the bottom.) <br>
DOCTOR: Made in Minyos. Made in Minyos? Got it! The Minyans of Minyos.
This could be a Minyan patrol vessel. Have you ever heard of the Flying
Dutchman? <br>
LEELA: No. <br>
(Yes, but we have also heard of Minos, and Jason and the Argonauts.) <br>
DOCTOR: Pity, I've often wanted to know who he was. K9, could you give
me a date on that, do you think? <br>
K9: Isotope decay rate indicates one hundred K range. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I thought. <br>
LEELA: Me too. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a hundred thousand years old. The Minyan civilisation
was destroyed a hundred thousand years ago, on the other side of the
universe. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Flight deck]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ORFE: Ident concluded, sir. Signal identified as
relative dimensional stabiliser in materialisation phase as used in <br>
JACKSON: As used in what? Orfe, as used in what? <br>
ORFE: As used in the time ships of the gods. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[R1C hold]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: It was what happened on Minyos that led to
our policy of non-intervention. <br>
LEELA: Huh? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Well, the Minyans thought of us as gods, you see, which
was all very flattering and we were new at space-time explorations, so
we thought we could help. We gave them medical and scientific aid,
better communications, better weapons. <br>
LEELA: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Kicked up out at gunpoint. Then they went to war with each
other, learnt how to split the atom, discovered the toothbrush and
finally split the planet. <br>
LEELA: So this ship must have got away before the planet was destroyed.
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: That was a hundred thousand years ago. Nobody lives for a
hundred thousand years. Do they? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Flight deck]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tala's skin is very creased and dry.) <br>
ORFE: If it is the gods, they'll help us. Help us with the Quest. <br>
HERRICK: Help us? Like they helped us before? Helped to destroy
ourselves. No, if it is the gods, and there's no way of telling because
that ident is as worn out as everything else on board the ship, but if
it is the gods then they're the reason for it all. <br>
JACKSON: The reason for all what, Herrick? <br>
HERRICK: Well, everything! The Quest. They're playing games with us.
Oh, they do, you know. The gods use us for their sport. We should have
wiped them out when we had the chance. <br>
ORFE: We brought our own destruction on ourselves. <br>
HERRICK: Pacifist! If I get one of them in my sights again, then I'll
dematerialise him for good. If they're on board this ship, then I'll
sniff them out! <br>
JACKSON: Herrick! Sit down. <br>
HERRICK: Sir? Yes, sir. <br>
JACKSON: Time for the next sweep, Tala. Set up for the next sweep. <br>
TALA: Yes, sir. <br>
ORFE: Two four zero and cubit. <br>
TALA: Four zero and cubit. <br>
ORFE: It's going to take us close to the nebula, Captain. <br>
JACKSON: I know, but we have no choice. The Quest is the Quest. <br>
ORFE: The Quest is the Quest. <br>
(The ship shudders.) </font></p>

floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: You all right, K9? <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
LEELA: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Trouble. <br>
LEELA: I know that. <br>
DOCTOR: Blast the door, K9. <br>
K9: Blaster malfunction. Blaster malfunction. Blaster malfunction.
Blaster malfunction. <br>
(Leela uses an arm-held shield-like device she had been cleaning to
blast the doors open.) <br>
LEELA: What is this thing? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a Liebermann laser. Fires charged particles along a laser
beam. Don't ever play with strange weapons, Leela. <br>
LEELA: No, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: And switch the safety catch off. <br>
LEELA: Yes, Doctor. </font></p>

JACKSON: Take her off the flight deck! <br>
HERRICK: Yes, sir. <br>
JACKSON: Levelled out. <br>
ORFE: Nothing on rudder, sir. She's stuck, stuck on maximum. <br>
JACKSON: Do what you can. Can you shut down on drive? <br>
ORFE: We can, but it won't reduce her speed. She's already reached
maximum. <br>
JACKSON: Reverse thrust? <br>
ORFE: Tear the ship in two, sir. <br>
JACKSON: Right, give her all you can on left main and auxiliaries. Shut
down on all right propulsion units. <br>
ORFE: Yes, sir. <br>
JACKSON: We've got to veer off before we hit the gravity field or that
thing will suck us down like a whirlpool! <br>
(We'll call it the Charybdis nebula, then, shall we?) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Jackson runs down the step to where Herrick has
laid Tala on a couch.) <br>
JACKSON: How is she? <br>
HERRICK: She's not good, sir. She's gone past her regeneration point
deliberately, just like all the others. <br>
JACKSON: None of us likes it, but the Quest is the Quest. <br>
DOCTOR: Anything I can do? How do you do? <br>
JACKSON: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. <br>
HERRICK: How did you get here? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well, through the door. <br>
HERRICK: He's one of them! <br>
(Herrick grabs the Doctor.) <br>
LEELA: Stop! <br>
HERRICK: See, sir? They're on board. I warned you, they're on board! <br>
JACKSON: Orfe. <br>
(Orfe aims a beam at Leela from a small cannon on the flight deck
railing. She smiles and lowers the laser.) <br>
LEELA: Thank you. <br>
(Herrick grabs the laser from Leela.) <br>
HERRICK: Go on, get back! Get back to that panel. And you, too, get
back. I'll take them out now, sir. Just one quick blast. <br>
JACKSON: Calmly, Herrick. Wait for the word of command. Just a minute.
You, Doctor, you said you wanted to help? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, if I can, yes. <br>
JACKSON: Are you a Time Lord? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm a Time Lord. <br>
HERRICK: It was lies, all lies. He said he was a doctor! <br>
JACKSON: Orfe. <br>
(Orfe gives Herrick a go with the cannon and he calms down.) <br>
HERRICK: Thank you, Orfe. <br>
(Herrick hands the laser to the Doctor.) <br>
HERRICK: I'm sorry, friend. <br>
DOCTOR: That's all right. What happened to her? <br>
JACKSON: She collapsed. We know what to do. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you know what to do, why don't you do it? <br>
JACKSON: Herrick, take Tala to regen now. <br>
HERRICK: Yes, sir. <br>
(Orfe comes down from the flight deck as Herrick picks up Tala.) <br>
LEELA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
LEELA: His name is Orfe. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: What a beautiful name. <br>
JACKSON: Orfe, look after her then get back to your post. <br>
ORFE: Yes, sir. <br>
LEELA: Orfe. <br>
(Orfe leads Leela away to the flight deck.) <br>
DOCTOR: So you did develop the pacifier. <br>
JACKSON: Very few, and too late. <br>
DOCTOR: How long does the effect last? <br>
JACKSON: Is she a primitive? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, very, very. <br>
JACKSON: Well, several hours then. <br>
DOCTOR: Really. <br>
JACKSON: You say you're a doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
JACKSON: Of medicine? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, many things, many things. <br>
JACKSON: Crystalocybernetics? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear chap, what's the problem? <br>
JACKSON: That is. <br>
(The nebula fills the windows.) <br>
JACKSON: And this. It's worn out. <br>
DOCTOR: How much time have we got? <br>
JACKSON: We haven't. We're already in the gravitational field. We could
burn our way out if we had the main systems working. That's the
problem. Terminal cores are fragmented. <br>
DOCTOR: Mind if I take a look? <br>
JACKSON: We've been in mission a hundred thousand years, Doctor. The
ship wasn't designed for that. Neither were we. Each one of us has
regenerated a thousand times. Have you any idea what that means? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've been through it two or three times. Not pleasant. <br>
JACKSON: A thousand times plus, Doctor. None of us wants to go on, but
we must. The Quest is the Quest. But now we're like the ship,
degenerating faster than we can regenerate ourselves. Not the body, not
the mind, but the spirit. <br>
(Meanwhile, Herrick has placed Tala on one of hundreds of regen couches
somewhere else on board. He switches on the machine, and her skin
smoothes out. Her hair becomes long and blonde again, and she sits up.)
<br>
JACKSON: A ship of ghosts, Doctor, going on and on and unable to
remember why. <br>
(A crystal falls in two in the Doctor's hands.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's had it, I'm afraid. <br>
JACKSON: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. <br>
JACKSON: Then it's over. It's over at last. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me about this Quest. <br>
JACKSON: It was a missing spaceship, the P7E. We get signals from it,
we track it and lose it, track it and lose it. <br>
DOCTOR: But surely after all this time there won't be any survivors. <br>
JACKSON: Probably not. <br>
DOCTOR: So? <br>
JACKSON: It was carrying colonists. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Does the P7E have regeneration too? <br>
JACKSON: No, the P7E was carrying something much more important, at
least to us. The future of the Minyan race, our genetic inheritance. <br>
DOCTOR: A race bank. Hmm. <br>
JACKSON: The chance for a new people on a new planet. Minyos Two. Well,
that was the theory. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, it seems a pity to give up now, after all you've
been through. Do you know, there just might be the ghost of a chance,
if it's at all compatible. <br>
JACKSON: Compatible? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll see. K9? Where are you, boy? Come on, heel! K9! <br>
(K9 enters, noisily, passing over access points on the floor labelled
GC3, IC7, YU1, ZY9.) <br>
JACKSON: What's this? <br>
DOCTOR: He's my second best friend, aren't you, K9? <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: Try this. <br>
(The Doctor uses bulldog clips to fasten wires from the crystal using
control unit to K9's ears.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here, K9, feel anything? <br>
(K9 yelps.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right. From now on, you're in charge. K9, we want to avoid the
nebula. It's all yours, K9. You're on. What? <br>
K9: On line. In link up. Rudder control positive. Accelerator positive.
Ident nav control. All systems ready. <br>
(Lights start spinning on the various large wheel devices nearby.) <br>
K9: Stand by for G loading. All systems positive. <br>

know you're exhausted, but the Quest <br>
TALA: Is the Quest. Yes, Captain. <br>
JACKSON: Right, everybody back on station. Tala, take over from Orfe.
Continue with the sweep. <br>
HERRICK: Is it a trick, Captain? <br>
JACKSON: I don't care what it is. We've got full power on all stations
for the first time in I don't know how long. <br>
HERRICK: But you know what they're like. He's just setting us up for
something worse. <br>

DOCTOR: Leela! Leela, listen to me. You're primitive. Wild, warlike,
aggressive and tempestuous, and bad tempered too. <br>
LEELA: I am? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. You're a warrior leader from a warrior tribe. Courageous,
indomitable, implacable, impossible <br>
LEELA: Right, that's far enough! You stay where <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, put it away. You were pacified. <br>
LEELA: Pass? <br>
DOCTOR: Pacified. <br>

them! It was him, wasn't it? (Herrick) <br>

DOCTOR: Jackson, two four zero takes us right back into the nebula. <br>
JACKSON: That's right. If that's where P7E is, that's where we go. <br>
DOCTOR: But that could mean destruction. <br>
JACKSON: No, Doctor, it'll mean the end of the Quest. If P7E went in
there, so can we. <br>
DOCTOR: But P7E didn't go in there. She couldn't have! She must have
been there at the beginning and the nebula formed around her. <br>
HERRICK: How does he know that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's elementary physics. The still centre of a raging storm.
P7E might be in there and she might be safe, but if you go in after
her, it could mean destruction. <br>
JACKSON: Doctor, if P7E is there, we must find her. That is our
purpose. Destruction is a chance we take. The Quest is the Quest. <br>

K9 [OC]: Hull thickness seventy metres, increasing. <br>
JACKSON: Seventy metres! <br>
DOCTOR: We're being turned into a planet. <br>
JACKSON: But that's impossible! <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's not impossible, Jackson. It's simply gravity. This
ship's a large, heavy object surrounded by smaller, lighter, objects.
Our gravitational pull is greater than theirs. We attract them. They
stick to us. It all snowballs. <br>
K9 [OC]: Eighty metres, increasing. <br>

debris, the asteroid belt would have smashed us to pieces. Still, you
can't have everything, can you. <br>

We'll try it. Herrick? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Here are your race banks. <br>
JACKSON: (coming down the stairs) Then what are those? <br>
DOCTOR: That's what I intend to find out. <br>
(The Doctor takes the cylinders from the unit and holds them in front
of K9's 'ears'.) <br>
DOCTOR: K9, what do you make of these? <br>
K9: Analysis indicates fission grenades. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
K9: Do not proceed. Impossible to defuse. Explosive contents in excess
of two thousand megatons. <br>
DOCTOR: Two thousand megatons? <br>
JACKSON: How much time have we got? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
JACKSON: What are we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: I think I'd better get rid of them, don't you? <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
(The Doctor runs.) <br>
LEELA: Doctor, wait! <br>
(Leela and Idas follow.) </font></p>

IDAS: I don't know. <br>
LEELA: He may have need of us. We'll try this way. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ORACLE: Why? Why have they not been found? <br>
ANKH: The slaves are digging. <br>
ORACLE: Shall they not be found? Are they not my purpose? <br>
LAKH: They shall be found. It shall be done. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tunnel]</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor arrives at where the slaves are trying
to dig him out of the rockfall. He speaks to the black guard.) <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me, I'm a stranger here myself. Could you direct me to
the Oracle? <br>
RASK: Guards! I'll take those, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What, those? I wouldn't if I were you. They won't do you any <br>
RASK: Give them here. You, take care of him. And make sure you finish
him off this time. Then bring this lot back to the Citadel. <br>
DOCTOR: You're making a terrible mistake. Those are the wrong ones. <br>
RASK: You can do better than that, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, er. <br>
(Rask leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, getting rid of me isn't going to solve anything. Those
cylinders were bombs. Why don't we just wait a few minutes and then we
can all go together, hmm? <br>
(Leela shoots a guard.) <br>
LEELA: Doctor! Doctor, are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think so. Come on, let's get out of here. We've got
no time. Tell them they've got no time. <br>
IDAS: Listen to me! The prophecy's being fulfilled. Our god has come to
save us. We can escape to the stars. Hurry! <br>
LEELA: We must hurry! <br>
IDAS: Yes, come on, come on. <br>
LEELA: Come on! </font></p>

Quickly. <br>
ANKH: They have been found. <br>
ORACLE: Replace them, quickly. <br>
(The cylinders descend into the control unit.) <br>
ORACLE: They must never leave my keeping again. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Quiet! Quiet, everyone. Come on, here. <br>
(He picks up a little girl.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now listen to me. I want you to stay calm, and when I say, go
quickly but quietly. Ready? Take this little one. Off you go now. Come
on. Come on. </font></p>

going to be all right. All right, all right. <br>
JACKSON: What's going on? Get off, all of you. Off the ship! Get out! <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing? Never mind that! <br>
JACKSON: What are you doing? We can't take all these people! <br>
DOCTOR: No! Come on. <br>
JACKSON: We can't. We're too low on fuel. <br>
DOCTOR: This planet's going to explode. <br>
JACKSON: Then get them off. Get off! <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
JACKSON: I must safeguard the race bank. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
JACKSON: Why? The future of our people. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, Jackson. This is your people. This is your race.
Descendents of the people who came on the P7E. <br>
JACKSON: But we can't take the extra weight. <br>
DOCTOR: Look this planet is going to explode, Jackson. Your only hope
is to go, and go now. Go, Jackson, go! <br>
(Jackson leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Sit down, everybody. Sit down. Now, stay very calm. </font></p>

TALA: We don't have enough power to reach escape velocity. <br>

Persephone goes KaBOOM!) </font></p>

LEELA: Yes. Is Jackson Jason? <br>

LEELA: Well, is Jason Jackson? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Jason was another captain on a long quest. <br>
LEELA: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. He was looking for the Golden Fleece. <br>
LEELA: Did he find it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. He found it hanging on a tree at the end of the
world. Perhaps those myths are not just old stories of the past, you
see, but prophecies of the future. Who know? What do you think, K9? <br>
K9: Negative. <br>
DOCTOR: What did he say? <br>
LEELA: Negative. <br>
DOCTOR: Negative? Can he paint? Hmm? Negative. <br>
