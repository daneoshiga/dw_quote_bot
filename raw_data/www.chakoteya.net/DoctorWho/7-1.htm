<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (On Earth, a bored, sweaty, uniformed radar
operative sees a line of dots appear on his screen. He grabs the
internal telephone.) <br>
TECHNICIAN: Duty Officer, please. Urgent. <br>
(A woman in the same uniform enters.) <br>
OFFICER: What is it? <br>
TECHNICIAN: I've got something on here, ma'am. Something strange. <br>
OFFICER: Are you sure it's not just interference? Something to do with
the heat wave? <br>
TECHNICIAN: No, ma'am. There's something on there. <br>
OFFICER: Scan closer. Still very high. <br>
TECHNICIAN: Coming down fast though, ma'am, and heading this way. <br>
OFFICER: They must be meteorites. <br>
TECHNICIAN: But they're flying in formation. <br>
(Vapour trails in formation are formed in the atmosphere. In Oxley
Woods, a poacher is concealing a snare trap when he looks up to see a
group of very artificial objects whistling down towards him. He dives
for cover. Boom.) <br>
TECHNICIAN: They've come down. <br>
OFFICER: Where? <br>
TECHNICIAN: Sector five. Epping. <br>
OFFICER: Bearing? <br>
TECHNICIAN: Just working it out. You know, I still think it was a
formation, ma'am. There was a shape. <br>
(The poacher uses a stick to prod at the smoking area where the object
landed. He reveals a pulsating light under the layer of steaming hot
soil, so he covers it over again.) <br>
OFFICER: Control have reported that meteorite storm to UNIT HQ. <br>
TECHNICIAN: So Control didn't think they were meteorites either? <br>
OFFICER: What else could they be? Don't let your imagination run away
with you. <br>
TECHNICIAN: I suppose they must have been meteorites. Mustn't
they?&nbsp;<br>

grey-haired figure falls face down into the heather.)

chauffeured through an underground area, past a checkpoint. The office
is at the end of a corridor with vent ducting along it.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, ask her to come in. <br>
(He greets the woman at the door.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah, good. Miss Shaw, I'm Lethbridge-Stewart. Do come in and
sit down, will you? <br>
LIZ: Was all that nonsense out there really necessary? Identity passes?
Guards? I was even searched. <br>
BRIGADIER: Security. Rather amusing, don't you think? No, you don't. <br>
LIZ: I have an important research programme going ahead at Cambridge. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I know. An expert in meteorites, degrees in medicine,
physics and a dozen other subjects. Just the sort of all-rounder I've
been looking for. <br>
LIZ: How I feel doesn't matter? <br>
BRIGADIER: We need your help, Miss Shaw. <br>
LIZ: I'm just not interested in security work. <br>
BRIGADIER: Security? <br>
LIZ: Producing invisible ink. That sort of thing. <br>
BRIGADIER: We're not exactly spies here at UNIT. <br>
LIZ: Then what do you do, exactly? <br>
BRIGADIER: We deal with the odd, the unexplained, anything on Earth, or
even beyond. <br>
LIZ: Alien invaders? Little blue men with three heads? <br>
BRIGADIER: Ten tons of alien material drift through space and land on
this planet every day. <br>
LIZ: And do no harm to anyone. <br>
BRIGADIER: Early this morning a shower of about fifty meteorites landed
in Essex. <br>
LIZ: Landed? Most meteorites don't even reach the Earth's surface. They
usually burn up in the atmosphere. <br>
BRIGADIER: These didn't. These particular meteorites came down through
a funnel of thin, super-heated air about twenty miles in diameter, for
which no one has an explanation. <br>
LIZ: There must be an explanation, a natural one. <br>
BRIGADIER: I hope so. We didn't find one last time. <br>
LIZ: Last time? <br>
BRIGADIER: Six months ago, a smaller shower of meteorites, about five
or six, landed in the same area. <br>
LIZ: No, that's impossible. The odds against two lots of meteorites
landing in exactly the same place must be incredible. <br>
BRIGADIER: They are, Miss Shaw. They are.

Studies, Baltimore. Do you realise that in our section of the galaxy,
there are over five hundred planets capable of supporting life? <br>
LIZ: Why is Earth any more likely to be attacked now than during the
last fifty thousand years? <br>
BRIGADIER: In the last decade, we've been sending probes deeper and
deeper into space. We've drawn attention to ourselves, Miss Shaw. <br>
LIZ: Aren't you being a bit alarmist? <br>
BRIGADIER: Since UNIT was formed, there've been two attempts to invade
this planet. <br>
LIZ: Really? <br>
BRIGADIER: We were lucky enough to be able to stop them. There was a
policy decision not to inform the public. <br>
LIZ: Do you seriously expect me to believe that? <br>
BRIGADIER: It's not my habit to tell lies, Miss Shaw. <br>
LIZ: I'm sorry, but it is a fantastic story. <br>
BRIGADIER: We were very lucky on both occasions. We had help from a
scientist with a great experience of other life forms. <br>
LIZ: Really? Who was this genius? <br>

him the Doctor. <br>

HENDERSON: Me playing tricks? Who is that? <br>
LOMAX [OC]: Doctor Lomax, path lab. You just sent up a blood sample for
cross matching. <br>
HENDERSON: Yes, that's right. Just routine. <br>
LOMAX [OC]: Listen, Henderson, I will not tolerate stupid practical
jokes. It wasn't human blood and you know it. <br>
HENDERSON: What do you mean, not human blood? I took it from the
patient myself. <br>
LOMAX [OC]: It is not a human blood type. The platelet stickiness shows
that. Henderson, are you there? Hello? <br>
HENDERSON: Doctor Lomax, I took that blood sample from an adult male

wonder you didn't recognise me. Oh, that face. That hair. Oh, I don't
know, though. I think it's rather distinctive, actually. Don't you
think? No, you don't. Oh, anyway, I'm tired. All this exercise and
exertion. It's been too much. Have to get some sleep now. <br>
