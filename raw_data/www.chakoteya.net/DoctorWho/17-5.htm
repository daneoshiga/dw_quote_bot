the bridge. The pilot's station is higher than his co-pilot's. An alarm
blares.) <br>
COPILOT: When are we going to get modern equipment? Proper battleships?
When are we going to fight again? <br>
PILOT: It's only a matter of a short time now. <br>
COPILOT: The computer's malfunctioning again. <br>
PILOT: I warned you, you're overloading it. The instructions are quite
clear. Until we get new equipment we must reroute all subsidiary
functions through the backup computer. <br>
COPILOT: But that takes hours to do! <br>
PILOT: We're twelve hours out from Aneth. Only another twelve to
Skonnos. <br>
COPILOT: Be a lot faster if this equipment worked properly. <br>
PILOT: Nimon will soon fulfil his great promise to us. <br>
(The co-pilot gets up and switches off the alarm.) <br>
PILOT: We must be patient. <br>
COPILOT: Patient? Patience is the virtue of the weak. Skonnons are
meant to fight, to conquer, to rule, as in the days when these ships
were built. <br>
PILOT: We'll fight, and Nimon will give us all we need. <br>
COPILOT: When? <br>
PILOT: When we have fulfilled our part of the contract. <br>
COPILOT: Oh, really? <br>
PILOT: This is to be the last shipment. <br>
COPILOT: The last? <br>
PILOT: Yes. Our part of the contract will be fulfilled. <br>
COPILOT: With this cargo? <br>
PILOT: Yes. <br>
COPILOT: I'll go and check it's safe. <br>

corridor to -) </font></p>

and women in yellow jumpsuits huddled together on the grating that
passes for a floor.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The co-pilot returns.) <br>
PILOT: How are they? <br>
COPILOT: Same as the cargo always is. Inferior, craven beings. They'd
have to be to surrender to us on an old ship like this. <br>
PILOT: The Anethans remember the old days, when these were the most
feared ships in the skies. Before we started fighting amongst
ourselves. <br>
COPILOT: Twelve hours to Skonnos. We can do it in six, right? <br>
PILOT: Not without overloading the computer. <br>
COPILOT: It can take it. We could do it in nine hours, okay? <br>
PILOT: Well, it means cutting out the dogleg round sector L seventy
five. <br>
COPILOT: It means getting home quickly with this last cargo. <br>
PILOT: Well, double check the programme. We mustn't overload it. <br>
COPILOT: It hardly matters. This ship will never have to fly again.
See? No problems at all. We could do it in six hours. <br>
PILOT: Six hours? You said nine hours. <br>
COPILOT: It'll make it. <br>
(Bang! A small fire breaks out behind the big pipe.) <br>
PILOT: You blundering fool! You've wrecked it. The automatic pilot's
gone dead. <br>
COPILOT: Well, it'll be all right, won't it? We can fly her on manual. <br>
PILOT: We're off course already. <br>
COPILOT: All we have to do is to find the beacon again. (beep) There,
there's the beacon. We can fly back to it. <br>
PILOT: We're moving further away from it. <br>
COPILOT: Well, push the engines up to full power! <br>
(The whole set of control panels and consoles start to shake and
creak.) <br>
PILOT: You blundering idiot! The ship's completely out of control! <br>
COPILOT: Steer, blast you! Steer! <br>
PILOT: It's not working. There's nothing we can do. </font></p>

(And so they do. There's a big bang, the bridge fills with smoke and
bits of ceiling fall down. The pilot and co-pilot are unconscious, and
the spaceship spins briefly on its axis before coming to a dead stop
in deep space.) </font></p>

console has equipment on it and wires sticking out.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. That should immobilise her for the moment. <br>
K9: Correction, master. The Tardis is moving. <br>
(The Doctor reads from 'Tardis handbook Type 40'.) <br>
DOCTOR: When making modifications, it's extremely important to shut
everything down except that which is not necessary to shut down. Well,
of course. Terribly easy to damage things otherwise. <br>
(The Doctor gets zapped.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! Like me, for instance. I'd better disconnect that. Good,
that should hold her steady. <br>
K9: Repeat, master. The Tardis is moving. <br>
DOCTOR: How can it be? I just completely immobilised her. <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good. <br>
K9: Still moving, and accelerating. <br>
DOCTOR: What? But K9, how can it be? <br>
(Romana enters from the interior, dressed in hunting pink jacket
complete with cravat, waistcoat, jodhpurs and riding boots.) <br>
ROMANA: He could be right, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, he could be right? How could he possibly be
right? He's only a dog, you know. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: We do seem to be moving. <br>
ROMANA: Very fast. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. But everything's off. Except what's on, of course. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, what have you been doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've just been trying out a little idea I had for a
slight modification of the conceptual geometer. <br>
ROMANA: (sighs) This is an old ship. <br>
DOCTOR: So what? <br>
ROMANA: Don't you think that's a bit dangerous? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don't. What could possibly go <br>
(Lurch. The Doctor falls.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! Wrong. You know, I've simply got to stop saying that. Every
single time I say what could possibly go wrong, something goes <br>
(Lurch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! It's uncanny, isn't it? <br>
ROMANA: A gravitational field? <br>
DOCTOR: There are no planets in the sector. <br>
ROMANA: But Doctor, we are moving. <br>
DOCTOR: Romana, do you think I'd dismantle half the control systems
including the conceptual geometer, the dematerialisation circuits <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The dematerialisation circuits. Do you think I'd do that if
there was the slightest risk of our being brought into a gravitational
field? <br>
ROMANA: You've immobilised the dematerialisation circuits <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Stay calm.
Watch. <br>
(He turns on the scanner. Total blackness, not even any nearby stars.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we are. Look. Nothing. Blackness. <br>
ROMANA: It may be black, but we are moving very fast. <br>
DOCTOR: Romana, we're moving very fast. <br>
ROMANA: Are we falling into a black hole? <br>
DOCTOR: No. It's not pulling hard enough for that. Anyway, there's
nothing charted. <br>
ROMANA: I hope you're right, because we can't dematerialise. <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating, isn't it? I wonder what it would be like to be
crushed to a singularity? <br>
ROMANA: Don't stand there wondering, do something. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? What? <br>
ROMANA: Put it together again. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, right, right. K9. We'll put it together again. I need your
help, K9. <br>
(The Doctor goes under the console, and there is another bang.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! You all right, K9? <br>
(K9's head is pointing muzzle up, not down.) <br>
DOCTOR: K9? K9, are you all right? K9! <br>
(The Doctor tries to give the kiss of life to the robot.) <br>
DOCTOR: K9. Come on, boy. Sorry about this, K9. <br>
(He turns the head round to the way it should be.) <br>
DOCTOR: K9, all you all right? <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good. <br>
(Another bang and lots of smoke from the console. There's a genuine
little fire under there now.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's only the defence shields. <br>
ROMANA: Only? Can you fix them? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I can fix anything, given time. <br>
ROMANA: Which is exactly what we don't have. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROMANA: Look. <br>
(The spaceship is on the scanner.) <br>
ROMANA: There is something. It's tiny. How can something so minute have
such an enormous gravitational pull? <br>
DOCTOR: How interesting. Ha, looks like a spaceship. <br>
ROMANA: And we're heading straight for it. </font></p>

look as if he has just magically appeared. It is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0189561/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Graham Crowden</a>, who
turned down the role of the Doctor, and went on to be Tom Ballard in
Waiting for God.) <br>
SOLDEED: I have spoken with the Nimon. <br>
SORAK: And what does he say, Soldeed? <br>
SOLDEED: He says many things. He speaks of the great journey of life.
He speaks of conquest. He speaks of Skonnos rising from its own ashes
with wings of fire. <br>
SORAK: Does he speak of the new ships? <br>
SOLDEED: He says we shall have them, and soon. The new sacrifices from
Aneth are the last that he demands. <br>
SORAK: Then we really are on the brink of having the promise fulfilled.
<br>
SOLDEED: I believe we are, Sorak. I do believe we are. The Second
Skonnon Empire will be born. </font></p>

K9: Collision imminent. <br>

(Bang! More smoke and burning bits of plywood fall from the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: You were right, K9. We have arrived. <br>
ROMANA: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we're jammed up against that spaceship. Pretty battered
old ship. Been here for years. Centuries, probably. I think we'll go
and take a look. <br>
ROMANA: It's not going to be easy to get across there. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Ah, here's a notion. The defence shield on the door's on a
different circuit. It might be possible to extrude it. <br>
ROMANA: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Watch. <br>
(A forcefield extends from the Tardis doors down to a nearby airlock.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. What do you think of that? <br>
ROMANA: Well done, Doctor. <br>

one of a series of triangular cupboards along the bulkhead.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha. <br>
(He takes out a transparent globe, which he opens to inspect the large
blue crystal inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, how commonplace. It looks like a crystalline rock of some
kind. <br>
ROMANA: Hymetusite. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I do believe it is. <br>
ROMANA: Hymetusite is highly radioactive! <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
K9: Master, I detect ultra-radiation level Q seven point three two
five. <br>
(The Doctor seals up the globe again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, K9. And now? <br>
K9: Level falling. Q one point eight six one, falling. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Now listen, K9. We're going to explore this ship and see
what makes it tick. <br>
K9: Source of radiation probably hymetusite crystalline <br>
DOCTOR: Not that sort of ticking, K9. <br>
K9: Master? <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, I want you to go back to the Tardis control room and
check out all the damage. Inspect all circuits so we see what we need
to put right. <br>
K9: Affirmative, master. <br>
DOCTOR: Off you go then. <br>
ROMANA: I suppose it's some sort of freighter. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. No one in his right mind would mix hymetusite and
passengers. <br>
ROMANA: I wonder where it was heading? <br>

Come, it's all right. Don't be frightened. Don't be frightened. Here,

DOCTOR: Oh, it's all right. Go on, you show them. <br>
(Romana eats a jelly baby.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we are. Now you have one. Go on, you can do it. <br>

Teka. The Doctor takes it from him.) <br>

SETH: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm the Doctor. This is Romana. Who are you? <br>
SETH: Seth. <br>

SETH: You've been to Aneth? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but not yet. <br>

TEKA: Where are we now? <br>
DOCTOR: Nowhere. <br>

SETH: Skonnos. <br>

DOCTOR: What? <br>
TEKA: We are the bearers of Aneth's tribute to the Nimon. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's all right. I heard what you said. I was just
thinking what a curious thing to be. <br>
SETH: We were on our way to Skonnos when something went wrong with the
ship. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
SETH: It felt as if it went out of control. There was a crash, then
silence, and here we are. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, here, as you so rightly say, we are. Huh. <br>
(The ship rumbles.) <br>
SETH: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Another thing's been drawn into the ship. <br>
ROMANA: A gravity whirlpool? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Sargasso Sea in space. Romana? <br>
ROMANA: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: Suppose, just suppose, someone were beginning to create a black
hole. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Artificially, I mean. <br>
ROMANA: Can it be done? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Fix gravity beam, attract matter to one point in space,
and when there's enough it starts to collapse to a singularity. But
who'd want to do that? <br>
ROMANA: Is it my imagination, or is the gravity increasing all the
time? <br>
(The Doctor lifts his foot and lets it drop.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'd say it was increasing. <br>
SETH: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: Unless we find a way of getting out of here, we're all going to
be crushed to a singularity. <br>
TEKA: What's a singularity? <br>
ROMANA: A mathematical point with no dimensions. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind about that. Seth, who's in charge of this ship? <br>
(The door behind the Doctor opens.) <br>
COPILOT: I am. <br>
(The Doctor promptly raises his hands because a gun is jabbed into his
back.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, pleased to see you. <br>
COPILOT: Who are you? What are you doing with the sacrifices? <br>
DOCTOR: Sacrifices? <br>
COPILOT: Sacrifices to the Nimon. Who are you, space pirates? <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
COPILOT: Why should I believe that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's a good question. Er, can you get us out of here? <br>
COPILOT: Can you? <br>
DOCTOR: I might be able to. Why don't you put that thing away and show
me your controls? <br>
COPILOT: Through there. <br>
DOCTOR: Aren't you going to put that thing away? <br>
COPILOT: Through there! <br>

ROMANA: He means the hymetusite. <br>
COPILOT: I mean the sacrifices. <br>
ROMANA: Sacrifices? <br>
COPILOT: The Anethans. I have to get them safely to Skonnos, whatever

SORAK: Well, it's the transport from Aneth, sir. The ship bringing the
final sacrifices? <br>
SOLDEED: What about it? <br>
SORAK: It's disappeared. <br>
SOLDEED: Disappeared? What are you talking about? <br>
SORAK: Completely vanished, sir. The last two routine signals have not
yet arrived. We thought it might be just a communications fault, but
nothing we can do can raise them at all. There's absolutely no trace. <br>

COPILOT: This is a battleship of the First Skonnon Empire. It will soon
be replaced. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the sooner the better. It's a right hodge-podge up there.
Very old engines patched up with new equipment, a lot of it not really
compatible. <br>
ROMANA: Sounds like the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
COPILOT: Can you make it work? <br>
DOCTOR: The odd thing is, the new equipment seems to be the product of
an entirely different technology. <br>
COPILOT: Can you make it work? <br>
DOCTOR: Have to noticed how people's intellectual curiosity declines
sharply the moment they start waving guns about? <br>
COPILOT: Can you make it work? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh yes, I can make it work. The question is, can we
generate power soon enough to take the ship to escape velocity before
we fall into a black hole with an event horizon. <br>
COPILOT: A what? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. You just hold the gun steady. Don't tax your mind. <br>
ROMANA: Do you think we have enough power? <br>
DOCTOR: Not with that fuel. <br>
ROMANA: What about the hymetusite? If we could convert the engines,
it's an immensely rich energy source. <br>
DOCTOR: Brilliant! I wish I'd thought of that. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, you will, Doctor, you will. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha ha. Take a look. <br>
(Romana goes up the ladder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, I've got to go back to my own ship to get some things. I
want you to fetch up two pieces of hymetusite to lower into the fuel
cell. Look, why don't you give me the gun and then I can keep an eye on
myself so that I don't get up to any funny business? <br>
COPILOT: Don't you play the fool with me, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. What do you think, Romana? <br>
ROMANA: I think it's possible. You're right, though. It's a strange
mixture of technologies up here. <br>

a neutrino conversion is. Did you know that someone's building a black
hole on your doorstep? <br>
SOLDEED: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I got stuck in it, along with one of your spacecraft. <br>
SOLDEED: Digging a black hole on my doorstep. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. A good thing I got stuck in it, too, otherwise your
ship would still have been there. <br>
SOLDEED: So it was you that rescued my ship? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, with a little help from my friend. Nice girl. I

sticking her nose in things that don't concern her. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, not much better. Nasty race of people. Still, they're too
busy fending for themselves to bother anyone else now. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
ROMANA: Look. <br>
(There's a distant explosion on the scanner.) <br>
DOCTOR: Crinoth. <br>
ROMANA: And the end of the Nimons. <br>
DOCTOR: Good job, too. <br>
ROMANA: I hope Seth and Teka and the others get back to Aneth safely. <br>
DOCTOR: I should hope so. I made Sorak give them a ship. <br>
ROMANA: Look, there they are. <br>
DOCTOR: Poor old Seth. <br>
ROMANA: Poor old Seth? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, just imagine the legends Teka's going to build up
around him. He'll have to spend the rest of his life trying to live up
to them. It's terrible. <br>
ROMANA: I suppose that's how legends are made. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm glad this time I reminded them to paint their ship
white. The last time anything like this happened, I completely forgot.
Caused quite a hoo-ha. <br>
ROMANA: What are you talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, other times, other places. Well, come on, old girl.
There's quite few millennia left in you yet. <br>
ROMANA: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Not you, the Tardis. </font> </p>
