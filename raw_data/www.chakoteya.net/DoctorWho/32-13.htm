running on aerial tracks through the Zurich Re building, cars carried
by balloons...)<br>
NEWSMAN [OC]: And it's another beautiful day in London. There are
reports of sunspot activity and solar flares causing interference
across all radio signals so apologies for that. Pterodactyls fly over
children playing in Hyde Park.) <br>
GIRL: Guys, look! <br>
(The pterodactyls swoop and the children run to the trees, past the
sign 'Pterodactyls are vermin. Do not feed.' <br>
A Roman centurion in a chariot waits at the traffic lights and the
headline on the Londinium Cotide is - War of the Roses enters second
year. <br>
On a TV in a shop window is a breakfast television programme -) <br>
BILL TURNBULL [on TV]: So do you think you can top last year's
Christmas Special? <br>
SIAN WILLIAMS [on TV]: And can you tell us anything about it? <br>
DICKENS [on TV]: Well, all I can say now is that it involves ghosts,
and the past, the present and future, all at the same time. <br>
SIAN WILLIAMS [on TV]: Ooo, we love a ghost story. <br>
NEWS ANCHOR [on TV]: Crowds lined the Mall today as Holy Roman Emperor,
Winston Churchill, returned to the Buckingham Senate on his personal
mammoth.

checked by his Silurian male nurse.) <br>
MALOHKEH: Not too many late nights in Gaul, I hope. <br>
CHURCHILL: Just the one. I had an argument with Cleopatra. Dreadful
woman. Excellent dancer. <br>
MALOHKEH: I can tell from your blood pressure. <br>
CHURCHILL: What time do you have, doctor? <br>
MALOHKEH: Two minutes past five, Caesar. <br>
CHURCHILL: It's always two minutes past five. Day or night, it's always
two minutes past five in the afternoon. Why is that? <br>
MALOHKEH: Because that is the time, Caesar. <br>
CHURCHILL: And the date. It's always the twenty second of April. Does
it not bother you? <br>
MALOHKEH: The date and the time have always been the same, Caesar. Why
should it start bothering me now? <br>
CHURCHILL: I want to see the Soothsayer. Where is he? <br>
MALOHKEH: In the Tower, where you threw him the last time. <br>
CHURCHILL: Get him. <br>
(A bedraggled figure in toga and shackles is brought it.) <br>
CHURCHILL: Leave us. Tick tock goes the clock, as the old song says.
But they don't, do they? The clocks never tick. Something has happened
to time. That's what you say. What you never stop saying. All of
history is happening at once. But what does that mean? What happened?
Explain to me in terms that I can understand what happened to time. <br>
DOCTOR: A woman.

from home and in terrible pain. Just when you thought it couldn't get
worse, you looked up and saw the face of the devil himself. Hello,
Dalek. <br>
DALEK: Emergency. Emergency. Weapon system disabled. Emergency. <br>
(The Doctor opens up the top of the Dalek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hush, now. I need some information from your data core.
Everything the Daleks know about the Silence.

the figure in the stetson, who then steps into a seedy space bar.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gideon Vandaleur. Get him. Now. <br>
BARMAN: Who says he's here? <br>
(The Doctor drops the Dalek's eyestalk onto the counter. A short while
later, the Doctor is at a table reading Knitting for Girls when the
cloaked figure sits down with him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Father Gideon Vandaleur, former envoy of the Silence. My
condolences. <br>
VANDALEUR: Your what? <br>
DOCTOR: Gideon Vandaleur has been dead for six months. <br>
(The Doctor sonicks the figure, which is wearing the same style
eyepatch as Madam Kovarian, and it goes rigid.) <br>

Never get bored of that. Long time since Berlin. <br>
CARTER: Doctor, what have you done to our systems? <br>
DOCTOR [on viewscreen]: They'll be fine if you behave. Now, this unit
can disguise itself as anyone in the universe, so if you're posing as
Vandaleur, you're investigating the Silence. Tell me about them. <br>
CARTER: Tell you what? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A game of chess is in progress, and a Queen is
sizzling with voltage. The Doctor's opponent is an alien in an
eyepatch.) <br>
DOCTOR: The crowd are getting restless. They know the Queen is your
only legal move, except you've already moved it twelve times, which
means there are now over four million volts running through it. That's
why they call it Live Chess. Even with the gauntlet you'll never make
it to Bishop Four alive. <br>
GANTOK: I am a dead man, unless you concede the game. <br>
DOCTOR: But I'm winning. <br>
GANTOK: Name your price. <br>
DOCTOR: Information. <br>
GANTOK: I work for the Silence. They would kill me. <br>
DOCTOR: They're going to kill me too, very soon. I was just going to
lie down and take it, but you know what? Before I go, I'd like to know
why I have to die. <br>
GANTOK: Dorium Maldovar is the only one who can help you. <br>
DOCTOR: Dorium's dead. The Monks beheaded him at Demon's Run. <br>
GANTOK: I know. Concede the game, Doctor, and I'll take you to him.

GANTOK: The Seventh Transept, where the Headless Monks keep the
leftovers. Watch your step. There are traps everywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: I hate rats. <br>
GANTOK: There are no rats in the transept. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good. <br>
GANTOK: The skulls eat them. <br>
(The skulls on shelves turn to look at the visitors.) <br>
GANTOK: The headless monks behead you alive, remember. <br>
DOCTOR: Why are some of them in boxes? <br>
(Nice boxes on pillars.) <br>
GANTOK: Because some people are rich, and some people are left to rot.
And Dorium Maldovar was always very rich. <br>
(The Doctor opens Dorium's box. The blue head sneezes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you for bringing me, Gantok. <br>
GANTOK: My pleasure. It saves me the trouble of burying you. Nobody
beats me at chess. <br>
(Gantok draws his weapon and moves forward, triggering a trap. He falls
down into a pit of ravening skulls.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gantok! <br>
(Gantok gets eaten, then the skulls turn their attention upwards. The
Doctor sonics
the pit closed again. Dorium opens his eyes.) <br>
DORIUM: Hello? Is someone there? Ah, Doctor. Thank God it's you. The
Monks, they turned on me. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid they rather did, a bit. <br>
DORIUM: Give it to me straight, Doctor. How bad are my injuries? <br>
DOCTOR: Well <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHURCHILL: This is absurd. Other worlds,
carnivorous skulls, talking heads. I don't know why I'm listening to
you. <br>
DOCTOR: Because, in another reality, you and I are friends. And you
sense that. Just as you sense there is something wrong with time. <br>
CHURCHILL: You mentioned a woman. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm getting to her. <br>
CHURCHILL: What's she like? Attractive, I assume. <br>
DOCTOR: Hell, in high heels. <br>
CHURCHILL: Tell me more.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DORIUM: Oh, it's not so bad, really, as long as
they get your box the right way up. I got a media-chip fitted in my
head years ago, and the Wi-Fi down here is excellent, so I keep myself
entertained. <br>
DOCTOR: I need to know about the Silence. <br>
DORIUM: Oh. A religious order of great power and discretion. The
sentinels of history, as they like to call themselves. <br>
DOCTOR: And they want me dead. <br>
DORIUM: No, not really. They just don't want you to remain alive. <br>
DOCTOR: That's okay, then. I was a bit worried for a minute there. <br>
DORIUM: You're a man with a long and dangerous past, but your future is
infinitely more terrifying. The Silence believe it must be averted. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, you could've told me all this the last time we met. <br>
DORIUM: It was a busy day and I got beheaded. <br>
DOCTOR: What's so dangerous about my future? <br>
DORIUM: On the Fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, when
no living creature can speak falsely, or fail to answer, a question
will be asked. A question that must never, ever be answered. <br>
DOCTOR: Silence will fall when the question is asked. <br>
DORIUM: Silence must fall would be a better translation. The Silence
are determined the question will never be answered. That the Doctor
will never reach Trenzalore. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't understand. What's it got to do with me? <br>
DORIUM: The first question. The oldest question in the universe, hidden
in plain sight. Would you like to know what it is? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
DORIUM: Are you sure? Very, very sure? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. <br>
DORIUM: Then I shall tell you. But on your own head be it.

Ow! I've fallen on my nose. Have you got wi-fi here? I'm bored already
and my nose is hurting. We all have to die, Doctor, but you more than
most. You do see that, don't you? You know what the question is now.
You do see that you have to die.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHURCHILL: But what was the question? Why did it
mean your death? <br>
DOCTOR: Suppose there was a man who knew a secret. A terrible,
dangerous secret that must never be told. How would you erase that
secret from the world? Destroy it forever, before it can be spoken. <br>
CHURCHILL: If I had to, I'd destroy the man. <br>
DOCTOR: And silence would fall. All the times I've heard those words, I
never realised it was my silence, my death. The Doctor will fall. Why
are we here? <br>
CHURCHILL: This, this is the Senate Room. <br>
DOCTOR: Why did we leave your office? <br>
CHURCHILL: Well, we wanted a stroll, didn't we? <br>
DOCTOR: I think I've been running. Why do you have your revolver? <br>
CHURCHILL: Well, you're dangerous company, Soothsayer. <br>

point. And your death is a fixed point, Doctor. You can't run away from
this. <br>
DOCTOR: Been running all my life. Why should I stop? <br>
DORIUM: Because now you know what's at stake. Why your life must end. <br>
DOCTOR: Not today. <br>
DORIUM: What's the point in delaying? How long have you delayed
already? <br>

people to see. There's always more. I could invent a new colour, save
the Dodo, join the Beatles. Hello, it's me. Get him. Tell him, we're
going out and it's all on me, except for the money and driving. I have
got a time machine, Dorium. It's all still going on. For me, it never
stops. Liz the First is still waiting in a glade to elope with me. I
could help Rose Tyler with her homework. I could go on all of Jack's

AMY: What's wrong with you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm still alive. <br>

the side and the title Area 52.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RORY: You have to put it on, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: An eye patch. What for? <br>
AMY: It's not an eye patch. <br>
RORY: It's an eye drive, sir. It communicates directly with the memory
centres of the brain. Acts as external storage. <br>
AMY: Only thing that works on them. Because no living mind can remember
these things. <br>
RORY: The Silence. <br>
(Held in individual tanks filled with liquid.) <br>
RORY: We've captured over a hundred of them now, all held in this
pyramid. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. I've encountered them before. Always wondered what they
looked like. <br>
AMY: Well, put your eye drive on and you'll retain the information, but
only for as long as you're wearing it. <br>
DOCTOR: The Silence have human servants. They all wear these. <br>
AMY: They'd have to. <br>
RORY: This way. <br>
(The Doctor puts the eye drive on.) <br>
RORY: They seem to be noticing you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, they would. <br>
AMY: So why aren't the human race killing the Silence on sight any
more? <br>
DOCTOR: That was another reality. What are the tanks for? <br>
RORY: They can draw electricity from anything. It's how they attack.
The fluid insulates them. And I really don't like the way they're
looking at you. <br>
DOCTOR: Me neither. <br>
RORY: Ma'am, I'm sure it's nothing, but I should really check this out.
They haven't been this active in a while. You two, upstairs. Check all
the tank seals. Then the floors above. Get everyone checking. <br>
SOLDIER: Sir. <br>
RORY: You go ahead, Ma'am. <br>
AMY: Thank you, Captain Williams. Doctor, this way. <br>
DOCTOR: Captain Williams, nice fellow. What's his first name? <br>
AMY: Captain. Just through here. <br>
DOCTOR: Just give us a moment. Just need to check something, Ma'am. <br>
(The Doctor goes back to Rory. Amy speaks into a hidden microphone on
her
lapel.) <br>
AMY: We're in. He's on his way. <br>
DOCTOR: The loyal soldier, waiting to be noticed. Always the pattern.
Why is that? <br>
RORY: Sorry, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Your boss, you should just ask her out. She likes you. She said
so. <br>
RORY: Really, sir. What did she say? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, she just sort of generally indicated. <br>
RORY: What exactly what did she say? <br>
DOCTOR: She said that you were a Mister Hottie-ness, and that she would
like to go out with you for texting and scones. <br>
RORY: You really haven't done this before, have you? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I haven't. <br>
RORY: See you in a moment, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes. <br>
AMY: Come on, Doctor. Time for you to meet some old friends. <br>
RORY: Attention all personnel. </font></p>

(A lady in a white coat is watching a screen.) <br>
KENT: You were right. Just his presence in the building caused the loop
to extend by nearly four chronons. <br>
(The clock now reads 05:02:57, 58, 59.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hi, honey. I'm home. <br>
RIVER: And what sort of time do you call this? <br>
KOVARIAN: The death of time. The end of time. The end of us all. Oh,
why couldn't you just die? <br>
(She is tied to a chair.) <br>
DOCTOR: Did my best, dear. I showed up. You just can't get the
psychopaths these days. Love what you've done with the pyramids. How
did you score all this? <br>
RIVER: Hallucinogenic lipstick. Works wonders on President Kennedy. And
Cleopatra was a real pushover. <br>
DOCTOR: I always thought so. <br>
RIVER: She mentioned you. <br>
DOCTOR: What did she say? <br>
RIVER: Put down that gun down. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you? <br>
RIVER: Eventually. <br>
KOVARIAN: Oh, they're flirting. Do I have to watch this? <br>
RIVER: It was such a basic mistake, wasn't it, Madame Kovarian. Take a
child, raise her into a perfect psychopath, introduce her to the
Doctor. Who else was I going to fall in love with? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not funny, River. Reality is fatally compromised. Tell me
you understand that. <br>
RIVER: Dinner? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't have the time. Nobody has the time, because as long I'm
alive, time is dying. Because of you, River. <br>
RIVER: Because I refused to kill the man I love. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you love me, do you? Oh, that's sweet of you. Isn't that
sweet. Come here, you. <br>
AMY: Get him! <br>
(Soldiers grab the Doctor.) <br>
RIVER: I'm not a fool, sweetie. I know what happens if we touch. <br>
(The Doctor grabs River's arm.) <br>
RIVER: Get off me. Get him off me! Doctor, no. Let go! Please Doctor,
let go! <br>
WOMAN: It's moving. Time's moving! <br>
(05:03 and counting.) <br>
RIVER: Get him off me! Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, River. It's the only way. <br>
(They flash back to the lakeside, then the soldiers pull him off.) <br>
RIVER: Cuff him. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, why do you always have handcuffs? It's the only way. We're
the opposite poles of the disruption. If we touch, we short out the
differential. Time can begin again. <br>
RIVER: And I'll be by a lakeside killing you. <br>
DOCTOR: And time won't fall apart. The clocks will tick. Reality will
continue. There isn't another way. <br>
RIVER: I didn't say there was, sweetie. <br>
(In the storage area, a Silence puts its hand onto the glass of its
tank, and it begins to crack. Captain Williams notices liquid dripping
through to a lower level.) <br>
RIVER: There are so many theories about you and I, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: Idle gossip. <br>
RIVER: Archaeology. <br>
DOCTOR: Same thing. <br>
RIVER: Am I the woman who marries you, or the woman who murders you? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't want to marry you. <br>
RIVER: I don't want to murder you. <br>
(Amy feels a drop on her head.) <br>
DOCTOR: This is no fun at all. <br>
RIVER: It isn't, is it? <br>
AMY: Doctor, what's that? <br>
DOCTOR: The pyramid above us. How many Silence do you have trapped
inside it? <br>
KOVARIAN: None. They're not trapped. They never have been. They've been
waiting for this, Doctor. For you. <br>
RORY: They're out! All of them. <br>
(And the soldiers are getting slaughtered. Rory bars the door.) <br>
RORY: No one gets in here! Ma'am, my men out there should be able to
lock this down. We have them outnumbered. <br>
KOVARIAN: And you're wearing eye drives based on mine, I think. Oops. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
(Electricity surges through Doctor Kent's eye drive. She screams.) <br>
DOCTOR; Help her! Help her! <br>
(Soldiers are being affected, too.) <br>
AMY: She's dead. <br>
(The Doctor's eye drive tries to zap him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Eye drives off now. Remove them. <br>
(Amy takes the Doctor's eye drive off him, but then her own powers up.)
<br>
KOVARIAN: The Silence would never allow an advantage without taking one
themselves. The effects will vary from person to person. Either death
or debilitating agony. But they will take you all, one by one. <br>
(Madame Kovarian's eye drive starts to zap.) <br>
KOVARIAN: What are you doing? No, it's me. Don't be stupid. You need
me. Stop it. Stop that! <br>
DOCTOR: We could stop this right now, you and I. <br>
KOVARIAN: Get it off me. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, tell her. <br>
AMY: We've been working on something. Just let us show you. <br>
DOCTOR: There's no point. There's nothing you can do. My time is up. <br>
AMY: We're doing this for you! <br>
DOCTOR: Then people are dying for me. I won't thank you for that,
Amelia Pond. <br>
KOVARIAN: Get it <br>
RIVER: Just let us show you. <br>
AMY: Please. Captain Williams, how long do we have? <br>
RORY: Er, a couple of minutes. <br>
RIVER: That's enough. We're going to the Receptor Room right at the top
of the pyramid. I hope you're ready for a climb. <br>
RORY: I'll wait down here, Ma'am. Buy you as much time as I can. <br>
AMY: You have to take your eye drive off. <br>
RORY: Can't do that, Ma'am. Might forget what's coming. <br>
AMY: But it could activate any second. <br>
RORY: It has activated, Ma'am. But I'm of no use to you if I can't
remember. You have to go now, Ma'am. <br>
AMY: Yes. <br>
RORY: Now! <br>
AMY: Yes, thank you, Captain Williams. <br>
(Amy leaves, taking one last look back. Rory fights the pain to keep
his gun hand steady as three Silence break through the door.) <br>
SILENCE: Rory Williams, the man who dies and dies again. Die one last
time and know she will never come back for you. <br>
(Amy lets loose a machine gun at them.) <br>
AMY: Come on, you. Up you get. You all right? <br>
(She takes his eye drive off.) <br>
KOVARIAN: Amy, help me. <br>
(Her eye drive is hanging off.) <br>
AMY: You took my baby from me and hurt her. And now she's all grown up
and she's fine, but I'll never see my baby again. <br>
KOVARIAN: But you'll still save me, though. Because he would, and you'd
never do anything to disappoint your precious Doctor. <br>
RORY: Ma'am, we have to go, now. <br>
AMY: The Doctor is very precious to me, you're right. But do you know
what else he is, Madame Kovarian? Not here. <br>
(Amy puts Kovarian's eye drive back in place.) <br>
AMY: River Song didn't get it all from you, sweetie. <br>
(Amy takes Rory's arm and they leave as Kovarian starts screaming.) <br>
AMY: So, you and me, we should get a drink some time. <br>
RORY: Okay. <br>
AMY: And married. <br>
RORY: Fine.

should be.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's this? Oh, it's as timey-wimey distress beacon. Who built
this? <br>
RIVER: I'm the child of the Tardis. I understand the physics. <br>
DOCTOR: But that's all you've got, a distress beacon. <br>
RIVER: I've been sending out a message. A distress call. Outside the
bubble of our time, the universe is still turning, and I've sent a
message everywhere. To the future and the past, the beginning and the
end of everything. The Doctor is dying. Please, please help. <br>
DOCTOR: River! River, this is ridiculous. That would mean nothing to
anyone. It's insane. Worse, it's stupid. You embarrass me. <br>
AMY: We barricaded the door. We've got a few minutes. Just tell him.
Just tell him, River. <br>
RIVER: Those reports of the sun spots and the solar flares. They're
wrong. There aren't any. It's not the sun, it's you. The sky is full of
a million, million voices saying yes, of course we'll help. You've
touched so many lives, saved so many people. Did you think when your
time came, you'd really have to do more than just ask? You've decided
that the universe is better off without you, but the universe doesn't
agree. <br>
DOCTOR: River, no one can help me. A fixed point has been altered. Time
is disintegrating. <br>
RIVER: I can't let you die. <br>
DOCTOR: But I have to die. <br>
RIVER: Shut up! I can't let you die without knowing you are loved by so
many, and so much, and by no one more than me. <br>
DOCTOR: River, you and I, we know what this means. We are ground zero
of an explosion that will engulf all reality. Billions on billions will
suffer and die. <br>
RIVER: I'll suffer if I have to kill you. <br>
DOCTOR: More than every living thing in the universe? <br>
RIVER: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: River, River, why do you had have to be this? Melody Pond, your
daughter. I hope you're both proud. <br>
RORY: I'm not sure I completely understand. <br>
AMY: We got married and had a kid and that's her. <br>
RORY: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, uncuff me now. Okay, I need a strip of cloth about a foot
long. Anything will do. Never mind. <br>
(The Doctor takes off his bow tie.) <br>
DOCTOR: River, take one end of this. Wrap it around your hand, and hold
it out to me. <br>
RIVER: What am I doing? <br>
DOCTOR: As you're told. Now, we're in the middle of a combat zone, so
we'll have to do the quick version. Captain Williams, say I consent and
gladly give. <br>
RORY: To what? <br>
DOCTOR: Just say it. Please. <br>
RORY: I consent and gladly give. <br>
DOCTOR: Need you to say it too, mother of the bride. <br>
AMY: I consent and gladly give. <br>
DOCTOR: Now River, I'm about to whisper something in your ear, and you
have to remember it very, very carefully, and tell no one what I said. <br>
(He whispers something very short.) <br>
DOCTOR: I just told you my name. Now, there you go, River Song. Melody
Pond. You're the woman who married me. And wife, I have a request. This
world is dying and it's my fault, and I can't bear it another day.
Please, help me. There isn't another way. <br>
RIVER: Then you may kiss the bride. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll make it a good one. <br>
RIVER: You'd better. <br>
(The clock starts moving forward as we go to a white-out and flashbacks
of the events at the lakeside when the Doctor died and was cremated.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: And you are forgiven. Always and completely forgiven. <br>

pterodactyls go away.) <br>

AMY: So where are we? <br>
RIVER: I just climbed out of the Byzantium. You were there. So young.

AMY: How do you think? <br>
RIVER: Well, I don't know unless you tell me. <br>
AMY: I killed someone. Madame Kovarian, in cold blood. <br>
RIVER: In an aborted time line, in a world that never was. <br>
AMY: Yeah, but I can remember it, so it happened, so I did it. What
does that make me now? I need to talk to the Doctor, but I can't now,
can I? <br>
RIVER: If you could talk to him, would it make a difference? <br>
AMY: But he's dead, so, so I can't. <br>
RIVER: Oh, Mother, of course he isn't. <br>
AMY: Not for you, I suppose. You're seeing the younger versions of him
running around, having adventures. <br>
RIVER: Yeah, I am. But that's not what I mean. <br>
AMY: Then what do you mean? <br>
RIVER: Okay. I'm going to tell you what I probably shouldn't. The
Doctor's last secret. Don't you want to know what he whispered in my
ear? <br>
AMY: He whispered his name. <br>
RIVER: Not his name, no. <br>
AMY: Yes, it was. He said it was. <br>
RIVER: Rule One? <br>
AMY: The Doctor lies. <br>
RIVER: So do I, all the time. Have to. Spoilers. Pretending I don't
know you're my mother, pretending I don't recognise a space suit in
Florida. <br>
AMY: What did he whisper in your ear? <br>
RIVER: Oh, that man. He's always one step ahead of everyone. Always a
plan. <br>
AMY: River, what did he tell you? River. <br>

garden.) <br>
RORY: Hey. What? <br>
AMY: He's not dead. He's not dead. <br>
RORY: Are you sure, River? Are you really, properly sure? <br>
