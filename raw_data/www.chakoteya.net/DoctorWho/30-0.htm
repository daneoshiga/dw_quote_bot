sounds and a ship's bow crashes through the side of the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: What? What? <br>
(A ship's bell sounds, and he picks up life belt that has the name
Titanic on it.) <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
(The Doctor returns to the console and adjusts the controls. The Tardis
walls reform, pushing the ship back outside. Then he materialises
inside the ship, next to a board detailing a list of shipping
companies. The fog horn is sounding again.)

buffet. A band plays a slow version of Jingle Bells. Around the room
are golden skinned statues of male angels. One moves as the Doctor
walks past. Then he spots a small red-skinned alien in a dinner jacket,
and goes to a window.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
TANNOY: Attention all passengers. The Titanic is now in orbit above Sol
Three, also known as Earth. Population, Human. Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Christmas.

Edwardian era uniforms, and the bridge is elegantly period, but the
equipment is
hi-tech. Are we in for Robots of Death meets Terminus, or a version of
Douglas Adams' Starship Titanic?) <br>
CAPTAIN: Nice and steady. Good work, Mister Cavill. And maintain
position. Now then, gentlemen, according to the traditions of the
planet below, Christmas is a time of celebration. I think you might be
entitled to a tot of rum. Just the one. Off you go. I'll keep watch. <br>
CAVILL: Sir. <br>
(The helmsman salutes and leaves, followed by others. Just the youngest
officer remains.) <br>
CAPTAIN: And you. What was it? <br>
FRAME: Midshipman Frame, sir. Only just qualified, sir. First trip out.
<br>
CAPTAIN: Then you can stand down, Midshipman. <br>
FRAME: Er, but, er, regulations say the bridge has to be staffed by two
crewmembers at any one time, sir. <br>
CAPTAIN: Well said. Very good. Well, it should be nice and quiet. It's
only a level five planet down below. They don't even know we're here.
Silent Night, I believe they call it. A silent night. </font></p>

Wonderland. The Doctor has changed into dinner jacket and bow tie.) <br>
STEWARD: Merry Christmas, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Merry Christmas. <br>

his mobile phone.) <br>
SLADE: It's not a holiday for me, not while I've still got my vone. Now
do as I say and sell. <br>

DOCTOR: Evening. Passenger fifty seven. Terrible memory. Remind me. You
would be? <br>
HOST: Information. Heavenly Host supplying tourist information. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, so, tell me, because I'm an idiot, where are we from? <br>
HOST: Information. The Titanic is en route from the planet Sto in the
Cassavalian Belt. The purpose of the cruise is to experience primitive
cultures. <br>
DOCTOR: Titanic. Who thought of the name? <br>
HOST: Information. It was chosen as the most famous vessel of the
planet Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Did they tell you why it was famous? <br>
HOST: Information. All designations are chosen by Mister Max Capricorn,
president of Max, Max, Max <br>
(The Host twitches and its voice pitch rises. The Steward notices and
hurries over.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, bit of a glitch. <br>
STEWARD: It's all right, sir, we can handle this. <br>
(Two more officers arrive and they switch off the Host before carrying
it away.) <br>
STEWARD: Software problem, that's all. Leave it with us, sir. Merry
Christmas. That's another one down. What's going on with these
things?&nbsp; </font></p>

woman, she asked the Host to fix her necklace. It almost broke her
neck. In First Class. <br>

got into them. Some kind of bug. <br>
(Another Host is brought in on a forklift.) <br>

Earth antique. <br>
ASTRID: I'm sorry, sir. <br>
(Yes, that is Kylie Minogue.) <br>
SLADE: You'll be sorry when it comes off your wages, sweetheart.
Staffed by idiots. No wonder Max Capricorn's going down the drain. <br>
(Slade leaves. The Doctor stoops to help.) <br>
DOCTOR: Careful. There we go. <br>
ASTRID: Thank you, sir. I can manage. <br>
DOCTOR: I never said you couldn't. I'm the Doctor, by the way. <br>
ASTRID: Astrid, sir. Astrid Peth. <br>
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Astrid Peth. Merry Christmas. <br>
ASTRID: Merry Christmas, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Just Doctor, not sir. <br>
ASTRID: You enjoying the cruise? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, yeah, I suppose. I don't know. It doesn't quite work, a
cruise on your own. <br>
ASTRID: You're not with anyone? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, just me. Just, er, used to be but, er, no. What about
you? Long way from home, Planet Sto. <br>
ASTRID: Doesn't feel that different. I spent three years working at the
spaceport diner, travelled all the way here and I'm still waiting on
tables. <br>
DOCTOR: No shore leave? <br>
ASTRID: We're not allowed. They can't afford the insurance. I just
wanted to try it, just once. I used to watch the ships heading out to
the stars and I always dreamt of. It sounds daft. <br>
DOCTOR: You dreamt of another sky. New sun, new air, new life. A whole
universe teeming with life. Why stand still when there're all that life
out there? <br>
ASTRID: So, you travel a lot? <br>
DOCTOR: All the time. Just for fun. Well, that's the plan. Never quite
works. <br>
ASTRID: Must be rich, though. <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't got a penny. Stowaway. <br>
ASTRID: Kidding. <br>
DOCTOR: Seriously. <br>
ASTRID: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. <br>
ASTRID: How did you get on board? <br>
DOCTOR: Accident. I've got this, sort of, ship thing. I was just
rebuilding her. Left the defences down. Bumped into the Titanic. Here I
am. Bit of a party. I thought, why not? <br>
ASTRID: I should report you. <br>
DOCTOR: Go on then. <br>
ASTRID: I'll get you a drink on the house. <br>
(Over at another table, a bunch of toffs are laughing at a large woman
in a purple cowboy outfit and her equally well padded companion. The
Doctor joins them.) <br>
MORVIN: (the man) Just ignore them. <br>
DOCTOR: Something's tickled them. <br>
FOON: (the woman) They told us it was fancy dress. Very funny, I'm
sure. <br>
MORVIN: They're just picking on us because we haven't paid. We won our
tickets in a competition. <br>
FOON: I had to name the five husbands of Joofie Crystalle in By the
Light of the Asteroid. Did you ever watch By the Light of the Asteroid?
<br>
DOCTOR: Is that the one with the twins? <br>
FOON: That's it. Oh, it's marvellous. <br>
MORVIN: But we're not good enough for that lot. They think we should be
in steerage. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, can't have that, can we? <br>
(With his back towards the toffs, the Doctor aims his sonic screwdriver
at the champagne bottle in the bucket on their table. The cork pops
out, spraying their expensive clothes with alcohol.) <br>
FOON: Did you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe. <br>
FOON: We like you. <br>
MORVIN: We do. I'm Morvin Van Hoff. This is my good woman, Foon. <br>
DOCTOR: Foon. Hello, I'm the Doctor. <br>
FOON: Oh, I'm going to need a Doctor, time I've finished with that
buffet. Have a buffalo wing. They must be enormous, these buffalo. So
many wings. <br>
TANNOY: Attention please. Shore leave tickets Red Six Seven now
activated. Red Six Seven. <br>
FOON: Red Six Seven. That's us. Are you Red Six Seven? <br>

FRAME: Picking up a meteoroid shower portside, bearing west fifty six

would. <br>
(Very Blake's 7, another BBC sci fi hit.) <br>
ASTRID: I'll get the sack. <br>
DOCTOR: Brand new sky. <br>
COPPER: To repeat, I am Mister Copper, the ship's historian, and I
shall be taking you to old London town in the country of UK, ruled over
by good King Wenceslas. Now, human beings worship the great god Santa,
a creature with fearsome claws, and his wife Mary. And every Christmas
Eve, the people of UK go to war with the country of Turkey. They then
eat the Turkey people for Christmas dinner like savages. <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. Sorry, sorry, but, er, where did you get all this
from? <br>
COPPER: Well, I have a first class degree in Earthonomics. Now, stand
by. <br>

DOCTOR: Okay, Bannakaffalatta. But it's Christmas Eve down there. Late
night shopping, tons of people. He's like a talking conker. No offence,
but you'll cause a riot because the streets are going to be packed with
shoppers and parties and

DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
COPPER: Now, spending money. I have a credit card in Earth currency if
you want to buy trinkets, or stockings, or the local delicacy, which is
known as beef. But don't stray too far, it could be dangerous. Any day
now they start boxing. <br>
BANNAKAFFALATTA: Very good. <br>
DOCTOR: It should be full. It should be busy. Something's wrong. <br>
ASTRID: But it's beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Do you think so? It's just a street. The pyramids are
beautiful, and New Zealand. <br>
ASTRID: But it's a different planet. I'm standing on a different
planet. There's concrete and shops. Alien shops. Real alien shops!
Look, no stars in the sky. And it smells. It stinks! Oh, this is
amazing. Thank you! <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah? Come on then, let's have a look. <br>
(Next to the news stand is a billboard for The Examiner, headline -
London Deserted. The proprietor has a Union Flag behind him. This is
Bernard Cribbins, once a companion of the Peter Cushing Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, there. Sorry, obvious question, but where's everybody
gone? <br>
WILF: Oh ho, scared! <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Yes. Scared of what? <br>
WILF: Where've you been living? London at Christmas? Not safe, is it. <br>
DOCTOR: Why?&nbsp;<br>
WILF: Well, it's them, up above. Look, Christmas before last we had
that big bloody spaceship, everyone standing on a roof. And then last
year, that Christmas Star electrocuting all over the place, draining
the Thames. <br>
ASTRID: This place is amazing. <br>
WILF: And this year, Lord knows what. So, everybody's scarpered. Gone
to the country. All except me and Her Majesty. <br>
NICHOLAS WITCHELL [on TV]: Her Majesty the Queen has confirmed that
she'll be staying in Buckingham Palace throughout the festive season to
show the people of London, and the world, that there's nothing to fear.
<br>
WILF: God bless her. We stand vigil. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, between you and me, I think her Majesty's got it right.
Far as I know, this year, nothing to worry about. <br>

ASTRID: They've stopped. <br>
BANNAKAFFALATTA: Gone away? <br>
DOCTOR: Why would they give up? <br>
SLADE: Never mind that. Keep coming. <br>
DOCTOR: Where have they gone? Where are the Host? <br>
COPPER: I'm afraid we've forgotten the traditions of Christmas. That

HOST: Information. Kill. <br>
(The Host remove their haloes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Arm yourself, all of you. <br>
(Everyone on the bridge grabs a bit of pipe and uses it as a bat to
send the haloes flying, but one cuts the Doctor's arm and another
injures Copper's side.) <br>
ASTRID: I can't. <br>
BANNAKAFFALATTA: Bannakaffalatta stop. Bannakaffalatta proud.
Bannakaffalatta cyborg! <br>
(He lifts his shirt and sends out an energy pulse. It short-circuits
the Host, sending them plummeting down into the engine core, except
one that lands on the catwalk behind the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Electromagnetic pulse took out the robotics. Oh,
Bannakaffalatta, that was brilliant! <br>
(Bannakaffalatta collapses.) <br>
ASTRID: He's used all his power. <br>
BANNAKAFFALATTA: Did good? <br>
ASTRID: You saved our lives. <br>
BANNAKAFFALATTA: Bannakaffalatta happy. <br>
ASTRID: We can recharge you. Get you to a power point and just plug you
in. <br>
BANNAKAFFALATTA: Too late. <br>
ASTRID: No, but you got to get me that drink, remember? <br>
BANNAKAFFALATTA: Pretty girl. <br>
(Bannakaffalatta dies. Astrid starts to fasten his shirt, but Copper
reaches for a component.) <br>
COPPER: I'm sorry. Forgive me. <br>
ASTRID: Leave him alone. <br>
COPPER: It's the EMP transmitter. He'd want us to use it. I used to
sell these things. They'd always give me a bed for the night in the
cyborg caravans. They're good people. But if we can recharge it, we can
use it as a weapon against the rest of the Host. Bannakaffalatta might
have saved us all. <br>
SLADE: Do you think? Try telling him that. <br>
(The Host that landed behind the Doctor is moving.) <br>
HOST: Information. Reboot. <br>
SLADE: Use the EMP! <br>
COPPER: It's dead. It's dead. <br>
ASTRID: It's got to have emergency <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Hold on. Override loophole. Security protocol ten.
Six six six. Er, twenty one, four, five, six, seven, eight. I
don't know, forty two? Er, one! <br>
HOST: Information. State request. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Right. You've been ordered to kill the survivors, but
why? <br>
HOST: Information. No witnesses. <br>
DOCTOR: But this ship's going to fall on the Earth and kill everyone.
The human race have nothing to do with the Titanic, so that contravenes
your orders, yes? <br>
HOST: Information. Incorrect. <br>
DOCTOR: But why do you want to destroy the Earth? <br>
HOST: Information. It is the plan. <br>
DOCTOR: What plan? <br>
HOST: Information. Protocol grants you only three questions. These
three questions have been used. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you could have warned me. <br>
HOST: Information. Now you will die. <br>
(As the Host raises its halo, it is lassoed from behind.) <br>
FOON: You're coming with me. <br>
(Foon jumps over the side, dragging the Host after her.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>

DOCTOR: No more.

Once you're there, Mister Copper, you've got staff access to the
computer. Try to find a way of transmitting an SOS. Astrid, you're in
charge of this. (the EMP transmitter) Once it's powered up, it'll take
out a Host within fifty yards but then it needs sixty seconds to

ASTRID: I'm sort of unemployed now. I was thinking the blue box is kind
of small, but I could squeeze in it, like a stowaway. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not always safe. <br>
ASTRID: So you need someone to take care of you. I've got no one back
on Sto. No family, just me. So what do you think? Can I come with you? <br>

survivors but survivors must therefore be passengers or staff, but not
me. I'm not a passenger. I'm not staff. Go on, scan me. You must have
bio-records. No such person on board. I don't exist, therefore you
can't kill me. Therefore, I'm a stowaway, and stowaways should be
arrested and taken to the nearest figure of authority. And I reckon the

CAPRICORN: Oh, ho, ho, the office joker. I like a funny man. No one's
been funny with me for years. <br>

CAPRICORN: A hundred and seventy six years of running the company have
taken their toll. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah but, nice wheels. <br>
CAPRICORN: No, a life support system, in a society that despises
cyborgs. I've had to hide away for years, running the company by
hologram. Host, situation report. <br>
HOST: Information. Titanic is still in orbit. <br>
CAPRICORN: Let me see. We should have crashed by now. What's gone
wrong? The engines are still running! They should have stopped! <br>

What's the Earth got to do with it? <br>

wait, wait, wait. I can work it out. It's like a task. I'm your
apprentice. Just watch me. So, business is failing and you wreck the
ship so that makes things even worse. Oh, yes! No. Yes. The business
isn't failing, it's failed. Past tense. <br>
CAPRICORN: My own board voted me out. Stabbed me in the back. <br>
DOCTOR: If you had a back. So, you scupper the ship, wipe out any
survivors just in case anyone's rumbled you and the board find their
shares halved in value. Oh, but that's not enough. No. Because if a Max
Capricorn ship hits the Earth, it destroys an entire planet. Outrage
back home. Scandal! The business is wiped out. <br>
CAPRICORN: And the whole board thrown in jail for mass murder. <br>
DOCTOR: While you sit there, safe inside the impact chamber. <br>
CAPRICORN: I have men waiting to retrieve me from the ruins and enough
off-world accounts to retire me to the beaches of Penhaxico Two, where
the ladies, so I'm told, are very fond of metal. <br>
DOCTOR: So that's the plan. A retirement plan. Two thousand people on
this ship, six billion underneath us, all of them slaughtered, and why?
Because Max Capricorn is a loser. <br>
