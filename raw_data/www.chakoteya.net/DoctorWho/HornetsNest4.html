<br>ANNOUNCER: (Tom Baker) Doctor Who. Hornets' Nest. A Sting In The Tale, by Paul Magrs. Starring Tom Baker and Richard Franklin.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: I stepped from the TARDIS into darkness. The ground was
frozen hard and the very air tingled with cold. I had arrived at a vast
woodland deep in the heart of Winter - far, far back in Earth's past.
The forest around me creaked and groaned with the weight from the
accumulated snow. The light from the pen torch I had brought with me
was feeble at best, probing gingerly into the endless shadows. It
seemed so beknighted, and so denuded of life, and yet the TARDIS's
instruments suggested a place teeming with life forms, millions of
them, and the area of the country buzzing with activity. So where were
they? Was everyone hibernating? Did the whole of England sleep away the
endless Winters of the Dark Ages?<br>
MIKE YATES: Are you sure you weren't back in Norfolk?<br>
THE DOCTOR: I was in quite a different time and place, Mike. Further North, much further back.<br>
MIKE YATES: And how had you found your way there this time?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Another written account I had found, this time a record in
the TARDIS's data banks, concerning a strange occurrence at Tilling
Abbey. Long gone by the Twenty-First Century, the abbey was once a
thriving centre of religious observance for womenfolk. But something
happened there in the year Ten Thirty-Nine, and for years afterwards
stories circulated of rabid dogs and demonic flying insects. If I was
looking for the earliest indication of hornet life on the planet, this
seemed as likely a lead as any. The TARDIS, I hoped, had had the good
sense to drop me close by. Of course, by springing upon the ladies of
the abbey unexpected I had no idea what kind of a reception I'd receive.<br>
MIKE YATES: Cordial, one would hope.<br>
THE DOCTOR: It was anything but, I'm afraid, Mike.<br>
MIKE YATES: Can be unpredictable, nuns.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mm.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Heading in what the readout suggested was the
right direction, I felt as though I was some ethereal spirit of
Midwinter misrule, crunching through the frosty undergrowth and making
for home in the middle of the night. Perhaps I was careless, too
reckless, crashing through the branches. The twiggy fingers of the
trees tugging at my scarf and trying to snare me. I believe I even
sang, yes, loudly, in order to keep myself company. (Singing) "Good
King Wenceslas looked out, on the Feast of Stephen, mark my pages rub
my feet, though the frogs are cruel..." You get the idea. On
reflection, it was inevitable that my noisy approach would be noted. I
was wandering blithely into the trap of expert hunters. As the
woodlands began to thin out I caught a glimpse of pale fields dense
with snow rising before me. My hearts leapt up inside me at the sight
of all that open land dozing beneath the full moon. I flung myself at
the deep fields of snow, feeling that I had triumphed somehow against
the very soul of the forest, which had tried so hard to snag and drag
me backwards. And yet, the whole time I had been under the creaking
canopy, someone had been watching my back...<br>
(Sounds of a pack of barking dogs begin to be heard.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) ... monitoring my noisy presence, waiting for
me to trip. Now I was in the open fields, they came after me, keen not
to lose their newfound prey. They had to bring me down. Because I was
new in that endless dark forest, the cold hadn't yet got to me. I was a
warm, juicy morsel in a frigid landscape. So I could hardly escape the
notice of the starving animal hordes. The undergrowth bristled, the
frozen grasses were rustling. I started to run. My boots churned up
great swathes of heavy snow as I tore headlong into the field. My
progress was made all the more difficult by a steep gradient. I was
running up a hill towards - I hoped - the building that the TARDIS had
noted. I turned. I paused and I turned, just as ... more of those
terrible howls rent the air, a ghastly frenedy of hungry music. I
blinked, shaking the snow out of my hair and my scarf, and I flailed my
pathetic torch-light about, trying to illumine the way I had come.
There was a flash of hard, flinty eyes, multiple pairs, some closer
than others, one pair very close indeed.<br>
(Growling.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I was frozen to the spot as the owner broke
from the pack and came bounding through my furrowed snow-tracks. I fell
backwards with a great cry as the hound flung herself upon me...<br>
(Snarling.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Her great slavering jaws lavished red-hot
slobber all over me. The attack stopped as suddenly as it had begun. A
louder, more resolent cry tore through the night, and my assailant
yelped resentfully. She was letting me go. I staggered backwards into
the snow with alacrity, still covered in hot slobber.<br>
(Growls.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The creature stared at me with blazing hatred.
For a second our eyes locked, and then incredibly, she turned and ran,
pelting back into the woods. Ahead of me, further up the hill, rose
human cries.<br>
<br>
THE SISTER: He's here. We've got him. Look! It has spared him.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I turned to see three newcomers, in furs even
heavier and more cumbersome than the hounds' winter coat, hastening
down the snowy slope towards me. They carried flaming torches, whose
golden light was a very welcome sight as I picked myself up to face
them.<br>
<br>
THE SISTER: What are you doing out here alone? Didn't you know about the wild hounds?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) She let down her hood in order to speak to me,
and I was amazed to see the very beautiful face of a young woman
creased with irritation as she questioned me. I stammered an apology
which she waved brusquely away. They more or less dragged me up the
rest of the hill. We crested the brow, and the moon shone fully upon
the edifice before us. Their home. It was a vast impregnable city of
stone, baleful and high above a world of wintry trees. A nunnery, deep
in the heart of the tangled countryside.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: I say, I wonder if you'd have a hot toddy on the go, or
whatever passes for refreshment these days up there at that nunnery of
yours?<br>
THE SISTER: The Reverend Mother will want to see you.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) As long as I got my hot toddy, it didn't matter
what she asked me. However, once indoors and peering down at a bowl of
barley soup with rancid butter floating in it, I couldn't help but be
... disappointed. It wasn't quite the brew I had fondly imagined. The
nuns told me that I was somewhere in Northumbria, a wild and unsettled
place, even in your time, Mike. Back then it was a wilderness. As I
pretended to be enjoying the refreshments enormously, I was aware in
the guttering candlelight of the other nuns hovering at my back. They
were both wary of and fascinated by me. They had probably never seen
anything like me before. And then, I noticed something most unexpected.
At close quarters, their combined breath carried the unmistakable tang
of ... whisky. I felt almost woozy just being in the same room as them.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Run your own distillery here, do you? Useful source of income, I dare say.<br>
THE SISTER: The fermentation of grain is an art, handed down through generations of our sisterhood.<br>
THE DOCTOR: It beats macramé hands down - do you all imbibe, huh? Novel.<br>
THE SISTER: Not everyone likes the taste, but for those of us who do, it keeps the cold at bay.<br>
THE DOCTOR: And cheers many a long evening, I dare say.<br>
THE SISTER: Why were you trekking through the winter woods alone?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Well, I like to wander, you know. I don't really need a
reason to go rambling about anywhere and the weather rarely bothers me.
However, I confess, I am actually on a quest.<br>
THE NUN: He seeks the Divinity, sister.<br>
THE SISTER: I thought so. Guard the sanctum. Whoever sent you, man, take
word back that we will never give up that which we protect and honour.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I can assure you nobody sent me. But what is this thing you protect?<br>
THE SISTER: Feign what ignorance you will. Everyone in this area knows
of our Mother Superior, and the light that shines in her eyes.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Really? And how long has that been going on for?<br>
THE SISTER: She was rescued by the sisters three months ago. They found
her wandering in the woods alone, save for the tiny souls dancing in
the centres of her eyes.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I think you'd better let me see her.<br>
THE SISTER: We do not grant audiences with her.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Trust me, I'm a Doctor, Sister, and I have a very nasty
feeling that I know more about your Mother Superior than you do,
probably more than she knows about herself, in fact.<br>
THE NUN: Sister, night is falling. First watch have seen the attackers starting to gather outside.<br>
THE SISTER: You know what to do. Marshall the sisters. Our defences grow weaker each day.<br>
THE DOCTOR: More of those dogs we heard outside?<br>
THE SISTER: It's been three months now. The spirit to defend remains high, but I fear our sisters grow tired in the body.<br>
THE DOCTOR: You said it was three months since you rescued your Mother Superior.<br>
THE SISTER: They are the Devil's hounds, sent to test our faith.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Sister, I implore you. Let me speak with your Mother
Superior. I'm here on the trail of an evil force, a malignant entity
formed from the souls of many millions of creatures, and I believe that
you all might be somehow caught up in it.<br>
THE SISTER: Very well. Beware, Doctor. The sanctum is both barred and guarded, so you alone can do no harm.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) She led me down narrow passageways to a room at
the very heart of the abbey, an inner sanctum, outside of which stood
two nuns carrying hefty spears. Heavy locks were pulled back with
effort, the door opened, and I walked in. I've been brought before some
very important leaders and heads of state in my time, Mike. I have
visited some extremely interesting Supreme Beings in their magnificent
thronerooms. They've always had quite a lot to say for themselves. I
wasn't quite sure what to think at
first when I was brought before the Abbess. Were the sisters having a
joke with me? Perhaps. I approached, very cautiously. The light was
smoky and dim. The Mother Superior was hunched upon the floor, her
wimple all awry. Rather messy for a Reverend Mother, I remember
thinking. Not much decorum as she received a stranger in her room. I
said: "Hello, my dear. Are you unwell?" And then I saw her. She raised
her dewy nose with a questioning air. Her whiskers trembled with
wariness. She was snuffling, trying to work out whether I was a friend
or foe. "It's all right. It's all right, Mother Superior." The divinity
guarded by the sisters answered me.<br>
(Pig grunting.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) She was a pig. Just an ordinary pig, sitting
there. Rather confused, rather out of her element. She had no idea why
the sisters revered her so. I was pretty puzzled myself. I sat
carefully, quietly, in front of the pig, mesmerising her gently. Or at
least, having a go. I stared into her eyes, and she started back into
mine.<br>
(Multiple buzzing sounds of the swarm begin to be heard.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I remembered what the sister had said, about
the dancing lights, the brilliance in her eyes, and I could see that
brilliance now. I had seen it before. Oh yes. I had heard that noise
before. The humming drone. But now it was slightly different, more
rarefied, almost musical. The pig was a rare beast. Within her I was
sure lay the Queen of the hive, the Queen in all her glory, with her
servants and workers somewhere deep inside this primitive creature,
glaring back at me with, what? Hatred? Surprise?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh no, my dear, you don't get me. I can feel you probing,
twitching, eager to be out of your porcine prison. (Laugh.) Why are you
stuck there? That's the question, eh?<br>
.<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I backed away very gradually. The pig stared
back, implacable, possessed. Quite terrifying in her beatific
blankness. I called the sisters to let me out again.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Quite charming, your Mother Superior. Doesn't say much though, does she?<br>
THE SISTER: She does not need to say much. Her eyes. Did you not see the love that is in her eyes? The dancing lights.<br>
THE DOCTOR: You don't know what you've brought into your abbey.<br>
THE SISTER: She is our Divinity.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Later that afternoon, I was a witness to the
stresses that these poor girls were under as the hounds attacked in
full force. Joining them on the battlements, I watched the Sun burn
across the top of the forest canopy causing deathly shadows to lengthen
across the snow.<br>
(Barking dogs begin to be heard)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Soon the hounds came darting out of the
undergrowth, gnashing, and sending their bellowing cries up to the
heavens. I should hardly have been surprised by now, but the nuns had
slingshots, and bows and arrows, and great cauldrons for tipping
boiling oil off the battlements onto intruders. I was most impressed by
how they all kept their heads. One strapping girl quite
matter-of-factly sent blazing arrows arching through the snowy air. I
was full of admiration. I studied the beasts as they came
creeping towards the castle, and soon picked out the leader of their
pack, a huge brute, thick with muscle and winter coat. A wolf hound
with savage amber eyes. And they all had a demeanour I recognised - a
detached, almost haunted air of single-minded determination.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Sister, these dogs are possessed by the same beings as your Mother Superior.<br>
THE SISTER: You blaspheme against the Reverend Mother.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Your Reverend Mother is possessed by a terrible power.<br>
THE SISTER: We are being tested. The strength of our faith is evinced by the protection we give our most holy resident.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I'm sorry, but you are wrong. This isn't to do with your
faith. It's an alien force, something unknown on Earth. A swarm of
creatures who can inhabit and possess almost anything. People, inanimate objects, pigs.<br>
THE SISTER: Enough. <br>THE
DOCTOR: I have come a very long way. I have learnt much about them. I
have faced these creatures again and again. That pig was not sent to
enlighten you spiritually, and those dogs outside are not there to test
your faith. It is my belief that you have something they want very
badly, and they won't stop until they get it back.<br>THE SISTER: You believe there is some form of pest inside the hounds, controlling them?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes. Exactly.<br>
THE SISTER: The Devil is legion. He is lord of the insect world. You merely confirm my beliefs, Doctor.<br>
THE NUN: Sister!<br>
THE DOCTOR: I saw with a shock that the nun's robes had been torn. Her flesh had been gashed by savage claws.<br>
THE NUN: Sister, we are being invaded.<br>
THE SISTER: How is this possible? What have they done?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The younger nun almost collapsed in a dead faint. I ran to her and saw how much blood she had lost.<br>
<br>
THE NUN: They came in through the kitchens. We were distracted. They
are too clever, too strong. We have bolted the inner doors, but ...
they are here.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) She fell unconscious into my arms.<br>
<br>
THE SISTER: We are doomed.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Not necessarily. If we let them get what they want, I can try to lead them away from this place.<br>
THE SISTER: No, Doctor. You cannot destroy our faith. You might be the
Devil himself as far as we know. I must protect the Reverend Mother.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) As she raced to the inner sanctum, I made my
way to the main gates to watch their failing defences. The nuns worked
in quiet concert as they tried to bolster the gates, piling pews and
anything heavy that came to hand against the wooden doors.<br>
(Dogs barking.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) But I could hear the avid shrieking of the
dogs. Tonight they would be in, no matter what. They were making a
final desperate assault on the nunnery. Suddenly, with regret, I knew
that this had to run its course. I had seen inside the eyes of the
possessed pig in the inner sanctum, and I knew that the hornet soldiers
were inside these dogs, desperate to get their Queen back. I couldn't
stop them, nobody could, Mike. When the main door to the entrance hall
eventually cracked into splinters, the gigantic male wolf hound came
bounding and slavering into our midst.<br>
(Growling.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The nuns fled deeper into their home towards
the inner sanctum, but nothing could hold the dogs back. As if
following the scent of a fox, they bounded as one down the echoing
passageways, flowing towards their Queen like water channeling to the
sea.<br>
(Barking of many hounds.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I allowed myself to be carried along with them,
to a scene of carnage, where dogs leapt upon nuns and took them in
their jaws, shaking them like old rags.<br>
(Snarling and barking.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The abbey was turning into a slaughterhouse
before my eyes. Until one of the sisters, her faith clearly tested to
the limit, pulled back the locks and admitted them. The leader of the
pack, the wolf hound, went first. He gave a snarl of horrible triumph
as he padded into the holy of holies. I held my breath and followed as
quietly as I possibly could. In the dimly-lit inner sanctum, I heard
the low deadly growl of the wolf hound, his claws scraped on the cold
stone floor. His prey knew she was discovered. From the far end of the
room there came a whimper, a terrified squeal, as the pig scented the
creature coming her way. I squinted into the darkness, and saw her
brilliant eyes widen with fear. A hound like that would make easy work
of a helpless sow. One great snap of his slavering chops ... Little
pig, little pig, let me come in - I'll huff and I'll puff. But the
Mother Superior shrugged off her wimple and bravely drew herself up to
her fullest height, her snout quivered, but she stood her ground as the
wolf hound approached. She was quite on her own. Her sisters were busy
elsewhere, fighting for their lives. This was no ordinary pig, Mike.
Even the wolf hound was starting to realise that. He slobbered and
growled and licked his foaming lips. He could smell something unique
about this pig. Within the pig lay his objective, his Queen. He knew
she was there. The creatures buzzing inside his primitive brain, they
knew they had found what they had come for. Could it be? Yes, it could.
I watched as the pig stared back at the deadly hound, transfixing him
with her stare. I heard and felt the buzz of the hornets filling the
stonewalled room, sawing at my senses.<br>
(Buzzing of many insects.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I saw the hornets pouring out of their humble
hostess. Her nostrils and ears and eye ducts suddenly teemed with their
agitated bodies, which emerged and grew into billows of smoke. The tiny
bodies swirled like some ghastly incense in that holy place. Even as I
tell you about it, Mike, it seemed like some awful dream. But I assure
you it's all true, every weird moment of it. Now it was the wolf
hound's turn to whimper as the lowlier hornets inside his own form
recognised what was emerging now. Here came the Queen, a flash of
liquid gold. Very little pomp and circumstance, but we knew it was her,
protected in the eye of the storm as she exited the Reverend Mother.
The pig slumped to the ground, insensible, vacant eyed. The wolf hound
whimpered tremulously as the storm entered him. He yelped with
pleasurable fear as the Queen and her guards and her most loyal
intimate hundreds poured into his savage frame. From one primitive form
into another. I wondered briefly why the nuns had escaped possession by
the hornets. Why had the Queen stayed inside a mere pig? As one of the
sisters cowered next to me, her warm anxious breath on my face, I
realised all of a sudden what the answer was. The holy sisters were
simply fizzing with it, with the grain they fermented and the tipple
they imbibed to keep away the winter chill. But could it be true? Was
every one of the human shells that the swarm inhabited a teetotaler?
And was the byproduct of botanical fermentation really a deterrent to
this inexorable alien swarm? I had no time to mull it over now. The
hound's jaws clashed as he whirled around and about. The swarm was
completely within him now. The same evil intelligence glowed within his
eyes. He bounded past me with a snicker of contempt, it seemed. As he
burst into the hall, where the doughty nuns were still fighting to
protect their abbey, I saw the other dogs raise their heads in urgent
inquiry. They seemed satisfied then. The Queen had been rescued by her
drones. A wonderful reunion was occurring. As the wolf hound turned to
gather his forces, I watched clouds of insects rise from the bodies of
the dogs. They emerged, and gathered in the air like smoke.<br>
<br>
(Buzzing of insects.)<br>
THE SISTER: What is happening? The Mother - did you save the Reverend Mother?<br>
THE DOCTOR: She's alive. But the light in her eyes is out, I'm afraid. She's just a humble pig once more.<br>
THE SISTER: Those insects. Where do they come from? Are they attacking the wolf hound? Is this the Devil come to claim his own?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) We watched them as the swarm flowed into the
wolf hound. Every single hornet in this time and place rallied to the
host body where the Queen had taken up residence.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Got them!<br>
THE SISTER: What? What are you saying?<br>
THE DOCTOR: I've got them! They're all in one place, inside one body. I can take them away from here.<br>
THE SISTER: You can free our abbey of this scourge?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) That was indeed my objective, but what could I
possibly do to draw the wolf hound after me, away from this place? And
then in a blinding flash I realised. Do you remember, Mike, my visit to
the general store in Blandford some eight hundred years later? Well, a
crumpled packet of aniseed balls still remained in my jacket pocket,
delicious and licoricey, and just the kind of thing to drive a true
doggie bananas. I held them in front of me, like a prize. The wild pack
swayed and sniffed the air. I watched the pack captain's pupils dilate
as he was frozen by desire for a few fraught seconds. The savaged nuns
around him looked perplexed. It was long enough for me to dart away, to
pelt down the stone corridor and back to the ruined main entrance. I
was running out on them all, I was leaving the surviving nuns to their
own devices, but I was taking the pack leader with me. The gigantic
dog, his eyes big as saucers, came romping after me towards the
drawbridge. His paws banged hard on the wooden boards. He bayed at the
moon as we emerged into the open air, and I ran for all I was worth,
the half pound of fennel-scented sweets held aloft before me, so that
their tantalising scent streamed out and kept him coming. My hearts
were pounding fit to burst by the time I was under the forest canopy
again. My noisy flight woke creatures of all kinds as I thrust myself
between the close-grown trees. I hoped that I could find the TARDIS
again. The wolf hound bayed like fury, bounding through the woods
almost at my heels, and within his crazed mind, I had the hornets,
every single one of them. I was luring them, I was winning, I had them
in my grasp at last. And then, ahead of me, bright blue, beautiful in
the inky dark night, her windows and lamp lit up a fierce ice-white,
the TARDIS! I clattered against the lock with my key, my fingers numbed
by cold. I turned to see how far behind my pursuer was, and at that
moment he leapt at me. Flinging up both arms in defence I toppled
backwards into the ship. He tore at my hands, biting hard into the
nerves of one, so that I felt the flesh ripping. He then bounded over
my collapsed form and into the TARDIS itself, just as the doors slammed
shut behind me.<br>
(TARDIS door closing with burring sound.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I picked myself up and cried out with pain.
Suddenly, the shining control room seemed to sway and dip alarmingly,
as I staggered over to the console. Whatever poisons were in the dog's
sputum were now coursing through my bloodstream, and who knows what
diseases the hounds of that age carried? But where was the culprit
himself? He had burst into the room and pounded through the inner door,
mad with bloodlust, and confounded by the unexpected interior of the
ship. I was horrified to see the TARDIS's defences being breached like
this. What had I done? I had ushered the wolf hound into my home, and
with him, the deadly swarm itself. Adrenalin joined the poisons
flooding through me, and my off-kilter mind struggled with the
information of recent hours. Hadn't I set out with just this aim in
mind? I had pitched myself into the past in order to find the earliest
possible traces of my insect enemies. Having found them, I had lured
them aboard my ship. I had succeeded, surely, in purging the Middle
Ages of their awful menace?<br>
(TARDIS dematerialisation sound.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) With that thought in mind, I set to work on the
controls and plunged us swiftly into the vortex, leaving behind the
frozen wilderness of Northumbria. I took us outside of Space and Time,
into that curious region in which things are twined into one endlessly
spinning moment. I was determined not to return to any particular
location until I had managed some measure of control over my foes. The
captain of the feral pack was bounding along the gleaming corridors,
howling and gnashing his teeth, his huge eyes were burning with desire.
He had the savour of my blood in his mouth, and neither he nor the hive
mind of the insects that controlled him had ever tasted anything like
it before. As you may or may not know, Mike, the TARDIS is huge. Its
corridors loop round and about and twist perpetually into a vast cat's
cradle, a labyrinth, and yet I had to find them. Muzzy and in pain, I
set off in pursuit of the dog, orienting myself by his still-echoing
cries. I was armed as ever with nothing more than my sonic screwdriver,
and my wits, but I was sure I would think of something. I had to. I
ploughed down corridors and scarpered through a bewildering variety of
rooms and spaces, many of them crammed perplexingly with items of
furniture. Stately antiques from all periods of history, not just
Earth, but of other planets, including Gallifrey. There were treasures
from a thousand worlds, and portraits stern and smiling, fond ... and
unfamiliar. In my rabid-like stupor I began to wonder who all these
people were. Was I supposed to know them? Faces, and faces upon faces.
Was I supposed to remember all of these? Holograms flickered and danced
alongside the oil paintings, the multidimensional statues, the limpid
water-colour sketches.<br>
(Door opens - classical music playing.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) There were rooms filled with chamber music...<br>
(Door opens - laughing crowd.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Rooms filled with laughter....<br>
(Door opens - rushing water.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Rooms filled with the thunderous applause of waterfalls.<br>
(Door opens - ticking.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Rooms filled with clocks, ticking, ticking,
like the insect clicking of tiny mandibles. The air was quivering with
the shock-waves of infiltration. Dust came drifting down where it had
been disturbed, sifting like flour in every room. I was seized by a
sudden dread. What if in being bitten by the dog captain, I had also
been infected by the hornets? What if they were already now within me?<br>
<br>
(This is where the radio ended part one and started part two.)<br>
<br>THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I paused inside a great library, swaying with
nausea. Every book seemed to be identical, and try as I might I
couldn't read the title. My perception felt addled. Was I already
enslaved to their group mind? Or were these merely the fevered dreams
of a man infected and dying from a mediaeval dog bite? No. This was my
TARDIS. I knew where I was - I was safe here. This had been my refuge
for hundreds of years. We protected each other, the old girl and I.
Nothing could hurt me in here, nothing could get inside. But then I
thought uneasily of those malignant forces that <i> had</i>
managed to insinuate themselves in the past. The Mandragora Helix. The
insane Egyptian God, Sutekh. The TARDIS was not impregnable, not by a
long chalk. I had to go on. I had to find the hornet swarm. My head
seemed to be clearing at intervals, as my Time Lord defences fought
back against the canine diseases. Slowly, I was pulling through. I
dashed through an English country garden. I hurtled through a swamp I
never even knew I had. A laboratory, a garage, a sitting-room to rival
Napoleon The Third's in the Louvre Palace, until I became unsure of who
was chasing who. Was I the hunter or the hunted? We ran in great
exhausting circles until eventually by chance it seemed, we ran into
each other. I burst out of a tropical greenhouse into yet another
library. This one was crammed with leather-bound tomes. There was a
decidedly corrupt and smoky ambience, like the study of some ancient
necromancer who had just this minute fled the room and left a wolfhound
sitting in his velvet chair. The dog was panting from the chase. He
looked as panicked by the vertiginous dimensions of my ship as I
expected him to. He and his hornet masters must have believed they were
lost forever within the pocket universe of the TARDIS.<br>
<br>
(Growling.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: Good boy. Good boy...<br>
(Growling.)<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The hound growled low in his throat, until the
voice of the hornets' nest emerged from him, a distillation of the many
thousands of hornet voices inside of him.<br>
<br>
THE SWARM: Where have you brought us to? This is not the landscape in which we first encountered you.<br>
THE DOCTOR: No, we've left that planet now. Tell me, how did you arrive on Earth? Did someone take you there?<br>
THE SWARM: We fly of our own accord. We inhabit the darkness of Space.
We were blown to this world through the very depths of night.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I see. An accident. And having discovered that animal life
provides good mobile homes, you decided to make the best of it.<br>
THE SWARM: The quadrupeds were easy to control as we acclimatised to our new environment.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Whoever was in the pig drew the short straw, being stumbled on by the sisters like that.<br>
THE SWARM: Our Queen.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Ah, so that's why the others wanted her back so badly.<br>
THE SWARM: The female humans kept her prisoner.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Why didn't she just hop out of the pig into a nun, and walk out of there?<br>
THE SWARM: Those humans were ... contaminated.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Nuns? Contaminated? Their very name is a byword for purity.
Going about their own business making their ... Ah. It really was the
alcohol that put you off, wasn't it? All those whisky fumes. You
wouldn't like the Isle of Islay.<br>
THE SWARM: Enough! Who are you? Why have you brought us here?<br>
THE DOCTOR: I have taken you out of Time. You are aboard my ship now.
Though I'm not sure if that was a terribly wise thing to do.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The huge dog's eyes were wide. He was foaming
at the mouth by now, whimpering in terror at the language emanating
from his own body. Suddenly he leapt and jerked into action. I turned
to run, in no doubt this time about who was chasing who. More corridors,
more rooms I had never seen, galleries and walkways, staircases and
escalators, voices cried out to me, "Doctor, wait!" Where they came
from I had no idea. Then I was in some kind of galley kitchen, the air
inexplicably laced with the aroma of flaming crêpe suzette. I dimly
remembered a brochure about computer-controlled catering. Cordon bleu,
of course. The hungry dog was beguiled by the aroma of food, and stayed
there a while, hunting and snuffling for sustenance as I ploughed
onwards. If I could just find my way to the Power Room, the heart of
the TARDIS. I knew a quick route back from there to the control room.
But my senses were still corrupted, and I began to fear I was lost in
the TARDIS's inner catacombs. Sated by a pancake or four, the hound
caught up with me again in a well-appointed sitting-room, with French
windows open onto a terrace. His eyes were luminous with hatred and
greed.<br>
<br>
THE SWARM: Is your mind as labyrinthine as your vehicle, Doctor? We
would know you now. We would join with you, taste your thoughts.<br>
<br>
(Multiple insects buzzing.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) And then something happened that I had seen
only hours before, and I felt a very real sense of fear. The Swarm
began to leave the host body. The dog's eyes went blank, drained of all
evil intent as that glistening smoke issued out of him. The microscopic
insects crawled from his tear ducts and gathered noisily. They formed a
buzzing cloud between us in this strange study. They were coming for
me, hoping to take possession of me, at last. The hound collapsed from
exhaustion, his eyes closed as he lay, the churning morass of insect
forms turned almost lazily on the air, and surrounded me. In the next
few moments my whole world became infested. I could see nothing but
random dots and clots of darkness and the whirring of busily intent
tiny wings. They buzzed and hummed and formed a perfect cacophony of
insect music, and miniaturising themselves once again, they slipped
into my mind, as easily as you would slip gratefully into bed for a
well-earned sleep, Mike. The insects quivered and shook their miniscule
forms with pleasure as they began not just to read my mind, but to
unify with it, to seize control of it, to be at one with me. I cried
out, roared with horror and dismay. I had miscalculated. They were too
strong, I had left myself open and my ship also to their mercy. I had
made a vast mistake. I could feel them start to devour me from the
inside. Dismally, I thought of those others I had seen possessed by
these creatures. They never escaped, did they? Even when the hornets
left their bodies behind they were like empty shells, able to be
reoccupied at any moment. I could feel them crawling under my skin,
inside every&nbsp;fibre of my being, they were sampling and tippling
and tickling at the future, trying to drain me of all I knew, and of
everything that made me unique. Now when they spoke, their voice seemed
to emanate from deep within my mind.<br>
<br>
THE SWARM: You cannot fight us, Doctor. Let us discuss your taking us back to Earth.<br>
THE DOCTOR: No. There's nothing for you there. I can't - I won't take you.<br>
THE SWARM: Your mind tells another story. Your innermost thoughts
remind us that the future has already happened for you, Lord of Time.
We have heard of such beings. Whispers and&nbsp; rumours of a cosmic
race. It is said that your powers are ... godlike.<br>
THE DOCTOR: No. We are mere watchers. Some of us are dabblers. But in
the great scheme of things, we're nothing much to write home about.<br>
THE SWARM: You are disingenuous. This vessel itself could be put to so many interesting uses by such as the Swarm.<br>
THE DOCTOR: The TARDIS would never listen to you. She would destroy herself before letting herself become infested by you.<br>
THE SWARM: We do not need to infest the vehicle, Doctor, when we are already inside you.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I shuddered. An oblique feeling washed through
me, enervating every nerve and casting my spirits into awful gloom. I
knew the Swarm was right - my own body was moving against my will. Even
as I talked my physical form was marching out of that room and starting
to retrace its footsteps. The wolfhound climbed down from his chair,
and padded meekly after me. I didn't know it yet, but I was his new
master. The creature had been left a mindless blank by the insects'
exodus and he, poor dog, latched onto me, dogging my trailing scarf
ends.<br>
<br>
THE SWARM: We can make you do anything. We can make you take us
anywhere in any time, but for now Earth will suffice. We have begun to
adapt to it as our new home. Until now, we have had a very sheltered
life.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I don't wonder.<br>
THE SWARM: We work, we feed our young, we protect our Queen, we build
our glorious nests and we swarm in beautiful formation. Our wants are
very little, really.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh, but you'll want and want and want more and more - I've met your sort before.<br>
THE SWARM: You make light of this, but we can sense you are furious and
panicked. You feel desperate. You have no idea what to do about us.
You've never felt so alone in the face of an enemy. We are all around
you. We are inside you. We can alter your reality.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh, I - I've seen your party tricks, I ... I've been lost
inside a doll's house, in a circus ring, I've been chased by hideous
cadavers. I've seen you bend reality all right.<br>
THE SWARM: Fascinating. These things are in our future?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Not if I can help it. I'm stopping this thing right now,
I'm not returning you to Earth, I'm changing history and the future
before you can even get there.<br>
THE SWARM: But you are doomed, of course, Doctor. We are manifold, we
are the hornet Swarm, and only you stand between us and the Earth, and
you are very puny.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Hah! I - I've seen off greater threats than you lot. What
about the Pescatons, eh? Or the Trods? And the Vogons. The Krynoids
were no slackers, I can tell you.<br>
THE SWARM: Enough! You are blocking us with your nonsensical thoughts.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Er - I do tend to do that, yes.<br>
THE SWARM: We will control you, Doctor.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I doubt it.<br>
THE SWARM: Then look about you now. Look where you have led us. Did you mean to walk here with us?<br>
THE DOCTOR: What?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Without even&nbsp;realising it, I had at last found my way back to the control room.<br>
<br>
THE SWARM: Now who can't control you?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Rubbish! What are you lot anyway, just some kind of space
vermin, a swarm of fleas, hopping from one host to the next. You've got
nothing to offer the Universe, you can't even make honey.<br>
THE SWARM: Guard your tongue.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) With a single impulse, the hornets gave me a
taste of the most intense mental agony. I knew for certain that her
words were quite true - they <i> could </i>
do what they wanted with me. The stinging abated for a moment and I
slumped over the control console. I could feel the millions of tiny
legs and feelers tapping away inside me. I shuddered. My whole body
shook with affronted fury.<br>
<br>
THE SWARM: Now, pilot this strange magical ship of yours, Doctor. Take
us back into the world, back into Time. We have a destiny to meet.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) My hands moved across the controls with expertise and precision. I watched in appalled fascination...<br>
(TARDIS dematerialisation sound.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) ... as they made me enter coordinates, and set
the TARDIS in flight. My bitten hand sped expertly across the controls,
the wound healing all the time with Gallifreyan efficiency. Meanwhile,
the dog himself sat watching me, quite docile now. He seemed unharmed.
Perhaps then there <i> was </i>
some hope for the hosts that the hornets abandoned. Suddenly, asserting
my own self-will, I reached out to touch the controls again, and
experienced what felt like a huge electric shock. I screamed out in
pain as the insects colonising my mind stung me again and again, until
I was shaking and sobbing on the gleaming floor. They wouldn't let me
interfere. The time rotor rose and fell smoothly and easily as we
skipped across the vortex like a pebble flung across a lake. We were in
flight, and the hornets wouldn't let me tamper with or cancel our
course.<br>
<br>
THE SWARM: The Earth is waiting for us.<br>
THE DOCTOR: You mustn't interfere with human development. You must let them be.<br>
THE SWARM: To us <i>they</i> are the insects. We have judged the place right and proper for our new home.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I've dealt with so many like you lot, who see the rich
pickings of Earth and decide they must seize them for themselves.
Zygons, Axons, Nestenes, The Kraal. You know...<br>
(TARDIS materialisation.)<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) But I broke off as the rotor slowed to a halt.
We had landed on Earth once again. But where had I brought us to, and
in which period? Fight as I might, the hornets seemed at times
unstoppable. They seized hold of my damaged hand and drew it to the
door control.<br>
(TARDIS door opened.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) With a smooth hum, the TARDIS exterior doors slowly opened.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: No. You won't make me go out there, not against my own
will. I refuse to inflict the Swarm on another time and place.<br>
THE SWARM: You will do exactly as we command. You will be our vehicle
spreading our influence far and wide. Who are the rulers of this world,
whose minds should we pour ourselves into?<br>
THE DOCTOR: I will resist you with every fibre of my being.<br>
THE SWARM: It is quite futile.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Captain, the wolfhound, was tired of being cooped
up inside the ship. When he glimpsed the daylight beyond the doors and
sniffed the new air out there, he naturally went bounding towards it.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Captain, no! Stay here! Stay here, boy.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I had to get us both away from here. I had to
close the doors. I could feel the hornets within me itching to be out.
For so long since their arrival on Earth they had been in unforgiving
inhospitable climes. In the frozen Dark Ages, inside the mind of a pig,
places as dark and dull as the stretches of Space from whence they
came, but now there was this new place. They led me outside, I felt
them tumble and churn towards freedom, leaving me. Yes! In their
eagerness to swarm and flourish in the warm new air, they were leaving
my body. I moved in a cloud of insects, my battered defences buzzing,
the dog jumping at my heels, confused and snapping at our tiny foes. I
felt the last of them drain out of me, and blossom into the humid air.<br>
(Buzzing of multiple insects.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) My sense of triumph was short-lived, however. A
dark cloud of them whirled about me, a miniature cyclone noisy with
hate. Wherever I had brought them, they were free now to seek new
allies, new hosts. They whirled and spiralled away from me, and all my
work was undone. No longer were they contained and the Earth safe. What
had I done?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: No, come back!<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) We had arrived in brilliant bewildering
sunshine. The skies were azure and crystalline. I could smell the sea,
or rather, brackish water.<br>
(Lapping water.)<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Captain, come on. We have to find them. We can't just let them take over some other poor soul.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The Swarm was nearby, probing gingerly with its
hive mind, looking for humans, looking for beings with complex minds
and subtle desires and needs and dangerous thoughts. Somewhere beyond
these ruined half-submerged buildings lay a swampy lagoon, and beyond
that I could see the towers and domes of a magical city. It was
shimmering in the haze of the endless waters.<br>
(Chiming clock.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Somewhere, a clock chimed the hour. These
surroundings were ringing a nasty bell somewhere inside my addled
brain. Captain dashed across a square and was at the very lip of a
sluggish green canal. A vista of narrow houses and higgledy-piggledy
rooftops opened up around us. He turned to look back at me wagging his
tail. We were in Venice. Why did that realisation suddenly strike
terror into both my hearts, mm? A lagoon. We were near a lagoon. We
were at the very frangible edges of the ancient city. Why did that mean
something to me? Come on, Doctor, think. Think. Disturbed, I called
Captain once again more urgently, but he had the fermenting reek of the
lagoon waters in his nostrils, so tantalising, that imbroglio of
sweetly-decaying scents. I noticed then that we weren't alone. A small
human figure was sitting at the very edge of the water just beside us.
He had been watching us ever since our arrival. He was staring at the
TARDIS in wonderment. Oh no. A child, a lumpish distorted figure,
misshapen, crooked back, dwarfish? He looked perplexed and cross as
Captain barked the odds. All around the child, the hornets were
massing. As soon as they had emerged from the TARDIS they had found
their new prey, their new host. Captain and I were there to witness it.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Run! Get away from here, child!<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The tiny hunchback gasped out loud as the swarm
descended - he didn't have time to be frightened. The air filled
rapidly with their thick heavy noise. Captain yelped helplessly, then
merely growled and whimpered as the hornets poured into the small,
crooked body of the boy. Antonio stared at us both through the
moat-filled air, and tried to scream. Why weren't we helping him? Why
did we just stand there? He opened his mouth and the insects streamed
in. I would have recognised him anywhere. I had known him as an adult.
I had seen him in his own far future. Here there was none of that adult
corruption and greed about him. My hearts ached for him, and for what
the future had in store. I was helpless to stop them as the hornets
hurled themselves into the air and into their new home. This was when
and how they took over Antonio the circus master, and I had made it
possible. It was all because of me. Captain howled, and Antonio was
weirdly silent as the last of the hornets entered his broken form.
There was nothing I could do now. Once the air was clear the boy turned
on his heel, snapping into action with almost supernatural speed. He
was away for guttersnipe. He knew the decaying fringes of the city of
Venice better than anyone. When he pelted off away from us, Captain and
I gave chase, but to no avail.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: We've lost him, Captain. We've lost him.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The child and the Swarm were at large somewhere
in Venice in Seventeen Sixty-Eight. Antonio was possessed of unearthly
powers that he would soon learn to use to his own deadly advantage.
Captain and I walked for days in our search, the dog always bounding
ahead, sniffing the rich air, catching a million scents which
bamboozled him. If someone goes to ground in Venice and doesn't want to
be caught, he won't be. It is a city that welcomes the furtive, the
secretive, and repels those seeking him. During that time, I learned
what year it was, and calculated that as I suspected, I had brought my
enemies to just the right point in time to make the rest of their story
inevitable. The web of Time had healed itself. It had bent me to its
will to make sure everything ran with deadly efficiency. On the fourth
day I began to accept that we had lost our enemies. They had gone to
ground. All I could do was leave, and hope to fight them again, another
day, in another place.<br>
(TARDIS dematerialisation sound.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Back aboard the TARDIS at last, the console
flashed and glimmered as we took flight. History was on track, and I
felt hollow inside. I knew that somewhere in our temporal wake, Antonio
would grow from a child into a man, one who limped his cunning way
through the Eighteenth Century, steadily growing older, stronger, more
skilled and malevolent. He would create his own evil circus to run away
to, and leave Venice eventually. He would tour the continent, drawing
young ladies away from their homes, making them master the most
peculiar circus skills.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: I'd seen it all happen, hadn't I, Mike? I had witnessed the
fate of the marvellous Francesca, seen the hornets take over her body
and dash it straight to the ground, breaking her like a perfect doll. I
had failed to prevent her brother, mad with grief I imagine, from
stealing her body, embalming it, tending to it obsessively for the rest
of his life until somehow, one hundred years later, only her feet
remained, still shod in their exquisite satin slippers.<br>
MIKE YATES: The very slippers that got stolen from the Palace of Curios in the Thirties.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Quite right, Mike.<br>
MIKE YATES: There's something I've been meaning to ask. You've shown me
there's a direct line running from that porcine Mother Superior right
through to Cromer and Mrs Wibbsey, hundreds of years in which this
hornet swarm has festered and gathered in some pretty dark recesses,
but - what happened to it, once you repelled them from poor Ernestina?<br>
THE DOCTOR: You could say that was my greatest mistake. But the hornets
were still new to me, I hadn't yet fully understood their modus
operandum. Because her self-will appeared to have returned, I thought
I'd driven them out of the poor girl, but in fact I'd done no such
thing. They were still there, merely waiting, dormant and forgotten.
And even though Ernestina married and led an apparently normal life,
the hornet song continued thrumming quietly through the years, audible
only to those of a particularly sensitive nature. Her grandson Percival
was one such boy. He became obsessed with taxidermy, and built a
business on his interest, rescuing and restoring stuffed animals of all
kinds. It was Percy Noggins who drew me into this whole business in the
first place. Remember, Mike? Him and his demonic stuffed animals,
padding round in the night, buzzing fiercely with the bees, or rather
hornets, in their bonnets.<br>
MIKE YATES: And so this is where it ends up. Here, in Nest Cottage.
Your home from home in Sussex, which incidentally you still haven't
explained. I mean, I never imagined you were into real estate.<br>
THE DOCTOR: You wouldn't want to know everything about me, would you, Mike? I certainly wouldn't want to know everything...<br>
MIKE YATES: All right, all right. The point is, here we are, back where the story began.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Back for the final confrontation. I've seen history in the
making, Mike, I've watched in appalled helpless fascination as the
hornets have made their way through the decades towards this day. I
couldn't stop any of it, until now. I may have been instrumental in
spreading their influence but I've been successful in containing them
too. There's nothing to be done about the past, but what we must do now
is face the hornets here, and destroy them.<br>
MIKE YATES: Together?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes. If I'm not mistaken, dawn is arriving.<br>
MIKE YATES: It's certainly quieter upstairs.<br>
THE DOCTOR: The possessed sleep in the daytime because the hornets find
it easier to exert their control at night. They are creatures of
twilight, from the inky depths of Space.<br>
MIKE YATES: I suppose the question is, Doctor, what can I do to help?
You've been put through your paces by these monsters - I'm gratified
you should call on me for help - but mystified. It's the Twenty-First
Century. There are younger, better-equipped people around these days,
you know. Why on Earth did you call for me?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Don't take this the wrong way, Mike, but I don't entirely
know. You see, until Mrs Wibbsey relayed your telephone message to me,
I had no idea I had placed that magazine advert.<br>
MIKE YATES: But the references. It - it must have come from you.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Or someone close to me, someone who knows my situation, and a little of my past.<br>
MIKE YATES: Mrs ... Wibbsey?<br>
THE DOCTOR: I'm afraid it seems likely. She tried to insist that I had simply forgotten, but...<br>
MIKE YATES: That still doesn't explain why me. What possible role could <i>I</i> have to play in all this?<br>
THE DOCTOR: What indeed? I should think the answer to that lies ahead
of us. Here. Drink your tea. Soon Mrs Wibbsey will be up and about.<br>
(Banging on door.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Are you down there? What's been going on?<br>
MIKE YATES: Right on cue.<br>
THE DOCTOR: In the daytime she's fairly harmless.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Doctor? Are you and your friend wanting breakfast?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes please, Mrs Wibbsey. Full English, if you don't mind. And porridge for Mr Yates. We've a long day ahead of us.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Not as long as mine.<br>
MIKE YATES: I don't like the sound of her. Are you certain she's under your hypnotic control?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Not certain, no. We'd better go up.<br>
MIKE YATES: I'll go first, just in case.<br>
THE DOCTOR: There's no need for that. They'll all be asleep again.<br>
MIKE YATES: All the same, I'm expendable, you're not.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: I can't bring breakfast down there to you.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Right you are. We're coming out.<br>
MIKE YATES: There could be anything on the other side of that door waiting for us.<br>
(Banging on door.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Doctor?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Everything in this house of mine has been under the
hornets' spell at one time or another. Mrs Wibbsey, the animals, even
me, Mike.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: There's really nothing to be scared of.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Ready, Captain Yates?<br>
MIKE YATES: As I'll ever be.<br>
(Door opened. Barking, snarling and growling of many beasts.)<br>
