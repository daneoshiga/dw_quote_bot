<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis lands on an island dominated by a huge
pyramid. Ian is still wearing a silk Chinese jacket instead of his
cardigan) <br>
IAN: Any radiation, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No, nothing to speak of. The counter's hardly reading anything.
Shall we take a look? <br>
BARBARA: Pity you don't have colour television. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but I have. <br>
BARBARA: Where is it, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, at the moment it's temporarily hors de combat. <br>
(They look at the scanner) <br>
BARBARA: Oh, look. That's the sea, isn't it? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, and sand. Grandfather, I wonder where we are? <br>
IAN: One thing's sure. We're not at Southend. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, can we go and have a look? Can we? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I don't think, I don't see why not. There's nothing, no
danger about. Come on. Let's go and have a look. <br>
IAN: No. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
IAN: Well, I thought when you switched the scanner on, I thought I saw
something move up there. Oh, probably just a shadow. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's go outside and have a look. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Island]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Four torpedo-like things glide up to the beach.
On closer inspection, they look like metal fish) <br>
SUSAN: It is the sea. It's beautiful. <br>
IAN: Yes, absolutely calm. Not even a ripple. <br>
BARBARA: It isn't frozen, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: No, impossible in this temperature. Besides, it's too warm. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, do you think it's safe to go for a swim? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no. Not at the moment, child. However inviting that
water looks, we don't know what sort of creatures might be lurking
beneath its surface. <br>
(They explore the rocks, and don't see the frogman with flippers
following them) <br>
BARBARA: It's so quiet. <br>
IAN: Yes, it is. No birds or anything. <br>
BARBARA: There's nothing growing. <br>
DOCTOR: I say, what do you make of this, Chesterton? Fascinating. <br>
IAN: It's glass. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it is, isn't it. Yes. Glass instead of sand, eh?
Intriguing, intriguing, my boy. <br>
IAN: Do you think the sand turned into glass? <br>
DOCTOR: Or was the glass put here deliberately, and if so, why, hmm? <br>
SUSAN: There's a lovely pool over here. If I can't swim, at least I can
paddle. <br>
BARBARA: (slipping and bumping into her, making her drop a shoe into
the pool) Oh, sorry, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Never mind. I'll get it. You going to come in? <br>
BARBARA: No. <br>
IAN: No, Susan, don't! <br>
(He's spotted the shoe dissolving in the water) <br>
BARBARA: Ian, what is it? <br>
IAN: Must be some sort of acid. <br>
BARBARA: But it was so fast. It just seemed to dissolve. <br>
SUSAN: And I was going to paddle in it. <br>
BARBARA: It's all right, Susan. It's all right. Look, you've got some
more shoes back at the ship, haven't you? Well, go and put them on.
We'll wait here for you. <br>
IAN: Here, you'd better take my boots. <br>
SUSAN: I can't put those on. They're much too big for me. <br>
BARBARA: Now, come on. It's better than cutting your feet open on this
glass. <br>
SUSAN: All right. <br>
IAN: There. <br>
SUSAN: I'm going to fill them up with sand anyway. <br>
IAN: All right? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>
IAN: They'll give you lovely corns, those will. <br>
BARBARA: Seven league boots, hey? <br>
(Susan clumps off) <br>
BARBARA: Ian. This is a tidal pool. <br>
IAN: Yes, I agree. Rather ties up with the glass beach, doesn't it. <br>
BARBARA: Then everything out there is acid too. A sea of acid. <br>
(The frogman tries to get into the Tardis, then hides as Susan returns)
<br>
DOCTOR: Sea of acid. Astonishing. You know, in all my travels I've
never come across anything like this before. However, Susan wasn't
harmed, anyway. <br>
BARBARA: She was a bit frightened of losing her shoes, but she's gone
back to the ship for another pair. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and if you'd had your shoes on, my boy, you could have
lent her hers. You mustn't get sloppy in your habits, you know. Good
gracious. <br>
(He's seen the metal fish on the beach) <br>
BARBARA: It looks like a glass torpedo. <br>
IAN: Or a one man submarine. It's certainly designed for going under
the water. <br>
DOCTOR: Under acid, more likely. <br>
IAN: Yes. I don't know if it's occurred to you, Doctor, but this means
this place is inhabited. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, it has occurred to me. Let's see what it is. Help me
get this top off. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
BARBARA: There's another one over here, and there's something inside
it. <br>
(Susan comes out of the Tardis in a fresh pair of pumps, and carrying
Ian's boots, when she notices the imprint of a frogman's flipper in the
sand.) <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather! <br>
(She goes to follow the trail) <br>
DOCTOR: See that crack along there? It's where the acid must have
seeped in. <br>
IAN: That's got it. <br>
(The sub opens) <br>
IAN: Now, let's have a look at you. <br>
DOCTOR: Use that, use that. <br>
IAN: Hmm? Oh, all right. (uses the Doctor's walking stick to pull out a
frogman's suit) <br>
BARBARA: It's a protective suit! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and whatever it was wore it, is similar to a human being,
hmm? <br>
IAN: Yes, but how did it get out? Seems to be perfectly intact. <br>
BARBARA: I don't think it did get out. There's a tear in the material
here. <br>
IAN: You mean the acid got in. Poor devil. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I think we ought to go back to the ship and try and
find Susan. She should have caught up with us by now. Come along. <br>
IAN: Look at that fantastic building! (the pyramid) <br>
DOCTOR: Good! Now perhaps we might learn who it is that uses these
strange ships. Anyway, lets get back to the ship and find Susan. Later,
perhaps, a little visiting, I think. <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
(Susan has already made it to the pyramid, and the frogman is waiting
around the corner with a raised knife. Meanwhile, at the Tardis) <br>
BARBARA: She isn't inside anywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, wretched child. Now where's she got to, I wonder? <br>
BARBARA: Ian, there are your boots. And there are Susan's footprints in
the sand here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, sand here and glass on the beach. I'm beginning to think
that sea of acid is a defence barrier. <br>
IAN: Except against glass submarines, eh, Doctor? <br>
BARBARA: What you mean is that all visitors are unwelcome. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it would seem so. <br>
IAN: We must find Susan. She may have gone to have a look at that
building. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the building]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The slab of wall behind the would-be assassin
suddenly opens and he falls inside the building just before Susan
rounds the corner)<br>
IAN: Oh, it's enormous!<br>
BARBARA: Look at the joins in the blocks, Ian. <br>
IAN: Yes, no mortar. Must have been built with tremendous accuracy. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, the Egyptians did the same thing. So did the Indians of
Central and Southern America. <br>
IAN: A precise distribution of weight, that's the key, isn't it? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. Marvellous, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, now before you two get carried away, I think we'd better
go and find Susan, hmm?<br>
BARBARA: Yes, you're quite right. <br>
IAN: Well, for a start, let's make a circuit of this place. <br>
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now I suggest we go different ways and meet back at
the furthermost point, which is probably round the corner there
somewhere. Off you go, off you go now. <br>
(Susan leans against the wall, it opens under her weight and she
screams as she falls in) <br>
BARBARA: Did you hear that? <br>
IAN: Yes, it was Susan. Come on! <br>
(The Doctor also gets pulled inside just before Barbara and Ian arrive)
<br>
BARBARA: I could have sworn I heard her. <br>
IAN: We certainly heard something. Can't be sure it was Susan, of
course. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I am sure. <br>
IAN: Yes, but where's the Doctor? Even if he'd been travelling at half
speed, he should have reached that far corner by now. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Inside the building, Susan is walking slowly down
a corridor towards where the frogman is hiding, when a person in a robe
passes behind her. She turns, they ignore her, and she continues
backwards until the frogman grabs her. She screams, he lets go and
falls to the floor with his own knife in his back. The robed figure
returns) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the building]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BARBARA: Well, Ian, there's only one thing to do.
That's another circuit of the walls. <br>
IAN [OC]: I've just been all around and I couldn't find a door
anywhere. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I suppose there's every chance she didn't come this way.
She's probably back at the ship waiting for us. I said, she's probably
back at the ship waiting for us. Ian? Ian? Ian! <br>
(Finally, she leans against the wall too and gets taken inside where we
can see a robed figure) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ian has found the dead frogman. Elsewhere,
Barbara and the Doctor have found Susan) <br>
SUSAN: Dreadful. The wall just seemed to swallow me up, and then this
man grabbed me and the next thing I knew, he fell dead in front of me. <br>
BARBARA: Man? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. From what Susan has described, he was wearing a suit
similar to the one we found on the beach. <br>
BARBARA: Are these the ones that live here? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. The man wearing the monk's habit lives in this
building. <br>
BARBARA: So the men from the glass submarines are intruders, like us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, with one difference, which is puzzling but revealing. They
died, and we're only prisoners. <br>
BARBARA: Well maybe we're to be killed, too. <br>
DOCTOR: I shouldn't worry too much about that. That young schoolmaster
friend of yours is very resourceful. Whilst he's free, our chance of
rescue is still good. <br>
BARBARA: Well, that's just it, Doctor. He isn't free. He was captured
before I was. <br>
(Ian comes to the rescue of a 'monk' being attacked by another frogman.
The frogman falls through another movable wall panel and down a long
way into water, or rather, acid) <br>
ARBITAN: Why do you protect me? <br>
IAN: Are you a prisoner here? <br>
ARBITAN: In a way. I can never leave here. In a way, this is my home. <br>
IAN: Where are my friends? <br>
ARBITAN: Safe. I saw your machine materialise. Until I knew otherwise I
had to treat you as potential enemies. The Voord were trying to
penetrate the walls. <br>
IAN: The Voord? <br>
ARBITAN: The man you just saved me from was a Voord. It's many years
since their last assault, but now they've returned and if they continue
to come they're bound to succeed eventually. <br>
IAN: I should have thought this place was impregnable. How many of you
defend it? <br>
ARBITAN: How many? I am alone. Oh, please, let us release your
companions and then I'll try to explain. <br>
IAN: Good idea. <br>
(Their departure is watched by another frogman) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I want to know more about this
planet. Your technology, you say, reached its peak over two thousand
years ago? <br>
ARBITAN: Yes, and all our knowledge culminated in the manufacture of
this. At the time, it was called the Conscience of Marinus. Marinus,
that is the name of our planet. At first, this machine was simply a
judge and jury that was never wrong, and unfair. And then we added to
it, improved on it, made it more and more sophisticated so that finally
it became possible to radiate its power and influence the minds of men
throughout the planet. They no longer had to decide what was wrong or
right. The machine decided for them. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And in that case it was possible to eliminate evil from
the minds of men for all time. <br>
ARBITAN: That is exactly what happened. Marinus was unique in the
universe. Robbery, fear, hate, violence were unknown among us. Yes,
yes, for seven centuries we prospered, and then a man named Yartek
found a means of overcoming the power of the machine. He and his
followers, the Voords, were able to rob, exploit, kill, cheat. Our
people could not resist because violence is alien to them. <br>
(A Voord is eavesdropping on all this) <br>
IAN: But surely by this time this machine had become a great danger to
you? If it had fallen into the hands of the Voords, they could have
controlled Marinus. Why didn't you destroy it? <br>
ARBITAN: We always hoped to find a way of modifying it and making it
again irresistible. So instead of destroying it, we removed the five
key microcircuits. <br>
IAN: What did you do with them? <br>
ARBITAN: One of them, I kept. There it is. (points up) The other four
were taken and put in places of safety all over Marinus. Only I know
where they are, and now the time has come when they must be recovered. <br>
BARBARA: Well why don't you simply make new keys? <br>
ARBITAN: The keys are very simple, but the microcircuits inside are
very complicated. A permutation of numbers and signals that would take
a thousand years to unravel. And besides, since the keys were hidden, I
have worked on this machine and modified it, so that when they're
replaced <br>
DOCTOR: When they're replaced it would mean that your machine is
irresistible and you can overcome and control the Voords again. <br>
ARBITAN: Yes. <br>
IAN: Surely there must be someone you can send for these keys? <br>
ARBITAN: Through the years all my friends, all my followers, have gone.
They have never returned. Last year I sent my daughter. She has not
come back. All I have now to comfort me is the distant echo of her
voice, the imagined sound of her footsteps. But now your coming's
brought new hope. Oh yes, yes, you must find the keys for me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BARBARA: Ian, wait a minute. The Doctor's miles
behind. I don't know about you, but I felt terrible leaving that old
man. We seem to be his last hope. <br>
IAN: Yes, I wish there had been something we could have done for him. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, come on, Grandfather. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm coming, child. Don't rush, I'm coming. Well, don't just
stand there, come along, come along. Keeping me waiting. <br>
(He tries to put the key in the Tardis lock, but something is forming a
barrier a couple of inches away from it) <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
BARBARA: What is it? <br>
IAN: Well, it's some sort of invisible barrier. What do you make of it,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I don't know. There's no substance here. Have a
look round the side, child. Go along. <br>
BARBARA: It's like an invisible wall. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it a circular barrier? <br>
SUSAN: Goes all the way round. Can't see a cause to it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, of course, there wouldn't be. The molecules would be at
their weakest. Ha! It's fascinating, Chesterton. Yes, I've got it, I've
got it. You know, I think a force barrier has been put up around the
ship. <br>
ARBITAN [OC]: I am sorry you forced me to keep you from your ship, but
your refusal to help me left me no alternative. <br>
IAN: Arbitan, where are you? <br>
ARBITAN [OC]: That is not important. If you help me find the keys of
Marinus, I will let you have access to your machine when you have
delivered all the keys to me. If not, you will stay on the island
without food or water. The choice is yours. <br>
IAN: Choice? What choice? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They are looking at a map) <br>
IAN: Well, at least we know the rough location of the keys. Now all we
have to do is get them. <br>
ARBITAN: As soon as you have started your voyage, I will release the
forcefield. Your ship will be available to you when you return. <br>
BARBARA: If we return. <br>
DOCTOR: I know we have no choice, but this whole affair is outrageous.
Blackmail, pure and simply blackmail. <br>
IAN: Oh, Doctor, don't lets go through all that again. Let's just get
on with the job. <br>
ARBITAN: Perhaps you will bring me news of my daughter. I miss her.
Yes, I miss her. <br>
DOCTOR: And another thing. If you think I'm going to travel across that
acid sea in one of these primitive submersibles, you're very much
mistaken. <br>
ARBITAN: I wouldn't think of asking you to travel in such an absurd
way. No, I'm going to give you a device which will enable you to move
from place to place. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, really. <br>
ARBITAN: The principle is much the same as that of your ship. Place
that around your wrist, please. You told me about, except this will
enable you to cross space, not time. <br>
IAN: What, this little thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh don't be ridiculous, my boy. This is a perfectly acceptable
method of travel. Very compact and very neat, sir, if I may say. Yes. <br>
ARBITAN: They're all programmed to the same destination. You have only
to twist the dial once. <br>
BARBARA: Like this? <br>
(Barbara vanishes) <br>
SUSAN: Barbara! <br>
IAN: What! What have you done to Barbara? <br>
ARBITAN: You must not waste time. You must follow, quickly. One final
word. If when you return, you find the Voord have taken this building,
do not let them get the keys. You understand? Destroy them! Now, now,
twist the dials. <br>
(Ian, Susan and the Doctor vanish) <br>
ARBITAN: For the sake of all my people, I hope you succeed. <br>
(A Voord sneaks up behind Arbitan and stabs him in the back) </font></p>

her own free will. <br>
SUSAN: No, surely she'd wait for us. <br>
IAN: Of course she would. <br>
DOCTOR: It seems there's only one conclusion. What ever it is that's
behind that door must have taken her by force. <br>
IAN: Let's get inside. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. Don't let us be precipitous. <br>
IAN: Doctor, there's blood on this strap. That means she's hurt, maybe
badly. We can't argue now. Let's get inside. <br>

bright flashing light, an alarm and a lot of statues. Then the flashing
stops and they get a good look at the comfortable furniture, urns of
plants, and) <br>
IAN: I don't believe it. <br>
BARBARA: Ian! Susan! I'm glad you're here. <br>
(Barbara is dressed Roman style, reclining on a couch and being waited
on by two women) <br>
SUSAN: Barbara! You're all right! <br>
BARBARA: Of course I'm all right. In fact I'm better than all right. <br>
SUSAN: We saw your travel dial. There was blood on it. <br>
BARBARA: I know. That was silly. I turned the dial and I seemed to be
falling through space. I got frightened and tried to tear it off my
wrist. It just scratched me, see. <br>
IAN: Well, I must say, quite a nice little place you've got here. <br>
BARBARA: You haven't seen anything yet. Will you get some food for my
friends? <br>
(The two women bow and leave) <br>
BARBARA: You may be seated. <br>
IAN: Your royal highness is most gracious. Perhaps if your majesty will
stop hogging the grapes we can all have some. <br>
BARBARA: Help yourself. <br>
IAN: Thanks. <br>
SUSAN: This is great. <br>
IAN: Well, what do you think about all this, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, sensuous and decadent, but rather pleasant. I say, is that
a pomegranate? <br>
IAN: Yes, here you are. <br>
DOCTOR: Extraordinary. <br>
IAN: Well, whatever we expected, it certainly wasn't anything like
this. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, those silks. They're gorgeous. I'd love a dress made from
one of these. <br>
BARBARA: Well, that's what they're here for. They asked me to choose
the materials I wanted for my robe. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all most remarkable. <br>
(A gong sounds and four young women enter with trays of food) <br>
BARBARA: Oh, it's magnificent. <br>
IAN: It certainly is. <br>
SUSAN: Hey, I'm starving. <br>
BARBARA: What's the matter? Don't you like it? <br>
IAN: No, I've just realised nobody's shown me the menu. <br>
SUSAN: They've got everything here. <br>
DOCTOR: Truffles. I do believe they're truffles. Well, well. <br>
BARBARA: Go on, Ian. Have one. <br>
IAN: No. You see, I don't know the price yet. <br>
BARBARA: But we're guests here. <br>
IAN: You've met the host, have you? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, I have, and his manners are perfect. <br>
DOCTOR: So is his kitchen. Delicious. <br>
SUSAN: Hey, we've got a visitor. <br>
IAN: This is where we pay the bill. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, relax, Ian. <br>
ALTOS: No, no, don't get up. I apologise for intruding, but I wondered
if there was anything you wanted? <br>
BARBARA: There is one thing you could do. Tell us about this place,
about your people. Who do we have to thank for all this? <br>
ALTOS: You are in the city of Morphoton. Our people are perhaps the
most contented in the universe. Nothing they desire is denied them. <br>
SUSAN: Could I have a dress made <br>
DOCTOR: Susan. <br>
ALTOS: No, please, please, let her go on. <br>
SUSAN: Well, I'd love a dress made from this silk here. <br>
DOCTOR: Susan, I will not have you take advantage <br>
ALTOS: She takes no advantage. Truly. Our one wish is to fulfil your
every need. She shall have the dress. <br>
SUSAN: Thank you. Thank you. <br>
ALTOS: And you? Have you no wish, no great desire? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, er, yes, perhaps, but I'm afraid it's not quite as easy
as giving Susan a dress out of that. <br>
SUSAN: What is it, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps, if I had to choose, a well equipped laboratory
with every conceivable instrument. Yes. Yes. <br>
ALTOS: It will be arranged. <br>
IAN: It will? You mean he can have it? <br>
ALTOS: Perhaps in the morning when you see the laboratory, you will
find our way of life easier to understand, to believe. Now, as it is
late, I suggest you sleep. In the morning, when you wake, you will
learn everything about Morphoton. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, we shall look forward to that. <br>
IAN: Yes, and even if you're not serious about the laboratory, we're
very grateful <br>
ALTOS: But I am serious. Goodnight. <br>
BARBARA: Goodnight. <br>
DOCTOR: Charming young man. Yes, charming. I think a study of this
culture is going to prove very, very fascinating. Oh, dear me. I'm
tired, you know. <br>
BARBARA: I think the excitement's been too much for Susan, too. Come
on. <br>
(Barbara lies the already-sleeping Susan on a couch) <br>
BARBARA: Well, you don't look very happy. <br>
IAN: Me? No, no, no, not at all. Well, I think it's all marvellous. <br>
BARBARA: You're not very convincing. I don't know what you want. <br>
IAN: Perhaps it's my materialistic side. How rich and powerful do you
have to be to give things away free? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, now don't spoil it all for me. <br>
IAN: I didn't mean to do that. <br>
BARBARA: You can't apply Earth standards. You just can't. <br>
IAN: No. Certainly very different here. You notice that man's eyes? <br>
BARBARA: What about them? <br>
IAN: He didn't blink once. Am I being ridiculous? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. They're just kind, hospitable people. <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
BARBARA: Try to get some sleep. You'll feel differently in the morning.
<br>
IAN: I suppose it could be worse. <br>
(Once they have all laid down and closed their eyes, the eyes on a
carving in the wall light up. A woman enters through a secret door and
places a device on each of their foreheads, then leaves. But Barbara's
head rolls to the side, the device falls off and she sits up. Lights
flash and there is a discordant sound. Barbara clutches her head in
pain, then passes out) <br>
(Next morning, Susan, Ian and the Doctor are having breakfast) <br>
IAN: Oh, good morning. Thank you very much. <br>
(But the serving girl does not reply) <br>
DOCTOR: Most refreshing. <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at these exquisite glasses, Chesterton. <br>
SUSAN: Can I have some more orange juice, please? <br>
IAN: Why not? Help yourself, there's plenty more. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, child. Don't take it all. We must leave some for
Barbara when she wakes up. <br>
IAN: Yes, Barbara. She really is having a deep sleep, isn't she? <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter, hmm? <br>
IAN: Oh, this, oh, I don't know. Just a sort of mild irritation on the
forehead. It's nothing at all. <br>
DOCTOR: No, there's nothing there. I only mentioned it because I have
rather a sore spot here myself. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, look! Look, Grandfather, it's my dress. Thank you. Thank
you. It's beautiful, look. <br>
IAN: Yes, it really is very elegant, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Can I show Barbara? Can I wake her up? <br>
IAN: Why not. She can't sleep all the morning. <br>
SUSAN: Barbara. Barbara. Wake up. Wake up. <br>
BARBARA: What's happened? <br>
IAN: What's the matter? <br>
BARBARA: Well, look. Look around you. Can't you see? <br>
(From Barbara's viewpoint, the room is dusty and dirty, not elegant and
luxurious any more) <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think she's properly awake. Susan, get me a glass of
that fruit juice, will you? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>
(But instead of a glass goblet, he offers her a china mug) <br>
DOCTOR: Here, drink this. <br>
BARBARA: No, it's filthy! <br>
DOCTOR: Now you've broken it. <br>
IAN: Barbara, what's got into you? <br>
BARBARA: Why can't you see? <br>
DOCTOR: This is going to test our host's patience, you know. It's one
of a set. <br>
BARBARA: It's just a dirty old mug. And the room, why have they changed
it? <br>
SUSAN: It's the same, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: No it isn't. It isn't. And this terrible dress. And the
furniture. <br>
DOCTOR: What's happened to her? <br>
BARBARA: Why can't you see it? <br>
IAN: Barbara, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: It's all changed! <br>
IAN: Come on, now, get a hold of yourself. <br>
SUSAN: Don't be frightened, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: Ian, try to see. Please. Try to see the truth. <br>
SUSAN: Don't be afraid. Look. They brought me my dress. <br>
(Barbara sees a tatty sack-cloth thing) <br>
BARBARA: It's dirty. Dirty rags. <br>
IAN: Barbara, these people are very kind to us. They've given us
everything. <br>
BARBARA: They've given you nothing. I don't know what they've done to
you, or why it hasn't worked on me, but I must find a way to show you.
I must, before it's too late. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, here comes Altos. Now perhaps he can convince you. <br>
BARBARA: He knows it's failed on me. <br>
ALTOS: What's the matter? Aren't you feeling well? Let me take you to
our physicians. <br>
BARBARA: No. No. <br>
ALTOS: Please, I only want to help you. <br>
BARBARA: No! <br>
(Barbara runs out of the room) <br>
IAN: Barbara! <br>
ALTOS: Please, don't concern yourself. She's overwrought. I'll deal
with it. You stay here. <br>

the door again, she can't get back out) </font></p>

to weaken, memories fading. When they wake, all resistance will have

MORPHO: The two men will join the working parties. We can use the
younger one's strength with the haulage gangs. The old man is weaker,
but intelligent. Isolate him and put him to work on the scheme for
increasing my powers. As for the child, she must be trained rapidly.
She will take the place of Sabetha, the one that failed us. <br>

need the help of the human body to feed us and to carry out our orders.
<br>
BARBARA: You use your people to act as machines for you. <br>
MORPHO: Much more than machines. The human body is the most flexible
instrument in the world. No single mechanical device could reproduce
its mobility and dexterity. <br>

Arbitan's couriers. <br>
IAN: They're coming with us? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. He's going with you, certainly. By the way, I found these
travel dials. Those repellant brain things didn't appreciate their
significance, fortunately. <br>

DOCTOR: I will explain it all in good time. Ah, here are the others. <br>
IAN: Good. Let's go, then. <br>
DOCTOR: No, wait. Now, we have one key and there are three more to
find. <br>
SUSAN: Yes. Sabetha wanted to continue the search with us. <br>
ALTOS: I wish to join you, too. <br>
DOCTOR: Good idea. <br>
ALTOS: I was sent by Arbitan. I and a friend called Eprin. Our plan was
as follows. He would go ahead in search of key four, and I would come
here for the first. <br>
IAN: Arbitan hadn't heard from either of you. Or anyone else, for that
matter. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we must presume something has happened to your friend
Eprin. <br>
ALTOS: It may just be that he couldn't reach the key. It lies somewhere
in the city of Millenius. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, the place you mentioned, yes. The highly civilised
society. Now then, I've decided to adopt his plan. <br>
IAN: What? You mean go two jumps ahead and try and find the fourth key?
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. I shall try and find out what's happened to
your friend Eprin. If he's alive, make contact, then we can all meet
again. <br>
SUSAN: Do you know how to adjust the dial, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Altos has shown me how to adjust mine. <br>
SUSAN: Yours? Well, aren't I coming? <br>
DOCTOR: No. I think it better if you travel with the main party, child.
<br>
SUSAN: But I want to go with you! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know, Susan, but don't you see it's better if we
split our forces. You see, it's a very dangerous situation and the
sooner we get on with it, the better. For my part, I know you'll be
well looked after. And as for me, well, I'm going to a well-ordered
society and I think it's the best and speediest way, really. <br>
SUSAN: All right. Won't be for long though, will it? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
BARBARA: I was wondering if we should fix a time to meet. <br>
DOCTOR: Say five days. <br>
IAN: Yes, that's not a bad idea. But you'd better give us another two
just in case of possible delays. <br>
BARBARA: I hope everything won't be as bad as this place. <br>

SUSAN: Well that's just it. I can't remember. I just recognise it as
being something evil. <br>
BARBARA: You know, I've never seen vegetation as dense as this before.
It'll overrun the building in time. <br>
SUSAN: Do you think the key's inside, Barbara? <br>
BARBARA: Oh yes, it must be. It's a funny old place, isn't it? You
know, in a few years these walls will be so weak you could push your
way through. <br>
(Meanwhile, a climbing plant is moving on its own toward where Susan is
lying on the ground, relaxing) <br>
BARBARA: You know, Susan, looking at this archway, I'm not at all sure.
It isn't half as dense as it looks. I'm sure we could get through. <br>

end of the tunnel. An idol or something. <br>

perhaps things aren't as bad as they seem. <br>
IAN: What do you mean? <br>
SABETHA: Well, Barbara was wearing her travel dial, wasn't she? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. None of us have taken them off. <br>
SABETHA: Then as long as she wasn't injured when she was trapped, she
can escape whenever she wants. <br>
IAN: It's a possibility. <br>
ALTOS: Well, I'm sure she would have thought of that. <br>
IAN: Yes, of course. She may not have taken advantage of it yet.
Anything might have happened to her. <br>
SABETHA: But if she was in danger, she'd have to use her travel dial. <br>
(They hear the mechanism) <br>
SUSAN: It's turning again. Now the arms are open. <br>
ALTOS: That means it either must have released her or she's escaped. <br>
IAN: She may have been injured, or even <br>
SABETHA: But if she used her travel dial, and gone on to the next
destination, we don't know what danger she may be in there. <br>
IAN: No. Well, we must cover all possibilities to the best of our
abilities. You'd better go on ahead with Susan and Altos. <br>
ALTOS: Yes, that's wise. I think that is the wisest course. <br>
SUSAN: Ian, what are you going to do? <br>
IAN: I'm going back in there. If that idol works once as a trap,
there's no reason why it shouldn't work again. Once inside, well, if
there's no sign of Barbara, I'll follow you as quickly as I can. <br>

ready, Sabetha? Susan? <br>

ALTOS: Take care, my friend. <br>
SUSAN: Goodbye, Ian. <br>
IAN: Good luck. (Altos and Susan vanish. Sabetha has dropped the
micro-key) Here, you'd better put this on your chain with the other
one. We don't want you losing it somewhere in outer space. <br>
SABETHA: That would be terrible. There. I think that's safe enough.
This isn't it. <br>
IAN: What? <br>
SABETHA: It's just an imitation. Look, Ian. This edge is a fraction
shorter. <br>
IAN: Are you absolutely sure? I mean, isn't it possible there was some
genuine variation in the original micro-keys? <br>
SABETHA: No, they all look absolutely identical, so this one must be an
imitation. <br>
IAN: We're no further on than when we arrived here. <br>

IAN: No. You go on ahead with the others. They'll be worried already.

you hadn't turned up in another half an hour I was going to turn the

IAN: I'm glad you didn't. That micro-key you found, it was a fake. <br>
BARBARA: What? <br>
IAN: Yes. The real one must be in here somewhere. <br>
BARBARA: And I warn you it's not going to be easy to find. <br>
IAN: No? <br>
BARBARA: This whole place is one big booby-trap. It's full of things
like that statue. I'd only been here a minute when part of the wall
crashed down just where I'd been standing. <br>
IAN: We'll take it very slowly. That doorway looks a good place to
start. Any idea where it leads to? <br>
BARBARA: No. Into the building, I suppose. <br>
IAN: Well, that's a likely place to hide a key. Come on. <br>
BARBARA: These vines are everywhere. They seem to be crawling all over
the building. <br>
IAN: Not only the vines. It's all vegetation. Look at that wall. <br>
BARBARA: It seems to be trying to get in. <br>
IAN: Let's get the micro-key and get out of here. It looks as if we're
going to have to break this door down. It's pretty solid. I shall need
something to. I wish I could. <br>

the ceiling has knives sticking out of it, and it is descending towards

trapped behind an iron grating) <br>

put my traps in motion. Only those warned by Arbitan could avoid them. <br>

IAN: And a combination one, at that. <br>
BARBARA: D E 3 O 2. <br>
IAN: Hello. It's only got the letters on. Perhaps the figures were the
numbers of turns? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, try it. <br>
IAN: D E 1 2 3 O 1 2. It doesn't work. Are you sure we got it right? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, certain. <br>
IAN: Try again. D E 1 2 3 O 1 2. No, no, it doesn't work. Well, I
suppose he could have hidden the combination somewhere. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, I suppose so. There's also a possibility that he didn't
mean the safe at all. Judging by the traps and decoys around here, I
should think the obvious hiding place is the least likely. <br>
IAN: We must go over this room inch by inch. Eliminating everything but
the safe. Then if we haven't found it, it must be in here. <br>
BARBARA: I'll start over here. <br>
(Much later) <br>
BARBARA: Ian, I've been trying to think back. What did he mean,
darkness, the whispering will begin. Whispering? I wonder if that's
what Susan heard? <br>
IAN: I don't know. I think he was rambling, he didn't mean anything.
I'm hoping to find a lead in here. It's a diary of his experiments. <br>
BARBARA: What was he working on? <br>
IAN: Biology seems to have been his field as far as I can make out. <br>
BARBARA: Well, judging by the specimens in here, I'd say he was very
successful. <br>
IAN: Yes. Last couple of entries are a bit strange. All about the
balance of nature and increased destructive forces. Listen to this.
Nature has a fixed tempo of destruction. Water dripping on a stone may
take a thousand years to produce any sign of wear. <br>
BARBARA: Well, that's not very original. <br>
IAN: It is if you could speed up everything. The wear on the stone
could happen in one day. <br>
BARBARA: But that's ridiculous. <br>
IAN: Is it? He didn't seem to think so. He ends up by saying, the
growth accelerator has changed nature's tempo of destruction entirely. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, well that may all be very fascinating, but we are
supposed to be looking for the combination to that safe. <br>
IAN: All right. All right. <br>
BARBARA: You know, it's quite dark outside. Have you looked through
this one? <br>
IAN: No. <br>
(The noises start) <br>
IAN: What's that? <br>
BARBARA: I don't know. It sounds like whispering. He said it would
begin when darkness came. That must be what Susan heard. <br>
IAN: Well, what's causing it? <br>
BARBARA: Shush. Listen. It's like someone trying to get in. <br>
IAN: You said that when we were outside, about the jungle. <br>
BARBARA: But it couldn't, Ian, it couldn't. <br>
(Tendrils are pushing through the walls) <br>
IAN: Look! Oh, Barbara, don't you see? It's what he meant. Tempo of
destruction. It would normally take fifty or a hundred years for a
jungle to overrun this place. Now the whole process has been
accelerated. <br>
BARBARA: You mean the jungle is attacking us? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
(Barbara's ankles get grabbed by a vine, and while he is freeing her,
Ian spots the label on a broken glass jar - NH4NO3) <br>
IAN: Look, Barbara. It's a chemical formula! DE3O2. The micro-key's in
one of these jars. Come on! Quickly, find it. <br>

VASAR: Yes, there are more than ever of them this winter. I've counted
a dozen packs, twenty in each. They're hungry. They're even raiding the
villages at night. <br>
BARBARA: Are we in a village? <br>
VASAR: No, the nearest village is three miles away. I stay out here to
look after my traps. <br>
IAN: Well, we're grateful to you, getting to us before the wolves. <br>
VASAR: One of you would have died anyway if it hadn't been for the
stranger. Couldn't carry you both. <br>
BARBARA: Stranger? What stranger? <br>
VASAR: A madman. Came in here early last night, raving and ranting. I
couldn't talk to him. Gave him some clothes and went with him up the
mountain. He was searching for a couple of girls. <br>
IAN: Altos! <br>
BARBARA: Where is he now? <br>
VASAR: In the village, I think. After we got you back here, I think he
went out. <br>
BARBARA: Did he say he was coming back? <br>
VASAR: Yes, but it's getting nearly dark. He won't be able to get over
the ledge at night. <br>
IAN: We must go and help him. <br>
VASAR: There's a storm coming up. <br>
IAN: You've already done so much for us. I can't ask you to risk coming
with me, but will you lend me warm clothing? <br>
VASAR: Lend you? My furs are my living. I'm a poor man. I wouldn't have
much chance of getting them back if you fall down a crevice. <br>
IAN: I can't pay you for them. I haven't got any money. <br>

return for these, and I left them there. <br>

VASAR: He forced me to go up the mountain to look for these girls.
Instead we found you. And when we'd brought you back here he wanted to
go out again. <br>

TARRON: You could not have come through that door unless the guard on
duty in here let you in. <br>
IAN: It was open. I've already told you. <br>
TARRON: This is a maximum security vault. No one is admitted until
they've undergone a complete probity check. There's no record of you
ever having completed such a check. <br>

tricked the guard there or you were in league with him. <br>

make my report complete if you would tell me how you got rid of the

case before someone hit me on the back of the head. <br>
TARRON: While you were unconscious, my men searched the room. They
searched you and the body of the guard. They didn't find it. Now, what
did you do with it? <br>

IAN: But there was another man in here. I've got a lump on the back of
my head to prove it. <br>
TARRON: The dead man could have hit you before he was killed. <br>
IAN: I suppose I killed him while I was unconscious. <br>
TARRON: Well it does suggest you had an accomplice, I agree. So you had
better produce him. That's my advice to you, for what it's worth. <br>
IAN: I don't have to produce him, Tarron. You do. This is
circumstantial evidence. You must prove that I did the actual killing. <br>
TARRON: That is contrary to our legal system. <br>
IAN: What? <br>
TARRON: I mean that you are already guilty of this crime. The burden of
defence is entirely yours. You must prove without any shadow of doubt
that you are innocent, otherwise <br>
IAN: Otherwise? <br>

JUDGE: Our decision on the report of Chief Enquirer Tarron is that the
prisoner, Ian Chesterton, is guilty of murder and that his sentence is
death. The said sentence to be administered three days after the end of
this hearing, unless the representative for the accused can show
positive proof why the execution should not be carried out. Will you
stand up? <br>
(The Doctor stands) <br>
JUDGE: Representative for the defence, you have a grave duty. You have
offered your services in this matter, which complies with the law of
the city of Millenius, in that any person may speak on behalf of
another. Are you acquainted with our laws? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I have studied some, my Lord. <br>
JUDGE: Every latitude will be allowed to you, and if you are at fault,
I will give you directions. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
JUDGE: The representative of the court, Eyesen, has spoken his facts.
You may now reply. <br>
DOCTOR: My Lords, I cannot defend a man when I have not considered
every aspect of the case. I must have time to examine witnesses, read
statements and to prepare my case. <br>
EYESEN: I object most strongly. <br>
JUDGE: The demand is reasonable in itself. The crime of murder in
Millenius is in itself unusual. Then I grant you two days. <br>

ALTOS: Yes. You found him, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I had met him and arranged to take the micro-key, but
something must have happened. That's why he tried to take the key
earlier than we'd arranged. <br>
SABETHA: And he was killed? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. He must have told his plans to someone else and that
someone else killed him and took the key. <br>
IAN: Then all we have to do is find out who took the key and why. <br>
ALTOS: In two days. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we shall need every minute of that. Now, we must all take

there was blood on it. Chesterton was on the floor, unconscious. Either
he slipped and bumped his head, or Eprin had got a blow in before he
died. <br>
BARBARA: And the key was gone, you say. <br>
TARRON: Yes, and that's the only element of the case I don't
understand. My men did a heat reflector search of this room. It is
absolutely certain that the micro-key isn't in here. It is equally
certain that it's not been taken from here. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come now, Tarron. We're not dealing in magic, you know.
It's obvious to me the key must have been taken from this room. <br>
TARRON: No. every person that came in here was checked by the autho-ray
scanner as they went out. If anyone had the key on them, the scanner
would have detected it. <br>
SUSAN: Supposing the murderer hid the key on the body? <br>
TARRON: The body was searched. It wasn't there. <br>
DOCTOR: Then would you mind telling us what happened after the alarm
bell went, please? <br>
TARRON: Well, the relief guard was the first to reach the outside of
the door. He was joined almost immediately by the Controller and a
Guardian who was on patrol outside. When I reached the door, it was
opened and, well, you know what we found inside. <br>
SUSAN: That's fantastic. It couldn't disappear into thin air. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely, and I rather gather when we discover its location we
shall also discover the real identity of the murderer. <br>
TARRON: But we know the murderer. It was Chesterton. <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Tarron, I wonder if you'd mind leaving us alone for a
few moments. We'd like to discuss the aspects of this case. <br>
TARRON: Very well. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(Tarron leaves) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, hmm. <br>
BARBARA: Any ideas? Well? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
BARBARA: Have you any ideas how the key got out of here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well, elementary, elementary. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, do you mean you know? How? Where? <br>
DOCTOR: All in good time, my child. The important is I believe I know
who did the killing. <br>
BARBARA: But how? Tarron's been working on it all day. You've only been
here a few minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: You see, Tarron never doubted that Chesterton was guilty. A
grave error. Yes, a very grave error. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, where as we know he's innocent. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. But someone did it, and we also know there was a
third man in the room. How he got in here we shall know in a moment.
Now let us assume he was hiding. Yes. Behind this door. Now, Barbara,
you imagine that you are Chesterton for a moment. Come here. Now
please, you look into the room, you see a body on the floor. What do
you do? <br>
BARBARA: I'd see if I could help. <br>
SUSAN: I'll be the body. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Right, now let me see you do it. There's a weapon beside
the body. Do you examine it? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, yes, I think I would. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Then you look up in front of you and you see exactly what
you came here for, the micro-key. Unbeknown to you, the third man comes
out of hiding, creeps up behind you, and you are struck down, so. Now,
he could take what he came here for. He opens the case, lifts the key,
the alarm bell sounds. Now, he only has a few seconds so he conceals
the key, runs to the door, opens it, gets out and then closes it. But
he can't go any further because already the security guards and
officials are on their way. So he decides to pretend that he is first
on the scene! <br>
SUSAN: The relief guard! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, of course. That's why the guard inside let him in in the
first place. He knew him. He even expected him. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he went in, killed his colleague, heard Chesterton in the
hall, hid behind the door and the rest we know. <br>
SUSAN: That must be how it happened. I'll go and tell Tarron. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear child, this is only a theory. We must have proof. <br>
BARBARA: But surely, if you know where the key is, that's proof. <br>
DOCTOR: If Tarron were to know that now, his case against Chesterton
would be complete. I can't prove at this very moment that Chesterton
didn't hide in its present location. <br>
BARBARA: Oh. What do we do, then? <br>

very, very interesting. </font></p>

EYESEN: Still in the place where it was hidden by the murderer
Chesterton. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come now. Surely you don't think that he's still guilty? I
admit that I resorted to a subterfuge when Sabetha accused Ayden of
taking the key, but I think the results justifies the means. <br>
JUDGE: There are a number of other points which we'd like to see
cleared up. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, my Lord. <br>
JUDGE: First of all. <br>
(We switch to another part of the courtroom) <br>
TARRON: Yes, and I'm having psychometric tests made on the weapon that
killed Ayden. <br>
IAN: What exactly are these psychometric tests? <br>
TARRON: Its the science psychometry. Experts are able to divine from an
object the characteristics of the person who last had contact with that
object. <br>
BARBARA: Well that sounds an improvement on fingerprints. <br>
TARRON: Fingerprints? <br>
BARBARA: It's not important. <br>
IAN: Whoever killed Ayden must have been implicated in the theft. Had
he lived, he might have told us everything. <br>
BARBARA: It was his wife I felt sorry for. <br>
TARRON: The doctors have given her oblivative drugs and sent her home
to rest. She was hysterical. You'd better resume your places, the
tribunal is about to start again. <br>
ALTOS: Where's Susan? <br>
BARBARA: She's gone to get Ian's statement. <br>
JUDGE: It is clear that Aydon was involved in either the theft or the
killing. It is also clear that he had an accomplice. Bearing in mind
that the accused came here with the express purpose of recovering the
micro-key, and remembering the evidence against him, his guilt becomes
even more obvious. Will the prosecutor please summarise. <br>
EYESEN: Despite the dramatics and hysterics of recent events, very
little has changed. I submit that the accused did, by threat or
coercion, involve Ayden in the murder and robbery. His last dying words
were, they made me do it. They were the accused and his accomplices.
They were standing near him when he was killed. One of them is
responsible for his death. <br>
(During this speech, a Guardian has whispered to Barbara, and she,
Altos and Sabetha have got up and left) <br>
EYESEN: I submit that the defence has offered no new evidence, and the
sentence of the tribunal should be carried out. <br>
JUDGE: The tribunal concurs. Though it has deprived us of more detailed
evidence, the unfortunate death of Guardian Ayden has surely not
affected the issue. We will now hear a statement, a closing statement,
from the defence. <br>
DOCTOR: I beg the indulgence of the tribunal, and ask for time to
produce new evidence. <br>
JUDGE: Denied. No purpose would be served in delaying these proceedings
further. If you have nothing to add, the accused will be taken from
here and executed in the prescribed manner. </font></p>

ALTOS: You're thinking of the Doctor. <br>
BARBARA: He mustn't know anything about this. He must keep his mind
absolutely clear in order to concentrate on Ian. Anyway, how do we know
that Tarron isn't implicated? Who'd suspect the Chief Investigator? He
was next to Ayden in court when he was killed. <br>
SABETHA: What do we do, Barbara? <br>
BARBARA: We find Susan ourselves. <br>
ALTOS: And remember, whoever is behind this kidnapping is either in
league with the murderer, or is the murderer. <br>
BARBARA: Trouble is, where to begin? Best thing we can do is to go over
everything that's happened to us since we landed in Millenius. There's
a link somewhere, and it's probably the one and only way to save Ian. </font></p>

I wish I could say the same thing about Chesterton. <br>
ALTOS: But surely they'll stop the execution now that Kala's confessed.

DOCTOR: I hope so. I sincerely hope so. Well? Well! <br>
TARRON: Kala's made a full statement. She's named her accomplice. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Then you can stay the execution. <br>
TARRON: No, I can't. Kala's sworn testimony states that the man she was
working with was Ian Chesterton. <br>
DOCTOR: Impossible! <br>
BARBARA: But she's lying. <br>
TARRON: Yes, I have doubts myself. She's a vicious, dangerous woman,
but just doubts aren't enough to ask for a stay of execution. They'd
need positive proof. <br>

tell her to kill me. <br>
TARRON: Did you recognise the voice? <br>
SUSAN: No. <br>

pick her up. <br>

understand? The villain that planned all this, the one who planned this
whole affair, is now planning to collect the key! What a wonderful
opportunity it gives us to catch him red-handed. And to release
Chesterton! <br>

were hiding behind the desk. The Doctor turns on the lights and removes
his hood) <br>

the mace to reveal) <br>
SUSAN: The key! <br>
IAN: How did you know it was there, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: It had to be. I knew it all along. Until we knew the culprit,
the information was no good. <br>
TARRON: Everyone and everything that went in and out of that vault was
checked. Everything except this mace. <br>
BARBARA: Have you any idea why they did it? <br>
TARRON: Oh, yes, they've owned up to everything. Kala and the
Prosecutor had planned to steal the key and sell it, and Chesterton
here just happened to walk right into the middle of it. They made him
look so guilty I never doubted for a moment he was the one. <br>

asset to your business. <br>

it doesn't matter. The machine's power will spread through the planet.
There is no escape now except for us. I will bring them back with this.

travellers find the door out of the building just as it starts to fall
down. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SUSAN: Everything all right, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, my child. Chase the others up, will you? <br>
SUSAN: Right. (leaves) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm glad to have this moment alone with you, Sabetha. I want to
speak of your father. You know, he was a very wise and brilliant man,
and I know how you felt when you learned of his death. <br>
SABETHA: His life's work destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I wouldn't say that. His work will go on, only not
quite in the same way. But I don't believe that man was made to be
controlled by machines. Machines can make laws, but they cannot
preserve justice. Only human beings can do that. Now I only hope that
you'll carry on his good work, please. Goodbye. Bless you, my child. <br>
(The Doctor enters the Tardis) <br>
SUSAN: What are you going to do now? <br>
ALTOS: We might well return to the city of Millenius. <br>
SABETHA: We still have our travel dials. It's a good place to start. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Susan! <br>
SUSAN: We've got to go now. Bye, Sabetha. <br>
SABETHA: Goodbye, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Goodbye, Altos. <br>
ALTOS: Goodbye, Susan. <br>
(Susan enters the Tardis) <br>
IAN: What shall I do with this key? The one I didn't give to Yartek. <br>
ALTOS: Why don't you give it to the Doctor. <br>
BARBARA: That's a good idea. <br>
IAN: All right, I will. <br>
ALTOS: Goodbye, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: Goodbye, Altos. <br>
SABETHA: We shall think of you often. <br>
ALTOS: Ian. <br>
IAN: Goodbye, Altos. Goodbye, Sabetha. <br>
(Ian enters the Tardis) <br>
BARBARA: Take care, Altos. <br>
ALTOS: You may depend on that. <br>
BARBARA: Oh dear, I shall miss them. <br>
IAN: Come on, Barbara. <br>
