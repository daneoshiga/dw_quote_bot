the road from groups of terraced houses.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, Amy, it's definitely not the fifth moon of Cindie Colesta.
I think I can see a Ryman's. <br>

Tardis dematerialises.) <br>

houses when he hears a voice.) <br>
MAN [OC]: Hello? Hello, please? Hello? I need your help. There's been
an accident. Please, help me. <br>
(The young man goes up to the door, which has a cat flap in it. The
voice is coming from the intercom for the two flats, 79a and 79b. The
door is electronically opened.)

CRAIG: What's what on the ceiling? <br>
SOPHIE: That. It's coming from upstairs. <br>
(A damp stain in the corner.) <br>
SOPHIE: Who lives up there again? <br>
CRAIG: Just some bloke. <br>
(The stain spreads.) <br>
CRAIG: So what's the plan tonight? Pizza, booze, telly? <br>
SOPHIE: Yeah, pizza, booze, telly. <br>
(Bang! upstairs.) <br>
SOPHIE: What is he doing up there? You put the advert up yet? <br>
CRAIG: Yeah, did it today, paper shop window. One furnished room
available immediately, shared kitchen, bathroom, with twenty seven year
old male, non-smoker, four hundred pound pcm, per calendar month, suit
young professional. <br>
SOPHIE: Mmm, sounds ideal. That's your mission in life, Craig. Find me
a man. <br>
CRAIG: Yeah, otherwise you'll have to settle for me. <br>
SOPHIE: You'll have to settle for me first. <br>
(Sophie answers her phone.) <br>
SOPHIE: Oh, Melina again. What? Right. Yeah, but I've kind of got
plans. No, it's nothing important, it's just Craig. <br>
(Craig sees the stain spreading again.) <br>
CRAIG: Oh, thanks, Soph. <br>
SOPHIE: Sorry. You know what I mean. Okay, I'll talk to Craig. Okay.
Now she's having a Dylan crisis on top of the Clare crisis. It could be
another all-nighter. I'm sorry, but I really should go. Do you mind if
I go? <br>
CRAIG: No, not at all. No, honestly. Course not. Go. <br>
SOPHIE: Because I could stay. <br>
CRAIG: No, go on. <br>
SOPHIE: I mean, we've got plans. <br>
CRAIG: Just pizza. <br>
SOPHIE: Yeah, it's just pizza. Okay, right, I'm going. <br>
CRAIG: All right, then. Well, er, I'll see you soon. <br>
SOPHIE: Yeah. <br>
CRAIG: All right. And give me a call, and I hope everything's okay. <br>
SOPHIE: Thanks, sorry. <br>
(Sophie leaves the flat and hears noises from upstairs, then footsteps.
She leaves the house.) <br>
CRAIG: Just tell her. Just tell her. I love you. I love you. Oh, just.
Hey, I don't know if you knew. Oh. <br>
(The doorbell rings.) <br>
CRAIG: Every time. <br>
(Sophie has left her keys behind on a fluffy pink key ring, so he picks
them up and goes to the front door.) <br>
CRAIG: I love you. I love you. </font></p>

CRAIG: I love you. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's good, because I'm your new lodger. Do you know,
this is going to be easier than I expected. <br>
(The Doctor takes the fluffy pink keys from Craig. There is a Bluetooth
device in his ear.) <br>
CRAIG: But I only put the advert up today. I didn't put my address. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, aren't you lucky I came along? More lucky than you know.
Less of a young professional, more of an ancient amateur, but frankly
I'm an absolute dream. <br>
CRAIG: Hang on a minute, mate. I don't know if I want you staying. And
give me back those keys. You can't have those. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, quite right. Have some rent. <br>
(The Doctor hands Craig a paper take-away bag with lots of twenty pound
notes in it.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's probably quite a lot, isn't it? Looks like a lot. Is it
a lot? I can never tell. <br>
(They go into the hallway. The lights upstairs are flickering.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't spend it all on sweets, unless you like sweets. I like
sweets. Ooo. <br>
(The Doctor gives Craig a couple of air kisses about six inches from
each cheek.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's how we greet each other nowadays, isn't it? I'm the
Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the
Doctor, too. Still don't know why. <br>
CRAIG: Craig Owens. The Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yep. Who lives upstairs? <br>
CRAIG: Just some bloke. <br>
DOCTOR: What's he look like? <br>
CRAIG: Normal. He's very quiet. <br>

DOCTOR: Ah. I suppose that's dry rot? <br>
CRAIG: Or damp. Or mildew. <br>
DOCTOR: Or none of the above. <br>
CRAIG: I'll get someone to fix it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the
Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor, don't call me the Rotmeister. This is
the most beautiful parlour I have ever seen. You're obviously a man of
impeccable taste. I can stay, Craig, can't I? Say I can. <br>
CRAIG: You haven't even seen the room. <br>
DOCTOR: The room? <br>
CRAIG: Your room. <br>
DOCTOR: My room? Oh, yes. My room. My room. Take me to my room. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Eighties decor.) <br>
CRAIG: Yeah, this is Mark's old room. He owns the place. Moved out
about a month ago. This uncle he'd never even heard of died and left a
load of money in the will. <br>
DOCTOR: How very convenient. This'll do just right. In fact. <br>
(Another loud crash from above. The Doctor tests the air with a damp
finger.) <br>
DOCTOR: No time to lose. I'll take it. Ah you'll want to see my
credentials. There. <br>
(The psychic paper gets passed behind the Doctor's back and shown to
Craig three times.) <br>
DOCTOR: National Insurance number. NHS number. References. <br>
CRAIG: Is that a reference from the Archbishop of Canterbury? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm his special favourite. Are you hungry? I'm hungry. <br>
CRAIG: I haven't got anything in.

omelette fines herbes, pour deux. So, who's the girl on the fridge? <br>
(A photograph of Craig and Sophie, along with the Vincent van Gogh
Self-portrait in Straw Hat postcard.) <br>
CRAIG: My friend. Sophie. <br>
DOCTOR: Girlfriend? <br>
CRAIG: A friend who is a girl. There's nothing going on. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's completely normal. Works for me. <br>
CRAIG: We met at work about a year ago, at the call centre. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh really, a communications exchange? That could be handy. <br>
CRAIG: Firm's going down though. The bosses are using a totally rubbish
business model. I know what they should do. I got a plan all worked
out. But I'm just a phone drone, I can't go running in saying I know
best. Why am I telling you this? I don't even know you. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've got one of those faces. People never stop blurting
out their plans while I'm around. <br>
CRAIG: Right. Where's your stuff? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, it'll materialise. If all goes to plan.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The omelettes have been demolished.) <br>
CRAIG: Oh, that was incredible. That was absolutely brilliant. Where
did you learn to cook? <br>
DOCTOR: Paris, in the eighteenth century. No, hang on, that's not
recent, is it? Seventeenth? No, no, no. Twentieth. Sorry, I'm not used
to doing them in the right order. <br>
CRAIG: Has anyone ever told you that you're a bit weird? <br>
DOCTOR: They never really stop. Ever been to Paris, Craig? <br>
CRAIG: Nah. I can't see the point of Paris. I'm not much of a
traveller. <br>
DOCTOR: I can tell from your sofa. <br>
CRAIG: My sofa? <br>
DOCTOR: You're starting to look like it. <br>
CRAIG: Thanks, mate, that's lovely. No, I like it here. I'd miss it,
I'd miss <br>
DOCTOR: Those keys. <br>
CRAIG: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You're sort of fondling them. <br>
CRAIG: I'm holding them. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
CRAIG: Anyway. These, these are your keys. <br>
DOCTOR: I can stay? <br>
CRAIG: Yeah, you're weird and you can cook. It's good enough for me.
Right. Outdoor, front door, your door. <br>
DOCTOR: My door. My place. My gaff. Ha ha! Yes. Me with a key. <br>
CRAIG: And listen, Mark and I, we had an arrangement where if you ever
need me out of your hair, just give me a shout, okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Why would I want that? <br>
CRAIG: In case you want to bring someone round. A girlfriend or, a
boyfriend? <br>
CRAIG: Oh, I will. I'll shout if that happens. Yes. Something like, I
was not expecting this! By the way, that. The rot. I've got the
strangest feeling we shouldn't touch it.

(The door they have just come through flickers on and off.) <br>

his sonic screwdriver.) <br>

Handsome of International Rescue. Please state the nature of your
emergency. <br>
AUTOPILOT: The ship has crashed. The crew are dead. A pilot is
required. <br>
DOCTOR: You're the emergency crash program. A hologram. What, you've
been luring people up here so you can try them out? <br>
(The hologram flickers between old man, young man and girl.) <br>
AUTOPILOT: You will help me. You will help me. You will help me. <br>
SOPHIE: Craig, what is this? Where am I? <br>
DOCTOR: Hush. Human brains aren't strong enough, they just burn. But
you're stupid, though. You just keep trying. <br>
AUTOPILOT: Seventeen people have been tried. Six billion four hundred
thousand and twenty six remain. <br>
SOPHIE: Seriously, what is going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, for goodness sake. The top floor of Craig's building is in
reality an alien space ship intent on slaughtering the population of
this planet. Any questions? No, good. <br>
SOPHIE: Yes, I have questions. <br>
AUTOPILOT: The correct pilot has now been found. <br>

Argh. No. No, I gave her the idea of leaving. It's a machine that needs
