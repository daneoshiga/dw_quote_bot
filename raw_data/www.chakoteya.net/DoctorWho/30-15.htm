<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (London, night. In a top-notch museum, armed
security guards are taking up their positions around a golden goblet on
a stand.) <br>
GUARD: Positions. <br>
(He enters the key code 654 into a pad and turns a lever. A series of
lasers surround the artefact.) <br>
GUARD: Night, boys. <br>
(He leaves. A hole is opened in the cupola overhead and a masked figure
lowers itself on a set of wires, switches the contents of a bag for the
goblet and goes back up. One of the guards hears a noise and turns
around to see a golden novelty cat waving a paw at him. The thief runs
along a corridor then takes off her mask. An alarm sounds and the
lights come on.)

next to what is presumably her
getaway car being arrested.) <br>
CHRISTINA: Sorry, lover. <br>
(She runs through the streets, seeing police everywhere.) <br>
POLICEMAN: We've got the place surrounded, sir. <br>
(The route 200 bus to Victoria pulls up at a stop.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHRISTINA: Hello. I'm so terribly sorry. That card
paying device thing. That's a Lobster card, am I right? <br>
DRIVER: Oyster card. <br>
CHRISTINA: Ah. Well, that's the problem, you see. I only use my Oyster
when there's an R in the month. <br>
DRIVER: It's April. <br>
(The policeman in charge is nearby.) <br>
MACMILLAN: Go, go, go. <br>
(Christina takes off her earrings.) <br>
CHRISTINA: Diamonds. Genuine. Drive. <br>
DRIVER: Works for me. <br>
POLICEMAN: No sign of her. <br>
(Christina takes her seat. A man in a long brown coat and wearing
plimsolls get on board.) <br>
DRIVER: You're just in time, mate. <br>
(The man swipes his card and the doors close. The bus moves off. The
man sits next to Christina and offers her a piece of his chocolate
egg.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor. Happy Easter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MACMILLAN: Right, close off the area. Get all these
people cleared. She has got to be here somewhere. <br>
POLICEMAN: Robinson, clear the roads. Get the whole place sealed off. <br>

MACMILLAN: She's on the bus! She's on the. Kevin, get the car. It's
definitely her. Come on. Move it. Jackson, follow that bus. </font></p>

Easter. I can never find it. It's always at a different time. Although
I remember the original. Between you and me, what really happened was. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh. Sorry, hold on to that for me. Actually, go on, have it.
Finish it. It's full of sugar and I'm determined to keep these teeth. <br>
(The Doctor produces a hand-held gizmo which has lit up.) <br>

strange. <br>

CHRISTINA: Right now, a way out would come in pretty handy. Can you
detect me one of those? <br>
(The West Indian couple sitting a little way behind on the other side
talk.) <br>
CARMEN: Lou, can you hear them? <br>
LOU: Hear what, sweetheart?&nbsp;<br>
CARMEN: The voices. So many voices calling to us. Calling so far. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, the little dish is going round. <br>
CHRISTINA: Fascinating. <br>
DOCTOR: And round. Whoa. <br>

CHRISTINA: Can't you turn that thing off? <br>

CHRISTINA: Christina. <br>
DOCTOR: Christina, hold on tight. Everyone, hold on! <br>

little bit further than Brixton. <br>

on a monitor. It chitters to its companion.) </font></p>

Three of them. <br>
BARCLAY: (a young black man) Like when all those planets were up in the
sky. <br>
NATHAN: But it was Earth that moved back then, wasn't it? <br>
BARCLAY: Oh, man, we're on another world. <br>
DRIVER: It's still intact, though. Not as bad as it looks, and the
chassis's still holding together. My boss is
going to murder me. <br>
ANGELA: Can you still drive it? <br>

(The Doctor sonics his spectacle lenses black and examines the sand
grains.) <br>
DOCTOR: Me too. <br>
CHRISTINA: And what's your name? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. <br>
CHRISTINA: Name, not rank. <br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor. <br>
CHRISTINA: Surname? <br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor. <br>
CHRISTINA: You're called the Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. <br>
CHRISTINA: That's not a name. That's a psychological condition. <br>
DOCTOR: Funny sort of sand, this. There's a trace of something else.
(he tastes it) Glah. Not good. <br>
CHRISTINA: Well, it wouldn't be. It's sand. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it tastes like. Never mind. <br>
CHRISTINA: What is it? What's wrong? <br>
BARCLAY: Hold on a minute. I saw you, mate. You had that thing, that
machine. Did you make this happen? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, humans on buses, always blaming me. Look, look, if you must
know, I was tracking a hole in the fabric of reality. Call it a hobby.
But it was a tiny little hole. No danger to anyone. Suddenly it gets
big, and we drive right through it. <br>
DRIVER: But then where is it? There's nothing. There's just sand. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. You want proof? We drove through this. <br>
(He throws a handful of sand into the air and a wibbly thing appears
both there and -)

DOCTOR: A door. A door in space. <br>
DRIVER: So what you're saying is, on the other side of that is home? We
can get to London through there? <br>
DOCTOR: The bus came through, but we can't. <br>
DRIVER: Well then, what are we waiting for? <br>
(The driver runs towards the wibbly thing.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, don't. <br>
DRIVER: I'm going home, mate! <br>
DOCTOR: I said don't. <br>
(The driver enters the wibbly thing and screams. We see him burn
briefly and his smoking bones totter out of the tunnel before
collapsing.) <br>
BARCLAY: He was a skeleton, man. He was bones. Just bones. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: It was the bus. Look at the damage. That
was the bus protecting us. Great big box of metal. <br>
CHRISTINA: Rather like a Faraday cage? <br>
NATHAN: Like in a thunderstorm, yeah? Safest place is inside a car,
because the metal conducts the lightning right through. We did it in
school. <br>
CHRISTINA: But if we can only travel back inside the bus? A Faraday
cage needs to be closed. That thing's been ripped wide open. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, slightly different dynamics with a wormhole. There's
enough metal to make it work, I think. I hope. <br>
CHRISTINA: Then we have to drive five tons of bus, which is currently
buried in the sand, and we've got nothing but our bare hands. Correct? <br>
DOCTOR: I'd say nine and a half tons, but the point still stands, yes. <br>
CHRISTINA: Then we need to apply ourselves to the problem with
discipline. Which starts with appointing a leader. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. At last. Thank you. So. <br>
CHRISTINA: Well, thank goodness you've got me. Everyone do exactly as I
say. Inside the bus immediately. <br>
NATHAN: Is it safe in there? <br>
CHRISTINA: I don't think anything's safe any more, but if it's a choice
between baking in there or roasting out here, I'd say baking is slower.
Come on. All of you. Right now. And you. The Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, ma'am. <br>
CHRISTINA: (to Barclay) Up. Come on. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHRISTINA: Point five. The crucial thing is, do not
panic. Quite apart from anything else, the smell of sweat inside this
thing is reaching atrocious levels. We don't need to add any more.
Point six. Team identification. Names. I'm Christina. This man is
apparently the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
CHRISTINA: And you? <br>
NATHAN: Nathan. <br>
BARCLAY: I'm Barclay. <br>
ANGELA: Angela. Angela Whittaker. <br>
LOU: My name's Louis. Everyone calls me Lou. And this is Carmen. <br>
CHRISTINA: Excellent. Memorise those names. There might be a test.
Point seven. Assessment and application of knowledge. Over to you, the
Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought you were in charge. <br>
CHRISTINA: I am. And a good leader utilises her strength. You seem to
be the brainbox. So, start boxing. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. So, the wormhole. We were in the wrong place at the
wrong time. It was just an accident. <br>
CARMEN: No, it wasn't. That thing, the doorway? Someone made it for a
reason. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you know? <br>
LOU: She's got a gift. Ever since she was a little girl, she can just
tell things. We do the lottery twice a week. <br>
CHRISTINA: You don't look like millionaires. <br>
LOU: No, but we win ten pounds. Every week, twice a week, ten pounds.
Don't tell me that's not a gift. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, Carmen. How many fingers am I holding up? <br>
(He has his hand behind his back.) <br>
CARMEN: Three. <br>
(He changes it.) <br>
CARMEN: Four. <br>
DOCTOR: Very good. Low level psychic ability, exacerbated by an alien
sun. What can you see, Carmen? Tell me, what's out there? <br>
CARMEN: Something, something is coming. Riding on the wind, and
shining. <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
CARMEN: Death. Death is coming. <br>
ANGELA: We're going to die. <br>
BARCLAY: I knew it, man. I said so. <br>
NATHAN: We can't die out here. No one's going to find us. <br>
CHRISTINA: This isn't exactly helping. <br>
BARCLAY: You can shut up too. We're not your soldiers. <br>
CHRISTINA: That's not doing any good. <br>
LOU: Quiet. <br>
NATHAN: Will we be bones, like the bus driver? <br>
CHRISTINA: Stop whimpering, all of you. <br>
DOCTOR: All right now, stop it. Everyone, stop it! Angela, look at me.
Angela? Angela? Answer me one question, Angela. That's it. At me, at
me. There we go. Angela, just answer me one thing. When you got on this
bus, where were you going? <br>
ANGELA: Doesn't matter now, does it? <br>
DOCTOR: Answer the question. <br>
ANGELA: Just home. <br>
DOCTOR: And what's home? <br>
ANGELA: Me and Mike. And Suzanne. That's my daughter. She's eighteen. <br>
DOCTOR: Suzanne. Good. What about you? <br>
BARCLAY: Don't know. Going round Tina's. <br>
DOCTOR: Who's Tina? Your girlfriend? <br>
BARCLAY: Not yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Good boy. What about you, Nathan? <br>
NATHAN: Bit strapped for cash. I lost my job last week. I was going to
stay in and watch TV. <br>
DOCTOR: Brilliant. And you two? <br>
LOU: I was going to cook. <br>
CARMEN: It's his turn tonight. Then I clear up. <br>
DOCTOR: What's for tea? <br>
LOU: Chops. Nice couple of chops and gravy. Nothing special. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's special, Lou. That is so special. Chops and gravy,
mmm. What about you, Christina? <br>
CHRISTINA: I was going so far away. <br>
DOCTOR: Far away. Chops and gravy. Watching TV. Mike and Suzanne and
poor old Tina. <br>
BARCLAY: Hey. <br>
DOCTOR: Just think of them. Because that planet out there, all three
suns, wormholes and alien sand, that planet is nothing. You hear me?
Nothing, compared to all those things waiting for you. Food and home
and people. Hold on to that, because we're
going to get there. I promise. I'm going to get you home. </font></p>

DOCTOR: That's my boys. See, we lay a flat surface between the bus and
the wormhole, like duckboards, and we reverse into it. <br>
CHRISTINA: Let some air out of the tyres. Just a little bit. It spreads
the weight of the bus, gives you more grip against the sand. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's good. <br>
CHRISTINA: Holidays in the Kalahari. <br>
BARCLAY: Yeah, but those wheels go deep. <br>

it's one button to start, the other one to stop, yeah? <br>

can. Back in two ticks. <br>

DOCTOR: Easier if you left that backpack behind. <br>
CHRISTINA: Where I go, it goes. <br>
DOCTOR: A backpack with a spade and an axe. Christina, who's going so
far away, and yet scared by the sound of a siren. Who are you? <br>
CHRISTINA: You can talk. Let's just say we're two equal mysteries. <br>
DOCTOR: We make quite a couple. <br>
CHRISTINA: We don't make any sort of couple, thank you very much. Come
on then. Tell me. If Carmen's right, if that wormhole's not an
accident, then what is it? Has someone done this on purpose? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but every single instinct of mine is telling me
to get off this planet right now. <br>
CHRISTINA: And do you think we can? <br>
DOCTOR: I live in hope. <br>
CHRISTINA: That must be nice. It's Christina de Souza. To be precise,

CHRISTINA; Seriously? The Lord of where? <br>
DOCTOR: It's quite a big estate. <br>

were carrying, and the wormhole. Like you knew. And the way you stride
around this place, like. <br>

you see what I mean. It's perfectly natural. They are flies. <br>

carrying a winch in her bag. <br>
CHRISTINA: No stranger than you, spaceman. <br>
DOCTOR: I had this friend, once. She called me spaceman. <br>
CHRISTINA: And was she right? Do you zoom about the place in a rocket? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a little blue box. Travels in more than space. It can
journey through time, Christina. Oh, the places I've been. World War
One. Creation of the universe. End of the universe. The war between
China and Japan. And the Court of King Athelstan in 924 AD. <br>
(He takes the stolen goblet out of her rucksack.) <br>
DOCTOR: But I don't remember you being there. So what are you doing
with this? <br>
CHRISTINA: Excuse me. A gentleman never goes through a lady's
possessions. <br>
DOCTOR: It's the Cup of Athelstan, given to the first King of Britain
as a coronation gift from Hywel, King of the Welsh. But it's been held
in the International Gallery for two hundred years, which makes you,
Lady Christina, a thief. <br>
CHRISTINA: I like to think I liberated it. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't tell me you need the money. <br>
CHRISTINA: Daddy lost everything. Invested his fortune in the Icelandic
banks. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. If you're short of cash, you rob a bank.
Stealing this? That's a lifestyle. <br>
CHRISTINA: I take it you disapprove? <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Except. That little blue box, I stole it from my
own people. <br>
CHRISTINA: Good boy. You were right. We're quite a team. <br>
(Roar.) <br>
CHRISTINA: What the blazes was that? <br>
DOCTOR: We never did find out why the ship crashed. Christina, I think
you should come back up. <br>
CHRISTINA: Too late. I can see it. <br>
DOCTOR: Careful. Slowly. Have you got an open-vent system? <br>
(The Tritovore chitters.) <br>
DOCTOR: I thought so. <br>
CHRISTINA: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It's like when birds fly into the engines of an aircraft. <br>
(Christina is within touching distance of the crystal when she sees a
steel stingray through the girders.) <br>
CHRISTINA: One of the creatures. <br>
DOCTOR: It got trapped in the vents, caused the crash. Christina, get
out. <br>
CHRISTINA: It's not moving. I think it's injured. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's dormant because it's so cold down there, but your body
heat is raising the temperature. <br>
CHRISTINA: I tend to have that effect. Almost there. <br>
DOCTOR: Not just the crystal. I need the whole bed, the plate thing. <br>
CHRISTINA: I've got it! <br>
(The Doctor sonics the pulley to pull her up fast, just as the stingray
moves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. It's
going to eat its way up. <br>
(Christina reactivates the security grid on her way past and the
stingray gets
zapped.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, she's good. <br>
(Christina returns to the top of the shaft.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's it, that's it, that's it. I've got you. I've got you.

CHRISTINA: What the hell was that? Is this place safe? It's the
creature. It's not dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe you didn't hit just one of them. If you hit a swarm? <br>
CHRISTINA: Do you mean if there's more on board? <br>
DOCTOR: This ship's built inside a metal sleeve. They can move through
the infrastructure, all around us. And those things wake up hungry.
Commander, you've got to come with us right now. <br>
CHRISTINA: Come back to Earth. We'll find you a home. <br>
DOCTOR: And that's the word of a lady. Come on. <br>
(One of the Tritovores goes to a control panel. The stingray appears
and eats him. The Commander raises his weapon.) <br>
