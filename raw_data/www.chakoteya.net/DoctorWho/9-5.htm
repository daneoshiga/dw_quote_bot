Doctor upright from his chaise longue on a mosaic floor. Either side of
an altar stand a pair of large Minoan quadruple-headed axes, and behind
them a giant complex crystal pulses.) <br>
MASTER: Welcome! Welcome to your new Master! <br>
(The Master breaks into maniacal laughter, a lightning bolt comes down
and he vanishes. Volcanic smoke fills the room, there are images of
ceremonial masks and Minoan gods and goddesses.) <br>

JO: Doctor. Doctor. Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I must have been dreaming. <br>
JO: I'll say you were. A real pippin of a dream. I've brought you a cup
of tea. Do you want it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Volcanoes and earthquakes. <br>
(The Doctor gets up, walks a few steps and hands the cup of tea back to
Jo.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. I enjoyed that. <br>
JO: Doctor, have you been working all night again? On that? I don't
know. What is anyway, a super dematerialisation circuit? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. No, that'll have to wait. No, this is far more
important. It might make all the difference the next time he turns up. <br>
JO: The next time who turns up? <br>
DOCTOR: The Master, of course. Jo, now listen to me. I want you to find
out as quickly as possible if there have been any volcanic eruptions or
severe earthquakes recently. It doesn't matter where. Anywhere in the
world. <br>
JO: You're joking, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Believe me, this is no matter for jokes. <br>
JO: But I read it all out to last night, I. Don't go away. <br>
(Jo fetches a newspaper from a table by the chaise longue.) <br>
JO: It just shows you don't listen to a word I say, doesn't it. Now,
yes, here we are. New eruptions in the Thera group of islands.
Somewhere off Greece. <br>
DOCTOR: Does it say anything about a crystal? <br>
JO: Crystal? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>
JO: No, what crystal? Look, I know I'm exceedingly dim, but would you
mind explaining?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: It was in my dream, Jo. There was a large crystal, shaped like
a trident.

held up by a man in a white coat and shown to his blonde lady
assistant.) <br>
MASTER: (with a very slight Greek accent) A simple piece of quartz,
nothing more. <br>
RUTH: But Professor Thascales, that is ridiculous. <br>
MASTER: Of course it is, Doctor Ingram. Of course it is. <br>
(The Master puts the crystal into a box-like device.) <br>
MASTER: You know, there is no means whereby I could prove to you that
that crystal is any different from any other piece of quartz, and yet
it is unique. As you say, ridiculous!

MASTER: Please do not call me Prof. <br>
HYDE: In the doghouse again. <br>
MASTER: Now quiet, both of you. Now listen. I have a meeting with the
new director in two and a half minutes, so I'm afraid I shall have to
leave the final tests for the demonstration to the two of you. <br>
RUTH: But aren't we going to have a trial run, Professor? <br>
MASTER: No, it's not necessary. <br>
HYDE: Well, that's marvellous. We're going to look a right bunch of
Charlies if this fellow from the Grants Committee turns up and we're
left with egg on our faces. <br>
RUTH: Yes, surely, Professor, it would be very unwise <br>
MASTER: Now look, my dear, there is no need for you to worry your
pretty little head. <br>
RUTH: And there's no need for you to be so patronising, Professor.
Look, just because I'm a woman, there's no need to treat me like <br>
HYDE: Here we go. <br>
MASTER: No, no, no, I'm sorry, you're quite right, Doctor. Please
forgive me. And now, er, would you please run those tests? <br>
(The Master leaves.) <br>
RUTH: That man. You know, I don't what infuriates me more. His
dictatorial manner or that infernal courtesy of his. It's all the same,
really. A bland assumption of male superiority. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, let's forget all about it, Jo, shall we? I just had a
nightmare, that's all. <br>
JO: Sorry, Mike. <br>
YATES: Better than hanging round the duty room. If nothing turns up
soon, I'll go round the twist. <br>
JO: That makes two of us. Here was I, all ready for a nice little trip
to Atlantis. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
JO: Well, nothing. I was just saying to Mike <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I heard what you said, but you said Atlantis. Why
Atlantis? <br>
JO: Well, that's what it says in the paper. <br>
DOCTOR: Give me that map, Captain Yates. <br>
JO: Yes, here we are. Believed by many modern historians to be all that
remains of Plato's metropolis of Atlantis. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. Of course. <br>
YATES: Atlantis? I thought that was supposed to be in the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean? <br>
JO: You're a bit out of date. Apparently it was part of the Minoan
civilisation. Oh, you know, the Minotaur and all the Cretan jazz. <br>
YATES: It's only a legend though, isn't it? <br>

Institute - actually Swallowfield Park, Berkshire.) <br>
BRIGADIER: In any case, Doctor, every section of UNIT now has the
search for the Master written into standing orders. <br>
DOCTOR: Priority Z one hundred and forty four, I suppose? <br>
BRIGADIER: Priority A one, actually. <br>

BRIGADIER: You know, if this got out, you'd be the laughing stock of
UNIT. A dream. Really, Doctor, you'll be consulting the entrails of a
sheep next. <br>
(Jo laughs.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Right, we'd better be on our way to the Newton Institute.
Ready, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I can't go anywhere at the moment. I'm far too busy. <br>
BRIGADIER: But I told them you'd be coming. Two observers from UNIT,
they said. <br>
JO: Oh, shall I go? <br>
DOCTOR: No, certainly not, Jo. I shall need you here with me. <br>
JO: Well, what's it all about anyway? <br>
BRIGADIER: TOM-TIT, that's what it's all about. A demonstration of
TOM-TIT. <br>
YATES: TOM-TIT? What on earth does that stand for? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, it's the, er, the trans <br>
DOCTOR: Transmission Of Matter Through Interstitial Time. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, exactly what I was going to say. TOM-TIT. <br>
JO: Well, what does it do? <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, it's a brilliant idea. Apparently it can break down
solid objects into light-waves or whatever, and transmit them from one
place to another. <br>
YATES: And it works? <br>
BRIGADIER: Apparently. Well, Yates, I suppose you'd better come with
me. <br>
YATES: Sorry, sir. I'm Duty Officer. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, someone's got to come. <br>
(Benton enters, in ordinary clothes and carrying a bag.) <br>
BENTON: I'm just leaving, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah, Sergeant Benton. The very man. <br>
BENTON: But I'm just off on a forty eight hour pass, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh no, you're not, Sergeant. You're coming for a little trip
to the Newton Institute. <br>
BENTON: Yes, sir. The where, sir? The Newton Institute? <br>
BRIGADIER: That's right. It's a research establishment at Wootton, just
outside Cambridge.

MASTER: A charlatan? How dare you. <br>
PERCIVAL: Doctor Cook is not only chairman of the Grants Committee, but
a colleague and a personal friend. Am I to tell him this afternoon that
I am as gullible as that drunkard I have replaced? How is it that I can
find no trace of your academic career before you visited Athens
University, Professor? How is it that you publish nothing? That you
refuse to reveal the hypothesis behind your so-called experiment? That
the very name of your project is arrogant nonsense! TOM-TIT! What,
pray, is interstitial time? <br>

to tell you everything. Oh, yes, you're perfectly right. I am no
professor. <br>
PERCIVAL: Ah, say no more. <br>

MASTER: But there is nothing to worry about. You must believe me. You
must believe me. You must believe me. <br>

PERCIVAL: Must believe you. <br>
MASTER: I am the Master. You will listen to me, and you will obey me.
You will obey me! <br>
PERCIVAL: Obey. Obey. I will obey. <br>

arrival of this wretched man from London. And remember you are
perfectly satisfied as to the authenticity of my credentials, and the

Brothers, should I listen to this man? <br>

alongside Galleia, and bows.) <br>

was perched halfway up the top of a mountain. And behind our house,
there sat under a tree an old man, a hermit, a monk. He'd lived under
this tree for half his lifetime, so they said, and he'd learned the
secret of life. So, when my black day came, I went and asked him to
help me. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, I'm coming to that, Jo, in my own time. Ah, I'll never
forget what it was like up there. All bleak and cold, it was. A few
bare rocks with some weeds sprouting from them and some pathetic little
patches of sludgy snow. It was just grey. Grey, grey, grey. Well, the
tree the old man sat under, that was ancient and twisted and the old
man himself was, he was as brittle and as dry as a leaf in the autumn. <br>
JO: But what did he say? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing, not a word. He just sat there, silently,
expressionless, and he listened whilst I poured out my troubles to him.
I was too unhappy even for tears, I remember. And when I'd finished, he
lifted a skeletal hand and he pointed. Do you know what he pointed at? <br>
JO: No. <br>
DOCTOR: A flower. One of those little weeds. Just like a daisy, it was.
Well, I looked at it for a moment and suddenly I saw it through his
eyes. It was simply glowing with life, like a perfectly cut jewel. And
the colours? Well, the colours were deeper and richer than you could
possibly imagine. Yes, that was the daisiest daisy I'd ever seen. <br>
JO: And that was the secret of life? A daisy? Honestly, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I laughed too when I first heard it. So, later, I got up
and I ran down that mountain and I found that the rocks weren't grey at
all, but they were red, brown and purple and gold. And those pathetic
little patches of sludgy snow, they were shining white. Shining white
in the sunlight. You still frightened, Jo? <br>
JO: No, not as much as I was. <br>
DOCTOR: That's good. I'm sorry I brought you to Atlantis. <br>
JO: I'm not. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(The door opens.) <br>
GUARD: Inside, old man! <br>
DALIOS: I demand to be taken to the Lady Galleia! <br>
GUARD: You'll do as you're told. <br>
DALIOS: How dare you lay your hands on me! I shall see the Queen! Out
of my way, slave! <br>
(Dalios raises his hand and the guard hits him with his trident. Dalios
falls and the guard locks the door again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Dalios! Dalios! <br>
DALIOS: Who would have thought it. My sweet Queen. <br>
DOCTOR: Is the Master responsible for this? <br>
DALIOS: Aye, but tis no matter. Come closer. <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
DALIOS: There's so little time. So little. I tell you the vision of a
dying man. Atlantis was doomed. You are a true philosopher. The world
must be, must be saved. And you are the one to do it. The only one.
Who'd have thought it? My lovely Galleia. <br>
(Dalios dies in Jo's lap.) <br>
DOCTOR: Dalios! We won't fail you, Dalios.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Atlantis plaza]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Morning, and the council has been summoned. The
surviving prisoners are fastened either side of the dais.) <br>
CRITO: Silence! The Lady Galleia, Queen of Atlantis, now speaks. <br>
GALLEIA: Brethren of the council, my faithful few. Our troubles are now
at an end. No longer shall we fret beneath the hand of an old, defeated
king. I shall present to you his holiness, the most venerable, Lord
Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite above himself, isn't he. <br>
CRITO: Silence! <br>
MASTER: Greetings to you, my brothers. I grieve to see the council is
so small. And yet I rejoice that you, the few who have put me here,
have come to claim your just reward. Today, you shall see the Mighty
One himself. Kronos, the most terrible. Krasis, the high priest will
assist me. Prepare, Krasis. <br>
(The part of TOM-TIT that the Master brought from the lab, containing
the fragment of crystal, is in the plaza. The larger crystal is with
it. Krasis operates the device.) <br>
DOCTOR: What happened to the rest of the council? <br>
JO: Yes, where are they? <br>
DOCTOR: Are they alive? <br>
MASTER: The point is academic, Doctor. In a few moments, it'll be of no
further interest to you. <br>
DOCTOR: Then satisfy my curiosity now. Are they indeed alive, or are
they dead like King Dalios? <br>
GALLEIA: The King is unharmed. <br>
DOCTOR: The King is dead, Madame. <br>
JO: It's true. We were there when he died this morning. <br>
GALLEIA: You were there? You saw him? Is this true? Is this true? Is
the lord Dalios, your King, no longer alive? Answer me. <br>
MASTER: He died this morning. He was an old man. <br>
DOCTOR: And you were responsible for his death! <br>
GUARD: Quiet! <br>
GALLEIA: You promised. <br>
MASTER: I promised you power, and you shall have it. Power to realise
your most ambitious dreams! <br>
GALLEIA: You promised he should not be harmed! <br>
MASTER: He was an old man. And he was stubborn! <br>
(Galleia slaps the Master.) <br>
GALLEIA: Oh, you! Seize him! Seize him! <br>
MASTER: Krasis, the switch! <br>
DOCTOR: No, stop him! Stop him! <br>
(Too late. The white creature appears in the plaza) <br>
MASTER: Kronos! I, the Master, welcome you! I, the Master, bid you do
my will! I command you to destroy these men! Obey me! I command you! I
order you to obey! <br>
(Kronos hovers over the plaza.) <br>
DOCTOR: He'll never obey you. Don't you understand yet what you've
done? He's uncontrollable! <br>
MASTER: Obey! <br>
(Lightning flashes and the buildings start to fall. People scream and
the Master breaks free of the guards and runs over to grab the large
crystal.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jo! Jo, come back! Jo! Jo! <br>
(The Master gets the large crystal just as Jo leaps onto his back. He
carries her and the crystal into his Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come back, Jo! Come back! Jo! Come back.&nbsp;<br>
(The Master's Tardis dematerialises. Galleia frees the Doctor, who runs
into his own Tardis to follow. Kronos continues to shriek in the air
above Atlantis.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Master handcuffs Jo to the console.) <br>
MASTER: There, Miss Grant. I think we've seen the last of the Doctor.
Buried for all time under the ruins of Atlantis. You know, I'm going to
miss him. <br>
JO: He's not finished. I just know it. <br>
MASTER: Of course he is. <br>
JO: No, you're the one who's finished! Do you think that, that creature
out there will ever let you control it? <br>
MASTER: I do so already. He came when I called. You saw that yourself. <br>
JO: Like a tiger comes when he hears a lamb bleating. <br>
MASTER: Nicely put, my dear. You know, that was worthy of the late
lamented Doctor himself. You know, I could kick myself for not having
polished him off long ago. Just think of the future. Dominion over all
time and all space. Absolute power forever. And no Doctor to ruin
things for me. <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: Don't worry, Jo. <br>
JO: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: I'll soon sort him out for you. <br>
MASTER: Doctor! Why, you must be as indestructible as that wretched
Tardis of yours! And how exactly do you propose to sort me out? <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: By making you see reason, and making you destroy
that crystal. <br>
MASTER: Oh? Why should I? I have my Tardis, I have Kronos and I have
Miss Grant. Now, my reason tells me that I hold all the cards. <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: Ah, but there's one card that you've forgotten. <br>
MASTER: Oh? <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: The trump card. I can stop you whenever I please. <br>
MASTER: You are bluffing, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: Am I? How about time ram? <br>
MASTER: Time ram? You couldn't do it in that old crock. <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: The two Tardis's are operating on the same
frequency, and our controls are locked together. See for yourself. <br>
(A dial moves up from 70 towards the warning and danger zones.) <br>
MASTER: Stop! <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: You know what'll happen if that control goes over
the safety limit, don't you. Tell him, Jo. <br>
JO: The two Tardis's occupy exactly the same space and time, and that
means that you go <br>
MASTER: I know very well what it means. <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: Do you? <br>
MASTER: Yes! Oblivion. <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: Top of the class. Extinction, total annihilation,
for you, the Tardis and the crystal. <br>
MASTER: And for you and Miss Grant. <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: Oh yes, of course. But by then, Kronos will be
free, and the universe will be saved. <br>
MASTER: Very well. Go ahead. <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: What? <br>
MASTER: Go ahead. Time ram! <br>
JO: You can't be serious? <br>
MASTER: Do you think I'm going to dance to the Doctor's tune like some
performing poodle? Look, Doctor, you want to stop me? Try! <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: Very well. Goodbye, Jo. <br>
(The dial climbs to 94, just below the red.) <br>
MASTER: Well? Why have you stopped? <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: To give you one last chance. <br>
MASTER: Nonsense! You can't bring yourself to destroy her. Now admit
it! It's that fatal weakness of yours, Doctor. Pity, compassion. You
know, for a moment there, you almost had me believing you. <br>
JO: Don't listen to him, Doctor! Think of all those millions of people
who'll die. Think of all those millions of people who'll never be born.
Do it, Doctor, quickly! <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: But Jo, there may be another way. <br>
MASTER: Of course there is. The way to immeasurable glory! JO: Goodbye,
Doctor! <br>
(Jo reaches for the dial.) <br>
MASTER: No! <br>
DOCTOR [on scanner]: Don't do it! <br>
JO: Too late! <br>
MASTER: No! <br>
(The time rotor turns into a bright light. The two Tardis's go quiet
and hang in nothingness. Jo and the Master are out cold on the floor.
She is no longer handcuffed to the console. Jo wakes first.) <br>
JO: Doctor. <br>
(Jo leaves the Master's Tardis and crosses the rainbow nothingness to
the police box.)

JO: Doctor? Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Jo. Are you all right? <br>
JO: I'm fine. Dead, of course, but I'm fine. <br>
DOCTOR: Dead? What are you talking about? You're no more dead than I
am. <br>
JO: Well, that's just it. Well, I mean, that's what I mean. I mean,
you're dead too, and so's the Master. <br>

heaven. <br>
JO: Well, where are we then? <br>

put us into time ram, Jo. In any case, I was just about to do it
myself. <br>
JO: Oh, really? <br>
DOCTOR: Now look, Jo, I. No, not really. <br>

DOCTOR: Greetings. <br>
KRONOS: Your courtesy is always so punctilious, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: You know me? <br>
KRONOS: Of old. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you must forgive me, but I can't quite place you. <br>
KRONOS: I am Kronos. <br>
JO: You? But you're a girl. <br>
KRONOS: Shapes mean nothing. <br>
JO: But a little while ago you were a raging monster and an evil
destroyer. <br>
KRONOS: I can be all things. A destroyer, a healer, a creator. I'm
beyond good and evil as you know it. <br>
DOCTOR: Where exactly are we? <br>
KRONOS: On the boundary of your reality and mine. You brought
yourselves here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the time ram. <br>
KRONOS: At the moment of impact, I was released. That saved you and
took you to the threshold of being. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what now? <br>
KRONOS: I owe you a debt of gratitude nothing could repay. What would
you wish? <br>
JO: To go home. <br>
DOCTOR: In the Tardis. <br>
KRONOS: You shall. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
JO: But what about the Master? <br>
KRONOS: He stays. <br>
JO: And what will happen to him? <br>
KRONOS: Torment, of course. The pain he has given so freely will be
returned to him, in full. <br>
(The Master comes out of his computer.) <br>
MASTER: No! <br>
(The Master falls to his knees.) <br>
MASTER: Doctor, please. Please help me. I can't bear it. Please,
Doctor, please. <br>
DOCTOR: Mighty Kronos, may I ask one last favour of you? <br>
KRONOS: Name it. <br>
DOCTOR: His life. His freedom. <br>
KRONOS: He made a prisoner of me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But would you allow us to deal with him in our
way? <br>
KRONOS: I do not understand you, but if that is your desire, so let it
be. <br>
MASTER: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't thank me. You're coming back to Earth with us. <br>
MASTER: Yes, of course. <br>
(The Doctor turns and goes into the Tardis. The Master pushes Jo and
runs back to his own.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! No! Kronos, stop him! Stop him, Kronos! <br>
(The Master's Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
KRONOS: You asked for him to be given his freedom. He has it. <br>
