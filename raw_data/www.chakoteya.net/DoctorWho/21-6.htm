<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises in a dry, sandy place,
played by a quarry at Stokeford Heath, Dorset. Off in the distance,
buttes of harder rock stand proud in the eroded landscape.) <br>
PERI [OC]: The tide's out. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Hmm? <br>
PERI [OC]: When you said sand, I thought maybe I could take a dip. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: You're a little late, Peri. It's about a billion years
since there was any sea on Androzani Minor. <br>
PERI [OC]: You're such a pain, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. Well, well, well. The old place hasn't changed at all.
Still nothing but sand. <br>
PERI: Oh, wow! This place, Doctor, it's just unbelievable! Doctor,
look! <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
PERI: Glass. <br>
DOCTOR: Almost, anyway. It's fused silica. And I'm not a pain. Here's
some more. Now, why would anyone come here? <br>
PERI: Who said they have? <br>
DOCTOR: These patches were fused by the rocket pads of a spacecraft.
Too small for interstellar travel, so it obviously came from the twin
planet of Androzani Major. The interesting question is, why? <br>
PERI: Maybe someone wanted some sand to make some glass so they could
blow a new vacuum tube for their reticular vector gauge. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sarcasm is not your strong point, Peri. If I were you I'd
stick. Ah-ha! What have we here? <br>
PERI: Ah-ha? I'm looking. Why am I looking? <br>
DOCTOR: A monoskid. You can see the deep furrow where it left the ship
then the shallower one when it returned. <br>
PERI: Or vice versa. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. You can see where the light track sometimes crosses
the heavy one. So, someone came here with a heavily laden monoskid,
unloaded it somewhere and then returned to the ship. <br>
PERI: So you got a merit badge in tracking when you were a boy scout.
I'm suitably impressed. Can we go now? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, one moment. Looks as if the tracks lead to those caves over
there. <br>
PERI: Is this wise, I ask myself? Oh well. <br>
(They follow the tracks some way.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, blow holes. <br>
PERI: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Now we're near you can see they're not caves, they're blow
holes. <br>
PERI: Well, same difference. <br>
DOCTOR: Not to a speleologist. And not if you're stuck in one of those
things at high tide. <br>
PERI: High tide? I thought you said that <br>
DOCTOR: It's a figure of speech. You see, the core of this planet is
superheated primeval mud. When its orbit takes it close to Androzani
Major, the gravitational pull <br>
PERI: Oh, I get the picture. Mud baths for everyone. Well, it's a
change from lava. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Presumably why the planet was never colonised. Androzani
Major was becoming quite developed the last time I passed this way. <br>
PERI: When was that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't remember. I'm pretty sure it wasn't the future. <br>
PERI: You're a very confusing person to be with, Doctor, you know that?
<br>
DOCTOR: I tried keeping a diary once. Not chronological, of course, but
the trouble with time travel is one never seems to find the time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Somewhere, three men are measuring and mapping a
tunnel when one of them is attacked by something very large. The other
two fire automatic weapons at it then run. <br>
The Doctor and Peri pick their way carefully down one of the blow
holes.) <br>
PERI: Where's the light coming from? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, natural phosphorescence. There's a crystalline
material in these walls. It's polished smooth as glass. <br>
PERI: Which reminds me why we came here, and it wasn't to go Argh! <br>
(Behind the Doctor, Peri slips on the glassy surface and disappears
down a hole.) <br>
DOCTOR: Be careful not to slip. Oh. <br>
(He goes to help her. Peri has landed with a leg in some yukky goo.) <br>
DOCTOR: Keep still. All right, give me your hand. Come on, up. <br>
PERI: It's horrid. What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not edible, by the smell of it. It's probably quite
harmless. <br>
PERI: It's stinging. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't fall into any more, hmm? <br>
(They follow this new tunnel into a narrow cavern.) <br>
PERI: Doctor, why do you wear a stick of celery in your lapel? <br>
DOCTOR: Does it offend you? <br>
PERI: No, I'm just curious. <br>
DOCTOR: Safety precaution. I'm allergic to certain gases in the praxis
range of the spectrum. <br>
PERI: How does the celery help? <br>
DOCTOR: If the gas is present, the celery turns purple. <br>
PERI: And then what do you do? <br>
DOCTOR: I eat the celery. If nothing else, I'm sure it's good for my
teeth. </font></p>

is cleaning a weapon which includes three small canisters fastened
together.) <br>
KRELPER: The dummies should have been here yesterday. <br>
STOTZ: The last time we made a drop, we had to wait three days. So
what? It sure beats picking chacaws. <br>
KRELPER: Chacaws. I don't pick chacaws, Stotz. I've never been
confined, and you know why? Cos I'm smart. <br>
STOTZ: You, smart? Krelper, the wind whistles through your ears. <br>
KRELPER: Yeah? <br>
(Beep, beep.) <br>
STOTZ: Someone's coming. <br>
KRELPER: Should be the droids. Come on, belt plates. <br>
STOTZ: Krelper, it could also be the army. Let's move out of here. <br>
KRELPER: Come on! <br>
(Three more men follow the pair out. A little while later, the Doctor
and Peri stroll in. They are watched by people in uniform.) <br>
PERI: End of trail. <br>
DOCTOR: Gas carbines. <br>
(Peri opens a box.) <br>
PERI: Bombs. <br>
DOCTOR: Poison volatisers. Nasty little objects, aren't they. There are
enough hand weapons here to equip a small army. <br>
PERI: What do you make of it? You said nobody lives here. <br>
DOCTOR: I was wrong. This dice is still warm. <br>
PERI: Listen. <br>
DOCTOR: Boots coming this way. Quickly, over here. <br>
(They try to hide behind some munitions crates as a troop of men in red
and grey overalls, metal hard hats and carrying automatic weapons
enter. It is to no avail. The Doctor is quickly frisked.) <br>
PERI: Now what do we do? <br>
DOCTOR: Surrender. </font></p>

shoulders, is putting markers on a wall map. There is a knock at the

SALATEEN: A message from Captain Rones, sir. His men have just taken
two gun runners. <br>
CHELLAK: Good. Good. That's excellent. Well done Rones, eh? He's B
group, I think. <br>
SALATEEN: Yes, sir. <br>
CHELLAK: High time we had some success. Did they resist? <br>
SALATEEN: Apparently not. The patrol also captured a dump of gas
weapons. <br>
CHELLAK: Gas? <br>
SALATEEN: Rones suspects there are other runners in the area. He wants
to know if he should set up an ambush. <br>
CHELLAK: I think it's more important we should seize these weapons,
Major Salateen. <br>
SALATEEN: Very good, sir. <br>
CHELLAK: If Sharaz Jek gets his hands on gas weapons, we'll be in a
devil of a stew. Could pin our fellows down for weeks. <br>
SALATEEN: We have gas suits in the stores, General. <br>
CHELLAK: A bad design. I've always said so. A few hours in one of those
things, you start to cook. Still, better have them checked ready for
issue. <br>
SALATEEN: It's being done, sir. <br>
CHELLAK: Ahead of me as usual, eh, Salateen. What about these
prisoners? </font></p>

assistant. She enters.) <br>
TIMMIN: Yes, sir? <br>
MORGUS: Krau Timmin, copper output has risen by thirteen percent. That
should not have occurred. <br>
TIMMIN: Head of Minerals sent out a limiting order last month, sir. <br>
MORGUS: Too little, too late. Tell him to fly out immediately to our
Northcawl mine. I want a feasibility study on the possibility of
closure. <br>
TIMMIN: Yes, sir. <br>
MORGUS: That is all, Krau. <br>
TIMMIN: There has been a message from General Chellak, sir. <br>
MORGUS: Yes? <br>
TIMMIN: The General wishes to inform you that his men have captured two
gun runners and intercepted an arms delivery to the android rebels. <br>
MORGUS: Ah, taken two runners alive? Get me Chellak on vision. <br>
TIMMIN: Yes, sir. <br>

Now men, if we double round, we can cut them off here. <br>
KRELPER: How many? <br>
STOTZ: Ten, maybe a dozen. Come on, let's fumigate some squaddies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CHELLAK: The survey team were charting Blue level,
weren't they? Did anyone see anything? <br>
SALATEEN: Apparently not, sir. They heard Trooper Boze cry out and ran
back, but it was like the others. The thing hadn't left much of him. <br>
CHELLAK: That's five men now. Always on Blue level. If we had the time
and the manpower, I'd send a squad down there to find it and destroy
it. <br>
SALATEEN: Nice trophy for the mess, sir. <br>
(Knock at the door.) <br>
CHELLAK: Yes. <br>
(The door opens, and the Doctor and Peri are pushed inside.) <br>
TROOPER: Stand there. <br>
DOCTOR: Couldn't we have a chair? It's been a rather strenuous day. <br>
CHELLAK: You will stand there until I've finished with you, and when
you address me, you will call me sir. <br>
DOCTOR: May I ask who you are, sir? <br>
CHELLAK: I am General Chellak, Commander of all Federal forces on this
planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Well done, sir. I suppose you started in the ranks. <br>
CHELLAK: Under emergency regulations, anyone caught supplying arms to
the android rebels faces summary execution. <br>
PERI: But, but, we weren't supplying arms. We were, well, we just found
them. <br>
DOCTOR: Sir. <br>
PERI: Sir. <br>
CHELLAK: If you cooperate, I'm prepared to extend clemency. If you
don't cooperate, you'll be shot. Is that clear? <br>
DOCTOR: Couldn't put it more plainly. Exactly how do we cooperate? <br>
PERI: Sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
CHELLAK: Do not provoke me. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. <br>
CHELLAK: I want to know your names and the names of your confederates.
I want full details of all armaments deliveries, where and how they are
brought in, who supplies them back on Major, and what your
communication arrangements are with Sharaz Jek. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I am generally known as the Doctor. My young friend here
is known as Peri, that is, Perpegillium Brown. <br>
CHELLAK: Don't waste my time. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, if we could just sit down and talk about this little
misunderstanding in a civilised manner. My young friend here has been
complaining of pains in her legs. You can see for yourself she's
suffering from some sort of urticaria. <br>
CHELLAK: Silence. <br>
DOCTOR: Come to that, I don't feel too well myself. <br>
(The communications panel beeps.) <br>
CHELLAK: Yes? <br>
TROOPER {OC]: Signals, sir. Trau Morgus is on Vid. He wants to speak to
you immediately, General. <br>

be completed by the morning. <br>
MAN: Yes, Trau. <br>
(The tall blond man steps into an external lift and the door slides
down. Trau Morgus turns on the holographic vid-screen.) <br>
MORGUS: The gun runners. What information have you obtained? <br>
CHELLAK [on screen]: Nothing as yet, only their names, sir. <br>
MORGUS: What are their names? <br>
CHELLAK [on screen]: One calls himself the Doctor, the girl's name is
Peri. <br>
MORGUS: A girl? Bring them to the screen. <br>
CHELLAK [on screen]: I've only just begun the interrogation. I hope to
get enough out of these two to be able to round up the rest of the
gang. <br>
MORGUS: I hope so too, General, for your sake. Your operation so far
has been a dismal failure. <br>
CHELLAK [on screen]: With respect, sir, I don't believe you fully
understand the difficulty of the conditions here. <br>
MORGUS: All I understand is you're supposed to be trained soldiers, and
yet one renegade and a handful of mindless androids has been dancing
rings round you for six months. <br>
CHELLAK [on screen]: I might remind you we captured the Spectrox
refinery in our first assault. <br>
MORGUS: And allowed Sharaz Jek to spirit away the entire stockpile from
under our noses. I warn you, General. People here are in no mood to
tolerate your blundering much longer. </font></p>

CHELLAK [OC]: I will not accept criticism from a civilian, no matter
how rich and powerful he is. The captives are here. <br>

merely wish to inspect you, to see the kind of creatures capable of
betraying the golden vision of our glorious pioneers. Already I feel
contaminated. Get rid of them. <br>
(The Doctor and Peri leave the screen and Chellak returns.) <br>
MORGUS: You have done well, General. I apologise if my earlier remarks
seemed intemperate. It's just the frustration I feel here when I long
to stand shoulder to shoulder with you. All right minded people feel
the same. And so to boost morale, I will arrange for the execution. <br>
CHELLAK [on screen]: But I've already told them their lives will be
spared if they collaborate. <br>
MORGUS: No collaboration, General. No deals with traitors. The public
will not stand for it. <br>
CHELLAK [on screen]: If they're shot out of hand, we lose the chance of
valuable information. <br>
MORGUS: That may be true, but it is not of prime importance. These
people are the lowest type of human being. One only has to look at them
to realise the extent of their depravity. Get rid of them, General. <br>

command Federal forces here? <br>

the Praesidium in his pocket. <br>
DOCTOR: We're quite innocent, you know. This is all a mistake. <br>
CHELLAK: Yes, I think I'm beginning to believe you, Doctor, but in
times of war the innocent die too. <br>
PERI: Is that all you can say? We're about to be killed <br>

CHELLAK: I'll take them out. These two, detention cells, and get them
ready for execution. <br>
(Chellak leaves.) <br>
SALATEEN: You have heard of death under the red cloth? <br>
DOCTOR: Afraid not. <br>
SALATEEN: It is a military procedure. After death, your bodies are
taken to the Field Cremation Unit. Your ashes are wrapped in the red
cloth of execution and will be disposed of according to your
directions. <br>

PRESIDENT: My apothecary recommends point three of a centilitre per
day. I've been without for three weeks now and have begun to feel my
age. <br>
MORGUS: It is a wonderful restorative. <br>
PRESIDENT: The greatest boon ever bestowed on humanity, offering us at
least twice normal lifespan. Would you think I was eighty four? <br>
MORGUS: Fifty, at the most. <br>
PRESIDENT: Quite. That is why this war must be brought to a conclusion
soon, Morgus, one way or another. <br>
MORGUS: There is only one honourable way, sir. Sharaz Jek must be
crushed. <br>
PRESIDENT: Of course. But our forces are making such poor progress and
meanwhile people here are clamouring for supplies of Spectrox to be
resumed. It's understandable. <br>
MORGUS: That is the razor's edge Jek is holding to our throats, but we
cannot accede to criminal blackmail. <br>
PRESIDENT: My dear Morgus, I agree entirely, but we are forced to see
the matter from different viewpoints. <br>
MORGUS: Patriotism is the only viewpoint. <br>
PRESIDENT: A businessman's patriotism may differ from that of a
politician. I am forced to take account of the mood of the people, and
it is becoming ugly. Whereas you need only take account of a balance
sheet, which since the market value of Spectrox has risen so
astronomically, must look much healthier now than it did at the start
of this conflict. <br>
MORGUS: My Conglomerate is contributing handsomely towards the cost of
operation on Androzani Minor. <br>
PRESIDENT: Yes, the Praesidium is duly grateful, but as your
Conglomerate owns that planet, it is perhaps no more than might be
expected. <br>
MORGUS: Trau President, am I to understand the Praesidium is
considering ending the war, offering Sharaz Jek an armistice? <br>
PRESIDENT: Not immediately. However, if the military stalemate

MORGUS: They were merely ignorant handlers, Excellency. The stews of
the city are full of such unemployed riff-raff. <br>
PRESIDENT: Most of them unemployed, Trau Morgus, because you have
closed so many plants. It's caused great unrest. <br>
MORGUS: Easily settled. Those without valid employment cards will be
shipped off to the eastern labour camps. <br>
PRESIDENT: Yes, we might make that seem morally justifiable. I'll put
your interesting suggestions to the Praesidium tomorrow. <br>
MORGUS: Naturally, should any special funding be required? <br>
PRESIDENT: Most generous. Of course, the irony is while you've been
closing plants here in the west, you've been building them in the east.

DOCTOR: Oh, marvellous sense of humour. Try not to get hysterical. What
do you mean, we're dying? <br>

second stage. First a rash, then spasms, finally slow paralysis of the
thoracic spinal nerve and then TDP. <br>
PERI: TDP? <br>
SALATEEN: Thermal death point. It's called Spectrox toxaemia. I've seen
dozens die from it. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the cure? <br>
SALATEEN: Oh, there's no cure. Wait till Jek finds out. <br>
PERI: He's kidding, isn't he? No, I guess not. <br>
SALATEEN: I'm sorry. I don't suppose you see the funny side of it. <br>
DOCTOR: What is a Spectrox nest? <br>
SALATEEN: Deposits left by the bat colonies. Raw Spectrox contains a
chemical similar to mustard nitrogen. It's deadly to humans, so they
use the androids to collect the stuff and take it to the refinery. <br>
DOCTOR: We haven't seen any bats. <br>
SALATEEN: The androids probably destroyed most of them. They spend a
chrysalid stage in the nest. Three year life cycle. <br>
PERI: There has to be an antidote to this Spectrox toxaemia. I mean, if
it's a snake venom effect, there has to be a serum or antitoxin. <br>
SALATEEN: There is. It was discovered years ago by Professor Jackij. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don't keep us in suspense. <br>
SALATEEN: You need the milk from a queen bat. Trouble is, they've all
gone down to the deeps to die, so you can't reach them. <br>
PERI: Why not? <br>
SALATEEN: Well, for a start, there's no oxygen down there. <br>
DOCTOR: What else? You said, for a start. <br>
SALATEEN: There's some kind of creature down there. Probably lives in
the magma and comes up to the surface to hunt. It's a carnivore. <br>
PERI: What's it like, this creature? <br>

SALATEEN: I'll explain later, General. One escaped prisoner, sir. <br>
CHELLAK: The android? <br>
SALATEEN: She's real enough. Android's legs don't blister. Sharaz Jek
smuggled in copies of this girl and her friend, the Doctor, and I'm
afraid, sir, that he also copied me. <br>
CHELLAK: Copied you? <br>
SALATEEN: I've been held prisoner at his camp for months now, sir, and
what you thought was me is in fact an android, a spy for Sharaz Jek. <br>
CHELLAK: You mean I've had an android as my ADC without knowing it? <br>

JEK: The Magma creatures never ascend above Blue level, and they have,
in any case, no taste for my androids, only flesh and blood. <br>

CHELLAK: Using the android. <br>
SALATEEN: So long as Jek doesn't discover I've made it back here, he'll
believe everything the android relays him to the terminal. <br>
CHELLAK: You're a wily fellow, Salateen, I've always said so. But how
will that help? <br>
SALATEEN: We can make him think we're moving in one direction when in
fact we'll be moving in on his base. I know the way to it. <br>

JEK: Tell them if they will supply gas weapons as agreed, and deliver
them safely, I will pay eight kilos for the next shipment. <br>

DOCTOR: I wish I knew. <br>
JEK: Take him. <br>
(Two androids take hold of the Doctor's arms, and stretch them out.) <br>
JEK: Tear his arms out slowly. You know the power an android can exert,
Doctor. After your arms, they will remove your legs. Now, where's the
girl? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. We got into a shoot-out with one of your androids
and then she disappeared. <br>
JEK: You can't protect her. I shall tear the truth out of you. <br>
DOCTOR: I think she's with Salateen. <br>
JEK: Salateen? In that case they've probably reached the army camp.
Release him. <br>
DOCTOR: If they have, it's round two to the army, I'd say. <br>

STOTZ: Jek, what about him. <br>
JEK: He's no further use to me now. <br>
STOTZ: I'd like to take him back to Major. I think the boss might want
to question him. <br>

give him a set of bogus coordinates. <br>
CHELLAK: Yes, then we circle around and catch the beggar napping.
That's very good, Salateen. <br>
SALATEEN: Well, I think Jek will automatically believe anything he
hears you discussing with Morgus. He has a tap on the interplanetary
vid. He can pick up all the transmissions between here and Major. <br>
CHELLAK: How long has he been intercepting our vid transmissions? <br>
SALATEEN: I think the android put the tap in, sir. <br>

advanced warning of every operation we've planned. <br>

ADRIC: You know that, Doctor. <br>
NYSSA: You mustn't die, Doctor. <br>
ADRIC: You know that, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Adric? <br>
NYSSA: You mustn't die, Doctor. <br>
MASTER: No, my dear Doctor, you must die! Die, Doctor! Die, Doctor.
Bwahahahahahaha! <br>
(As the images of his companions and his laughing enemy circle his
mind, the Doctor's features change. Back comes the curly hair. Suddenly
a slightly older man sits up and looks at his hands.) <br>
PERI: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: You're expecting someone else? <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048346/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Colin
Baker</a>, channelling William Hartnell in spades.) <br>
PERI: I, I, I. <br>
DOCTOR: That's three I's in one breath. Makes you sound a rather
egotistical young lady. <br>
PERI: What's happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Change, my dear. And it seems not a moment too soon. </font>
