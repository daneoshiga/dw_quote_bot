appears to be a spacesuit is staggering through a difficult terrain. He
pauses for breath and is shot in the side by an arrow, then collapses
and tumbles down a slope into a small pool.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is twirling a large, colourful beach
umbrella, and singing.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I do like to be beside the seaside, I do like to be beside
the sea. <br>
(Sarah is in shorts and halter top, and assembling items for a day on
the beach.) <br>
SARAH: Sunglasses, sun lotion, water wings. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you won't need those for a start. <br>
SARAH: Oh, we're going swimming, you said. <br>
DOCTOR: You can't sink on Florana. <br>
SARAH: I can sink anywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: The water's effervescent. The bubbles support you. <br>
SARAH: Like swimming in a glass of health salts. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, but you wait until you've seen Florana. I always
come back from Florana feeling a hundred years younger. <br>
(A red light is flashing on the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, the air is like a magic potion. <br>
SARAH: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: And the beauty of it all is <br>
SARAH: Doctor, should that red light be flashing? <br>
DOCTOR: We seem to have got a mains power <br>
(Flash bang! Sarah screams. The lights go out.) <br>
SARAH: What is it, Doctor? What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not sure. I'll cut in the emergency units. <br>
(Everything comes back on.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's a relief. If they hadn't worked, we'd have been in
real trouble. <br>
(The lights fade out again.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, it's starting again. <br>
(The Tardis crashes and throws the Doctor and Sarah to the floor before
landing unsteadily on that same planet. The lights continue to
fluctuate as they get to their feet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. Well, one thing's certain. We've landed. <br>
(The sound mutates into a sort of slow electronic wail.) <br>
SARAH: It's as if the Tardis was dying. <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah, the scanner, quickly. There could be enough charge to
operate it. <br>
(The scanner shows swirling mists before fading out.) <br>
SARAH: Did you see anything, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Only fog. Fascinating, isn't it? <br>
SARAH: What's fascinating about fog? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps that's what's put the Tardis out of action. <br>
(The lights go out and the Tardis goes quiet.) <br>
SARAH: Oh. Don't we have emergency storage cells or something? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. <br>
(But they only light things up for a couple of seconds.) <br>
SARAH: Dud battery? <br>
DOCTOR: Hardly. Listen. <br>
SARAH: I can't hear anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Not a click, not a tick. Nothing. The Tardis is a
living thing, thousands of instruments. Its energy sources never stop. <br>
SARAH: Well they have now. Everything's completely dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah, there's a torch in that cabinet. Get it for me, will
you? <br>
(Sarah fishes around in a wooden box.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, right. Ah, here we are. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
(The torch works.) <br>
SARAH: Ah. <br>
(And then fades out.) <br>
SARAH: Oh. Now what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don't worry. I've got an oil lamp in here. That should be
all right. Yes, there it is. <br>
SARAH: Ah, don't tell me. You're going to rub it and produce a genie. <br>
DOCTOR: On the contrary, I'm going to light it and illumine us. <br>
SARAH: Ah! <br>
DOCTOR: There we are. <br>
SARAH: Oh, hooray for old-fashioned oil. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we'll have to get it adjusted. That's better. Right now,
let's see where we are. <br>
SARAH: Florana, you said. <br>
DOCTOR: Here, hold this for a minute, will you? Normally this door is
power operated. We'll have to work it by hand. Where's that crank
handle? There it is. <br>
SARAH: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Now bring the light over here, please. <br>
(The Doctor inserts the crank into a hole by the doors and turns it.
They open slowly.) <br>
DOCTOR: A bit more. Is that enough? <br>
SARAH: I think so. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, right, that's enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Now follow me. Let's take a look. <br>
DOCTOR: All right? <br>
SARAH: Yes.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Exxilon]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They step out into an area with strange shaped
rocks.) <br>
SARAH: Oh! It's cold! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this is no ordinary fog. <br>
SARAH: You mean this isn't the air that's like a magic potion? <br>
DOCTOR: It must be perfectly obvious to you, Sarah, that we've gone
ever so slightly astray, so sarcasm of that <br>
SARAH: Argh! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, it's all right. It's just rock. <br>
SARAH: A statue? <br>
DOCTOR: No, some sort of life form that has become petrified, I should
think. <br>
SARAH: I was close to becoming petrified myself. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I doubt if anything has grown here for centuries. <br>
SARAH: Well, unless you're planning on raising lettuce, it doesn't seem
too important. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if the rest of the planet's like this, then life here
certainly doesn't depend on photosynthesis. <br>
SARAH: What life? <br>
DOCTOR: Some power emanating from this planet has stopped the Tardis's
energy banks. Now logically, that power can hardly be of geological
origin. <br>
SARAH: You mean somebody or something has caused it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. <br>
SARAH: Right. Well, let's fix the Tardis and clear out. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, I'm afraid we can't fix it. Not unless we discover
the source of the power that's blocking us. <br>
SARAH: Oh. Well, how are we going to do that? <br>
DOCTOR: I've no idea. <br>
(Something is moving by a rock nearby.) <br>
SARAH: You mean that we're? We're trapped? Stuck here for ever? <br>
DOCTOR: Until we can discover the source of that energy loss, yes. <br>
SARAH: Well, what do you want me to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think to begin with, we must check the immediate area,
don't you? <br>
SARAH: Yes, right. Oh. Not really dressed for this climate, am I? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, girl, go and put something warm on. <br>
SARAH: Yes, right. You won't go away, will you? <br>
(Sarah goes back into the darkened Tardis and puts on a long sleeved
Dress. The Doctor starts exploring the strange rock figures. He is
followed by two life forms. Further along, he stops to examine the
mineral content of the soil and gets jumped by a life form. Sarah pulls
on a pair of boots and leaves the Tardis.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor? Doctor? <br>
(She moves off, searching, and is followed by a life form.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? <br>
(Sarah runs, and finds the oil lamp still flickering. She picks it up.
There is something wet and sticky on it.) <br>
SARAH: Blood. <br>
(Sarah throws away the lamp and runs back to the Tardis.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (One of the life forms is already inside when
Sarah enters.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor? <br>
(There are footsteps outside. Sarah looks out and sees two life forms
approaching. She goes inside and cranks the doors shut. When she has
finished, the life form inside comes up behind her. It touches her, she
turns and lashes out at it with the crank handle. It falls to the
floor, she cranks the door open as it crawls towards her. It grabs her
leg, she hits it again and runs out into the night past two of its
fellows.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Exxilon]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has had his hands tied and is being
led by a rope. He falls. The life form behind comes to help him up and
he knocks it down, then attacks the leader, grabbing its axe and using
its edge to cut his bonds. There is more fighting until the two life
forms lie still, and he runs off. <br>
Sarah is evading her pursuers. She comes across a pulsing light and
walks towards it. It is a beacon on the top of a large white city. <br>
Later, day is breaking, and the Doctor is still walking through rocks
and gullies. Now we see clearly that the local life forms wear large
pieces of fabric that conceal their shape and are the same colour as
the rocks. One of them is following the Doctor when he spots something
partly concealed in the soil. It is a rope or wire pulled taut. The
Doctor picks up a stone, backs away and throws it at the rope. A large
rock balanced at the top of the crevasse tumbles down followed by a man
in a space suit, wielding a knife. He attacks the Doctor. They
struggle, then a second man appears, and shouts as he runs down.) <br>
RAILTON: Galloway! Galloway! You fool. He's not one of them. Sorry,
we've been a bit jumpy. We tend to attack first, ask questions after. <br>
GALLOWAY: (Scots) There's something moving. <br>
RAILTON: Let's get back to our base. We can talk there. <br>
(A life form watches them go.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside MSC base]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A nervous guard with a bow and arrow is outside a
metallic triangle entrance. He hides when he hears someone
approaching.) <br>
RAILTON: It's all right, Peter. He's quite friendly. <br>
GALLOWAY: We hope. <br>
RAILTON: Keep a sharp watch, Peter. Dan heard some movement out there. <br>
HAMILTON: Aye aye, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[MSC base]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (An injured man lies on a bed with a woman looking
after him.) <br>
JILL: Did you find Jack? <br>
RAILTON: I'm afraid not. How is he? <br>
JILL: He's not good, and we're down to our last pack of sulphagen
tablets, Richard. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened to him? <br>
JILL: The Exxilons took us by surprise, right after we landed. <br>
GALLOWAY: These stone knives of theirs have got some sort of poison on
them. They're dirty wee fighters. <br>
RAILTON: I'm sorry, perhaps we ought to introduce ourselves. I'm
Captain Railton, second in command of the expedition, and this is
Commander Stewart. <br>
(The man on the bed.) <br>
RAILTON: And that's Jill Tarrant, our civilian geologist. <br>
JILL: Are you from Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: In a roundabout sort of way, yes. <br>
GALLOWAY: Dan Galloway. <br>
RAILTON: Lieutenant Galloway is our weapons officer. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it would have saved me a few bruises if we'd shaken hands
the first time we'd met. Hello, how do you do? <br>
RAILTON: The chap outside is Lieutenant Peter Hamilton. <br>
DOCTOR: Lieutenant? Are you a military expedition? <br>
RAILTON: MSC. <br>
DOCTOR: Master of Science? <br>
RAILTON: Marine Space Corps. <br>
GALLOWAY: Now maybe you'll tell us about yourself. Where were you
heading when I jumped you? <br>
DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis. That's my spaceship. I have a young
companion with me, Sarah Jane Smith. I only hope she had the good sense
to stay inside after I was captured. <br>
RAILTON: Where is the ship? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not far from here. <br>
GALLOWAY: Oh, if the lassie stayed in your ship, she should be safe
enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, if. Sarah's rather headstrong. By now, I expect she's out
looking for me. <br>
RAILTON: Well, even if she is, it needn't be too dangerous as long as
she's careful. The Exxilons seem to be night creatures. <br>
JILL: We don't see much of them during the day. Just so long as she
didn't go near that forbidden city of theirs. <br>
DOCTOR: What forbidden city? <br>
RAILTON: Only their high priests can visit it. <br>
GALLOWAY: Anyone else they catch near it. <br>
(Galloway mimes throat-cutting.) <br>
GALLOWAY: That's their lot. <br>
JILL: They're sacrificed. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what is this place? Where is it? <br>
RAILTON: Pass me the visual file, will you, Jill? We've got some
pictures. Thank you. <br>
(The pictures are of the city that Sarah saw during the night.) <br>
RAILTON: It's a fantastic building. Must have been constructed
thousands of years ago. <br>
JILL: And not by a stone age tribe like the Exxilons, either. <br>
RAILTON: They treat it as a sort of shrine. If you're caught near it,
it's certain death.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[City wall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The walls are of smooth, carved stone. There is a
frieze of a C with a dot between its arms which rotates by 90 degrees
in batches of four. Sarah approaches and touches one long uncarved
stone, which flashes briefly. She tries again with both hands then
moves on to the frieze, which also flashes upon her touch.) <br>
SARAH: No doors, no windows. <br>
(An Exxilon comes up behind her and envelopes her in its 'cloak'.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[MSC base]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mealtime.) <br>
RAILTON: Then as soon as we got within range of Exxilon, we had total
malfunction on all instruments. We managed to touch down without
damaging the ship, but we can't take off again until we find some way
of restoring power. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, what's the purpose of your expedition? <br>
JILL: Well, to collect parrinium. <br>
DOCTOR: Parrinium? <br>
JILL: It's a chemical. It can be found in minute quantities on Earth,
but it's so rare there that it's virtually priceless. A chemical
detecting satellite did a fly past on this planet and registered that
it was as common here as salt. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, forgive me, but what do you want it for? <br>
GALLOWAY: Och, man. Where have you been hiding? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, here and there, one place and another. Well, I am a
little out of touch, I'll admit. <br>
JILL: Well, the outer worlds are being ravaged by a disease. The
colonists are dying in their thousands. Another ten million men, women
and children will die unless we help them, and help them quickly. Every
hour we're stuck here on this planet, the death toll's mounting. <br>
DOCTOR: And parrinium will halt this disease? <br>
RAILTON: Well, it can cure and give immunity, but they need it in
quantity and they need it fast. <br>
JILL: If it's not delivered within a month, it'll be too late. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. <br>
RAILTON: We managed to get a message off before we had total power
failure, to Earth. We asked them for a relief ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you happen to know if that message was received? <br>
GALLOWAY: Oh, if it had been I think we'd have had help by now. <br>
DOCTOR: I think we can safely assume that no help is coming. So, might
I make a suggestion <br>
(Hamilton bursts in.) <br>
HAMILTON: The relief ship is here! Come on, quickly! <br>
(Hamilton runs out.) <br>
RAILTON: The relief ship? <br>
GALLOWAY: The relief ship's here.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside MSC base]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RAILTON: Did you see it? <br>
HAMILTON: No, I heard it, up in the haze. Over to the north a little
bit. <br>
GALLOWAY: It's probably making a spiral descent. We should hear it
again in a moment. <br>
JILL: Here she comes! <br>
(A Mysteron style flying saucer whizzes across the sky.) <br>
RAILTON: They're landing in the next valley. Come on! <br>
(The Doctor and the four humans run off. Two Exxilons come out of
hiding and enter the base, where the barely conscious Captain Stewart
sees them.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In a large stone cavern, a raised fire pit
illumines a crowd of Exxilons and a wooden cage. The leader is in a
slightly different shade of brown to the others. Their faces can now be
seen. They look like bare skulls with massive blank eyes.) <br>
PRIEST: You have looked upon the sacred place. You have walked where
only the chosen may go. You have defiled the place of all power. <br>
(Sarah is in the cage, tied up with her hands over her head. Two
Exxilons enter the cage and unfasten Sarah then lead her out.) <br>
PRIEST: A judgment has been made. Prepare her for sacrifice! <br>
(Sarah starts to struggle.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JILL: It's over there! <br>
HAMILTON: That doesn't look like an Earth ship, sir. <br>
GALLOWAY: Well, maybe it's that new Z-47 they've been planning. <br>
RAILTON: She's not a Space Corps craft. <br>
GALLOWAY: Well, I hope they haven't run into the same power block. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll know soon enough. <br>
(A hatch in the skirt of the saucer opens.) <br>
HAMILTON: Come on out! The welcome party's all here! <br>
(Out glide a party of oversized pepper pots.) <br>
DOCTOR: Daleks! <br>
DALEK: The Earth creatures are to be exterminated. Fire at my command. <br>
RAILTON: Wait a minute! Wait! You can't! <br>
DALEK: Total extermination. Fire, fire, fire! <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (But the Dalek weapons do not put out any energy.)
<br>
DALEK: Maximum power. Fire! Fire! Fire! <br>
(Still no deadly beams of energy.) <br>
DALEK: Weaponry malfunction. <br>
DALEK 2: Total power failure in armament circuits. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, well, well. Daleks without the power to kill. How does it
feel? <br>
DALEK: Keep away. Keep away! <br>
DOCTOR: And if I don't, what will you do? Your weapons are totally
useless, affected by the same energy blackout that has stranded us. <br>
DALEK 2: The power failure is temporary. Superior Dalek technology will
overcome interference shortly. Meanwhile, you will obey our orders. <br>
DOCTOR: You're not in a position to give any orders. No, no, we're all
in this together. All equal, all powerless. <br>
DALEK: The Daleks are the supreme beings of the universe. Dalek
technology is the <br>
RAILTON: Spare us the propaganda. I think our best interest will be
served by joining forces. <br>
DALEK: Daleks do not require the co-operation of inferior creatures. <br>
RAILTON: Think about it. There are four of you and five of us, and this
planet is swarming with creatures that want to destroy us. That's a
fact that must penetrate even Dalek arrogance. <br>
DALEK: We will confer. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they may agree with your plan, Captain, but I advise you,
don't trust them. <br>
RAILTON: We need all the help we can get. <br>
JILL: That's true. <br>
GALLOWAY: We don't need the Daleks. There's nothing they can do that we
can't do on our own, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: They're brilliant technicians. It was their inventive genius
that made them one of the greatest powers in the universe, remember
that. <br>
RAILTON: Quite. They might find a way out of this spot. <br>
HAMILTON: My father was killed in the last Dalek war, sir. I hate the
thought of working with them. <br>
RAILTON: He was one man. Ten million will die if we don't get off the
planet with the medical supplies. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, whatever they're going to do, I hope they decide quickly.
<br>
(Meanwhile, in the cavern Sarah is in front of the fire pit. The
Exxilons are chanting.) <br>
HAMILTON: What do you think, Dan? <br>
GALLOWAY: Mmm? <br>
HAMILTON: About this idea. Cooperating with Daleks. <br>
GALLOWAY: Well, it might work for the while. <br>
HAMILTON: I think the Captain's gone soft. <br>
GALLOWAY: Oh, he's scared of the wee salt-shakers. I saw his face when
they came out of that ship. <br>
HAMILTON: Ah, the spokesman's coming back. <br>
RAILTON: Well, what did they say? <br>
DOCTOR: I think they'll go for it. Mind you, they haven't much choice,
but I must warn you again. Don't you trust them an inch. <br>
JILL: Did you manage to find out what they're doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Several of the planets the Daleks have colonised are
suffering from the same disease. They're dying in millions. Now they
need that chemical just as badly as you do. That's why I think they'll
cooperate. <br>
(A little way away, the Daleks are talking.) <br>
DALEK 2: It is agreed. <br>
DALEK 3: We will cooperate until they are no further use to us. <br>
DALEK: And the true reason that we need the chemical parrinium must
remain secret. <br>
DALEK 3: It is understood. <br>
DALEK: They must continue to believe there are only four of us. <br>
DALEK 2: It is understood. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, have you decided? <br>
DALEK: Yes, Doctor. The truce exists between our party and yours. <br>
DOCTOR: A very wise decision. <br>
DALEK: The truce ends when power is restored. <br>
RAILTON: We agree. And now I think we should all go over to the mining
dome. <br>
DALEK: Mining dome? <br>
JILL: We've located a parrinium strata, and set up a dome nearby where
we can refine the ore. <br>
RAILTON: But it's pretty slow work without power. Perhaps you can
suggest some quicker technique? <br>
DALEK: Very well. Lead the way. Lead! Lead! </font></p>

Stewart is missing. Railton leads the five people and three Daleks. In
a dried river bed, the Doctor spots soil tumbling down the steep sides.
Everyone stops and looks around. Railton gets shot in the back by an
arrow.) <br>
DOCTOR: Take cover! <br>
DALEK: Locate the enemy! Locate the enemy! Locate! Locate! Locate!
Locate! Locate! <br>
(Jill runs to Railton, but he is dead. Exxilons appear on the skyline
above them.) <br>

JILL: But please, we can't leave him here. <br>

DOCTOR: Quick, come on. Out, come on. <br>

DOCTOR: Come on, down here. Which way did they come from? <br>
GALLOWAY: I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: Down! <br>
(They hide behind the thick sand dune.) <br>
DOCTOR: Our only chance is that it's a small group, then we might make
a break for it. <br>
GALLOWAY: Well, I'm next in seniority to the Captain. That puts me in
command. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a suggestion, that's all. <br>
JILL: All right, Commander, give an order to get us out of this. <br>
(Another group of Exxilons have appeared.) <br>
HAMILTON: Over there! <br>
(But an arrow thuds into the dune by the Doctor's head. There are more
behind them, too.) <br>
DOCTOR: So it was a large group. <br>
(Galloway shoots an Exxilon. The group flatten themselves at the bottom
of the dug out as arrows and spears come at them from all angles.) <br>

DALEK: Am losing control! Am losing control! Am loosing, am loosing, am
losing control! Am losing control! <br>
(Smoke pours out of the Dalek case. Everyone backs away and it goes
Bang! then catches fire. The humans risk taking a look as the Exxilons
dance around the bonfire. A procession approaches and the Exxilons run
over to meet it.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's going on over there? <br>
JILL: They've got Commander Stewart. <br>
STEWART: Give yourselves up. <br>
HAMILTON: That settles it for me. Jill? <br>
JILL: Yes. <br>
HAMILTON: What about you, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly, when the only alternative to living is dying. All
right. Come on, let's get it over with. <br>

Galloway puts down his bow and follows.)

SARAH: Mmm. Er, they made me inhale some sort of incense. Well, what
happened? <br>
JILL: Well, I'm not too sure myself, but neither of you is very
popular. The Doctor attacked their High Priest. From what we can
gather, that's about the worst crime you can commit on this planet. <br>

ever had a making a deal with these savages. <br>

that girl would've been dead. <br>
GALLOWAY: (sotto) So? <br>
HAMILTON: (sotto) Look, we're all in this together. It could have been
me or you. Do you expect everybody else to stand by and let it happen? <br>
GALLOWAY: (sotto) The point is it wasn't us. We have no loyalties to
them. They're not part of our mission. <br>
HAMILTON: (sotto) So you'll let them die, just like that? <br>
GALLOWAY: (sotto) I would so. Our job is to get medical relief that'll
save the lives of millions. If some people we don't even know have to
die in the process, well, that's just too bad. <br>
DALEK: We have decided the action we will take. We will offer the
Exxilons our knowledge and technology in return for their assistance. <br>
GALLOWAY: Well, anything's worth a try. <br>
HAMILTON: (sotto) What about those two? Do you think they'll agree to
let them go? <br>

unimportant. Guard! I will speak with the High Priest. <br>

yourself too closely with us. I think we're the flies in a jar of very
nasty ointment. <br>

been postponed. I think they'll be two of us in the next performance. <br>

persecuted and driven to live in the secret places beneath the surface.

away from the Dalek? What did you see down there? <br>
DOCTOR: All right. All right, all right, all right, all right. Just a
moment, just a moment! I've just had a face to face confrontation with
a rather nasty root. It obviously wasn't very fond of me but it
positively hated the Dalek. <br>

systems for the city, I should imagine. <br>
SARAH: Well, what happened to the Dalek? <br>

planets. Our ancestors solved the mysteries of science, built craft
that travelled through space. They were the supreme beings of the
universe. <br>
DOCTOR: What destroyed their power, war? <br>
BELLAL: No. They created their own destruction. Using all their
knowledge, they built a city that would last through all of time. <br>
SARAH: And they succeeded. It looked as though it was built only
yesterday. <br>
BELLAL: They used their sciences to make the city into a living thing.
It could protect itself, repair itself, maintain itself. They even gave
it a brain. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. So the city became an entity, though greater and more
powerful than the many small parts that had created it. <br>
BELLAL: Yes, it then had no need of those who had made it. Our people
had created a monster. They tried to destroy it. Instead it destroyed
them and drove out the survivors. Now we, and the other Exxilons you
met, are all that remain. <br>
SARAH: What separates you from the others? <br>
BELLAL: They have made the city their god. They worship and fear it.
They even make sacrifices to it. <br>
SARAH: Yes, we almost qualified for that ourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: Yet you don't fear the city, Bellal. Why? <br>
BELLAL: Yes, we do fear it, but we don't worship it. Our aim is to
destroy it. Unless we succeed, our race will vanish from this planet. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HAMILTON: Galloway, for God's sake, use the bomb! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, get out of here quick or we'll be caught in the
exhaust blast! Come on, out! Come on, quick. Move! <br>
(The party takes cover, and come out again when the ship has taken
off.) <br>
SARAH: Well, it's not much consolation, but at least they don't have
the parrinium. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
SARAH: Of course. Well, the Daleks have only got bags of sand. Jill and
I loaded to real parrinium aboard the Earth ship.&nbsp;<br>
HAMILTON: I should never have trusted Galloway. He had one of the Dalek
bombs. Could have stopped them with it, damaged their ship. If I knew
where he was </font></p>

DALEK: Prepare to launch plague missile. <br>
DALEK 2: I obey. <br>
(Galloway is hiding behind the sacks of sand. He sets the bomb ticking
then presses the red button. The spaceship goes KaBOOM!) </font></p>

JILL: He must have hidden away when we put the bags on board. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he did his duty, now you must do yours. Get that
parrinium to where it's needed. <br>
SARAH: Doctor, look! Look at the city! <br>
(The now powerless City is giving in to the ravages of time and rapidly
decaying into a pile of rubble.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's rather a pity, in a way. Now the universe is down to six
hundred and ninety nine wonders. </font> </p>
