Bang! inside. It flies over the Millennium Dome with the Doctor
dangling from the threshold, sonic screwdriver between his teeth and
trying to pull himself back inside. They are heading straight for the
Parliament Clock Tower, so the Doctor sonics the controls and changes
course just in time. He climbs back inside and shuts the doors behind
him, exhausted, as the Tardis careers on its way.)

garden of an old house. A little
red-haired Scottish girl is saying her prayers.) <br>
AMELIA: Dear Santa. Thank you for the dolls and pencils and the fish.
It's Easter now, so I hope I didn't wake you, but honest, it is an
emergency. There's a crack in my wall. Aunt Sharon says it's just an
ordinary crack, but I know it's not, because at night there's voices,
so please, please, could you send someone to fix it? Or a policeman. Or
a <br>
(She hears the Tardis materialising outside, then a crash.) <br>
AMELIA: Back in a moment. <br>
(She grabs a torch and looks outside. The Tardis has crash-landed on
its side, on the garden shed.) <br>
AMELIA: Thank you, Santa. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Garden]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(For only the second time ever, the Tardis doors
open outwards - they are facing the sky - and a grappling hook is
thrown out. A soaking wet Doctor clambers out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Could I have an apple? All I can think about. Apples. I love
apples. Maybe I'm having a craving? That's new. Never had cravings
before. <br>
(He sits on the edge of the Tardis and looks inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa. Look at that. <br>
AMELIA: Are you okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Just had a fall. All the way down there, right to the library.
Hell of a climb back up. <br>
AMELIA: You're soaking wet. <br>
DOCTOR: I was in the swimming pool. <br>
AMELIA: You said you were in the library. <br>
DOCTOR: So was the swimming pool. <br>
AMELIA: Are you a policeman? <br>
DOCTOR: Why? Did you call a policeman? <br>
AMELIA: Did you come about the crack in my wall? <br>
What crack? Argh! <br>
(He falls to the ground.) <br>
AMELIA: Are you all right, mister? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm fine. It's okay. This is all perfectly norm <br>
(A breath of golden energy comes from his mouth.) <br>
AMELIA: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know yet. I'm still cooking. Does it scare you? <br>
AMELIA: No, it just looks a bit weird. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. The crack in your wall. Does it scare you? <br>
AMELIA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, no time to lose. I'm the Doctor. Do everything I
tell you, don't ask stupid questions, and don't wander off. <br>
(The Doctor walks straight into a tree.) <br>
AMELIA: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Early days. Steering's a bit off. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMELIA: If you're a doctor, why does your box say
Police? <br>
(The Doctor bites into an apple, then spits it out.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's disgusting. What is that? <br>
AMELIA: An apple. <br>
DOCTOR: Apple's rubbish. I hate apples. <br>
AMELIA: You said you loved them. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I like yoghurt. Yoghurt's my favourite. Give me
yoghurt. <br>
(Amelia gets him a pot from the fridge. He pours it in his mouth and
then spits it out.) <br>
DOCTOR: I hate yoghurt. It's just stuff with bits in. <br>
AMELIA: You said it was your favourite. <br>
DOCTOR: New mouth. New rules. It's like eating after cleaning your
teeth. Everything tastes wrong. Argh! <br>
(The Doctor twitches violently.) <br>
AMELIA: What is it? What's wrong with you? <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong with me? It's not my fault. Why can't you give me any
decent food? You're Scottish. Fry something. <br>
(So Amelia gets the frying pay out while the Doctor dries his hair with
a towel.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, bacon! <br>
(That gets spat out, too.) <br>
DOCTOR: Bacon. That's bacon. Are you trying to poison me? <br>
(A saucepan of baked beans gets heated up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, you see? Beans. <br>
(Until he gets them in his mouth, that is.) <br>
DOCTOR: Beans are evil. Bad, bad beans. Bread and butter. Now you're
talking. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Front door]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor throws the plate of bread and butter
out, hitting a cat.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMELIA: We've got some carrots. <br>
DOCTOR: Carrots? Are you insane? No. Wait. Hang on. I know what I need.
I need, I need, I need fish fingers and custard. <br>
(The Doctor contentedly dips the fish fingers into a bowl of custard
and eats, while Amelia has ice cream.&nbsp;<br>
AMELIA: Funny. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I? Good. Funny's good. What's your name? <br>
AMELIA: Amelia Pond. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's a brilliant name. Amelia Pond. Like a name in a
fairy tale. Are we in Scotland, Amelia? <br>
AMELIA: No. We had to move to England. It's rubbish. <br>
DOCTOR: So what about your mum and dad, then? Are they upstairs?
Thought we'd have woken them by now. <br>
AMELIA: I don't have a mum and dad. Just an aunt. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't even have an aunt. <br>
AMELIA: You're lucky. <br>
DOCTOR: I know. So, your aunt, where is she? <br>
AMELIA: She's out. <br>
DOCTOR: And she left you all alone? <br>
AMELIA: I'm not scared. <br>
DOCTOR: Course, you're not. You're not scared of anything. Box falls
out of the sky, man falls out of a box, man eats fish custard, and look
at you, just sitting there. So you know what I think? <br>
AMELIA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Must be a hell of a scary crack in your wall. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bedroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The crack is about three to four feet long, and
slightly w shaped.) <br>
DOCTOR: You've had some cowboys in here. Not actual cowboys, though
that can happen. <br>
AMELIA: I used to hate apples, so my mum put faces on them. <br>
(Amelia gives the Doctor an apple with a smiley face cut into it.) <br>
DOCTOR: She sounds good, your mum. I'll keep it for later. This wall is
solid and the crack doesn't go all the way through it. So here's a
thing. Where's the draught coming from? <br>
(He scans it with the sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. You know what the crack is? <br>
AMELIA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a crack. But I'll tell you something funny. If you knocked
this wall down, the crack would stay put, because the crack isn't in
the wall. <br>
AMELIA: Where is it then? <br>
DOCTOR: Everywhere. In everything. It's a split in the skin of the
world. Two parts of space and time that should never have touched,
pressed together right here in the wall of your bedroom. Sometimes, can
you hear? <br>
AMELIA: A voice. Yes. <br>
(There is a vague growling from somewhere. The Doctor empties Amelia's
nighttime glass of water and uses it to listen to the crack.) <br>
ATRAXI [OC]: Prisoner Zero has escaped. <br>
DOCTOR: Prisoner Zero? <br>
AMELIA: Prisoner Zero has escaped. That's what I heard. What does it
mean? <br>
ATRAXI [OC]: Prisoner Zero has escaped. <br>
DOCTOR: It means that on the other side of this wall, there's a prison
and they've lost a prisoner. And you know what that means? <br>
AMELIA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You need a better wall. The only way to close the breach is to
open it all the way. The forces will invert and it'll snap itself shut.
Or <br>
AMELIA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine
and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? <br>
AMELIA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Everything's going to be fine. <br>
(The Doctor takes little Amelia's hand and aims the sonic screwdriver
at the crack. It widens, flooding the bedroom with bright light.) <br>
ATRAXI [OC]: Prisoner Zero has escaped. Prisoner Zero has escaped. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello? Hello? <br>
(A giant blue eye looks at them through the crack.) <br>
AMELIA: What's that? <br>
(A bolt of light goes to the Doctor, and he doubles over, then the
crack closes again.) <br>
DOCTOR: There, you see? Told you it would close. Good as new. <br>
AMELIA: What's that thing? Was that Prisoner Zero? <br>
DOCTOR: No. I think that was Prisoner Zero's guard. Whatever it was, it
sent me a message. Psychic paper. Takes a lovely little message.
(reads) Prisoner Zero has escaped. But why tell us? Unless. <br>
AMELIA: Unless what? <br>
DOCTOR: Unless Prisoner Zero escaped through here. But he couldn't
have. We'd know. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The stairs go up. There is a door across the way
and two at the far end where the staircase goes down again.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's difficult. Brand new me. Nothing works yet. But there's
something I'm missing. In the corner of my eye. <br>
(The Tardis Cloister Bell tolls.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Garden]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: I've got to get back in there. The engines
are phasing. It's going to burn! <br>
AMELIA: But it's just a box. How can a box have engines? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not a box. It's a time machine. <br>
AMELIA: What, a real one? You've got a real time machine? <br>
DOCTOR: Not for much longer if I can't get her stabilised. Five minute
hop into the future should do it. <br>
AMELIA: Can I come? <br>
DOCTOR: Not safe in here. Not yet. Five minutes. Give me five minutes,
I'll be right back. <br>
AMELIA: People always say that. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I people? Do I even look like people? Trust me. I'm the
Doctor. <br>
(He jumps down into the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Geronimo! <br>
(Splash! The door close and the Tardis dematerialises. Amelia runs back
to her room, gets a suitcase from underneath her bed and packs. The
door across from hers is the bathroom. She doesn't notice that one of
the doors at the end is now open. Dressed in duffel coat and wooly hat,
Amelia sits on her suitcase in the garden and waits. <br>
(When the Tardis finally materialises, steaming, it is day and Amelia
is not there. The Doctor stumbles out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Amelia! Amelia, I worked out what it was. I know what I was
missing! You've got to get out of there! </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Amelia? Amelia, are you all right? Are you
there? <br>
(He runs up to her bedroom door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Prisoner Zero's here. Prisoner Zero is here! Prisoner Zero is
here! Do you understand me? Prisoner Zero is <br>

cricket bat.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(At the Royal Leadworth Hospital, a lady doctor and
a male nurse march into the ward.) <br>
RAMSDEN: So. They all called out at once, that's what you're saying?
All of them. All the coma patients. You do understand that these people
are all comatose, don't you? They can't speak. <br>
RORY: Yes, Doctor Ramsden. <br>
RAMSDEN: Then why are you wasting my time? <br>
RORY: Because they called for you. <br>
RAMSDEN: Me. <br>
BARNEY [OC]: Doctor. <br>

see a young lady in a micro-skirted police uniform using her radio.) <br>
AMY: White male, mid twenties, breaking and entering. Send me some
back-up. I've got him restrained. Oi! You, sit still. <br>
DOCTOR: Cricket bat. I'm getting cricket bat. <br>
AMY: You were breaking and entering. <br>
(The Doctor is handcuffed to the radiator.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's much better. Brand new me. Whack on the head, just
what I needed. <br>
AMY: Do you want to shut up now? I've got back up on the way. <br>
DOCTOR: Hang on, no, wait. You're a policewoman. <br>
AMY: And you're breaking and entering. You see how this works? <br>
DOCTOR: But what are you doing here? Where's Amelia? <br>
AMY: Amelia Pond? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, Amelia. Little Scottish girl. Where is she? I promised
her five minutes but the engines were phasing. I suppose I must have
gone a bit far. Has something happened to her? <br>
AMY: Amelia Pond hasn't lived here in a long time. <br>
DOCTOR: How long? <br>
AMY: Six months. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No. No. No, I can't be six months late. I said five
minutes. I promised. What happened to her? What happened to Amelia
Pond? <br>
AMY: (into radio) Sarge, it's me again. Hurry it up. This guy knows
something about Amelia Pond. </font></p>

RORY: Doctor Ramsden, there is another sort of er, funny thing. <br>
RAMSDEN: Yes, I know. Doctor Carver told me about your conversation.
We've been very patient with you, Rory. You're a good enough nurse, but
for God's sake. <br>
RORY: I've seen them. <br>
RAMSDEN: These patients are under twenty four hour supervision. We know
if their blood pressure changes. There is no possibility that you could
have seen them wandering about the village. Why are you giving me your
phone? <br>
RORY: It's a camera too. <br>
(Doctor Ramsden's bleeper goes off.) <br>
RAMSDEN: You need to take some time off, Rory. A lot of time off. Start
now. Now. </font></p>

house right now. <br>

DOCTOR: But you're the police. <br>
AMY: Yes, and this is where I live. Have you got a problem with that? <br>
DOCTOR: How many rooms? <br>
AMY: I'm sorry, what? <br>
DOCTOR: On this floor. How many rooms on this floor? Count them for me
now. <br>
AMY: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because it will change your life. <br>
AMY: Five. One, two, three, four, five. <br>
DOCTOR: Six. <br>
AMY: Six? <br>
DOCTOR: Look. <br>
AMY: Look where? <br>
Exactly where you don't want to look. Where you never want to look. The
corner of your eye. Look behind you. <br>
AMY: That's, that is not possible. How's that possible? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a perception filter all round the door. Sensed it the
last time I was here. Should've seen it. <br>
AMY: But that's a whole room. That's a whole room I've never even
noticed. <br>
DOCTOR: The filter stops you noticing. Something came a while ago to
hide. It's still hiding, and you need to uncuff me now. <br>
AMY: I don't have the key. I lost it. <br>
DOCTOR: How can you have lost it? Stay away from that door! Do not
touch that door! Listen to me, do not open that. Why does no-one ever
listen to me? Do I just have a face that nobody listens to? <br>

AMY: Will that door hold it? <br>
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. It's an interdimensional multiform from
outer space. They're all terrified of wood. <br>

AMY: What's that? What's it doing? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Getting dressed? Run. Just go. Your back up's

down to reveal a workman in overalls and toolbelt, with a black

AMY: What? I'm sorry, but what? <br>
DOCTOR: It's all one creature. One creature disguised as two. Clever
old multi-form. A bit of a rush job, though. Got the voice a bit
muddled, did you? Mind you, where did you get the pattern from? You'd
need a psychic link, a live feed. How did you fix that? <br>
(The coma patient has a photograph of a black dog by his bed, just to
confirm
the identification. The man in the corridor opens his mouth to reveal
the long needle-like teeth.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stay, boy! Her and me, we're safe. Want to know why? She sent
for back up. <br>
AMY: I didn't send for back-up! <br>
DOCTOR: I know. That was a clever lie to save our lives. Okay, yeah, no
back up. And that's why we're safe. Alone, we're not a threat to you.
If we had back up, you'd have to kill us. <br>
ATRAXI [OC]: Attention, Prisoner Zero. The human residence is

AMY: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that would be back up. Okay, one more time. We do have
back up and that's definitely why we're safe. <br>

raggedy. Time to put on a show. <br>
RORY: You just summoned aliens back to Earth. Actual aliens, deadly
aliens, aliens of death, and now you're taking your clothes off. Amy,
he's taking his clothes off. <br>
DOCTOR: Turn your back if it embarrasses you. <br>
RORY: Are you stealing clothes now? Those clothes belong to people, you
know. (to Amy) Are you not going to turn your back? <br>
AMY: No. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Roof]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor walks out in a new shirt with several
ties draped around his neck. The Atraxi is hovering overhead.) <br>
AMY: So this was a good idea, was it? They were leaving. <br>
DOCTOR: Leaving is good. Never coming back is better. Come on, then!
The Doctor will see you now. <br>
(The eyeball drops onto the roof and scans the Doctor.) <br>
ATRAXI: You are not of this world. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but I've put a lot of work into it. <br>
(He looks at his selection of ties.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, hmm, I don't know. What do you think? <br>
ATRAXI: Is this world important? <br>
DOCTOR: Important? What's that mean, important? Six billion people live
here. Is that important? Here's a better question. Is this world a
threat to the Atraxi? Well, come on. You're monitoring the whole
planet. Is this world a threat? <br>
(There is a projection of the world between them.) <br>
ATRAXI: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Are the peoples of this world guilty of any crime by the laws
of the Atraxi? <br>
ATRAXI: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. One more. Just one. Is this world protected? Because
you're not the first lot to come here. Oh, there have been so many. <br>
(The projection shows the Daleks et al.) <br>
DOCTOR: And what you've got to ask is, what happened to them? <br>
(A run through of all the previous Doctors, then this Doctor steps
through the projection with a jacket and bow tie.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. Basically, run. <br>
(The eyeball zooms back to its ship and leaves, very fast. There is a
brief materialisation sound, then the Doctor takes a glowing Tardis key
out of his new jacket pocket.) <br>
AMY: Is that it? Is that them gone for good? Who were they? <br>
(The Doctor is already down the stairs and running out of the
hospital.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis is waiting for him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, what have you got for me this time? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Look at you. Oh, you sexy thing! Look at
you. <br>
(Amy and Rory run up just at it dematerialises. <br>
Night time. The sound of the Tardis wakes Amy up. She runs outside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry about running off earlier. Brand new Tardis. Bit
exciting. Just had a quick hop to the moon and back to run her in.
She's ready for the big stuff now. <br>
AMY: It's you. You came back. <br>
DOCTOR: Course I came back. I always come back. Something wrong with
that? <br>
AMY: And you kept the clothes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I just saved the world. The whole planet, for about the
millionth time, no charge. Yeah, shoot me. I kept the clothes. <br>
AMY: Including the bow tie. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's cool. Bow ties are cool. <br>
AMY: Are you from another planet? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
AMY: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: So what do you think? <br>
AMY: Of what? <br>
DOCTOR: Other planets. Want to check some out? <br>
AMY: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It means. Well, it means come with me. <br>
AMY: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Wherever you like. <br>
AMY: All that stuff that happened. The hospital, the spaceships,
Prisoner Zero. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, that's just the beginning. There's loads more.
<br>
AMY: Yeah, but those things, those amazing things, all that stuff. That
was two years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh.! Oops. <br>
AMY: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: So that's <br>
AMY: Fourteen years! <br>
DOCTOR: Fourteen years since fish custard. Amy Pond, the girl who
waited, you've waited long enough. <br>
AMY: When I was a kid, you said there was a swimming pool and a
library, and the swimming pool was in the library. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Not sure where it's got to now. It'll turn up. So,
coming? <br>
AMY: No. <br>
DOCTOR: You wanted to come fourteen years ago. <br>
AMY: I grew up. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I'll soon fix that. <br>
(He opens the Tardis door and follows Amy in.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Well? Anything you want to say? Any passing
remarks? I've heard them all. <br>
AMY: I'm in my nightie. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry. Plenty of clothes in the wardrobe. And
possibly a swimming pool. So, all of time and space, everything that
ever happened or ever will Where do you want to start? <br>
AMY: You are so sure that I'm coming. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I am. <br>
AMY: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Cause you're the Scottish girl in the English village, and I
know how that feels. <br>
AMY: Oh, do you? <br>
DOCTOR: All these years living here, most of your life, and you've
still got that accent. Yeah, you're coming. <br>
AMY: Can you get me back for tomorrow morning? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a time machine. I can get you back five minutes ago. Why,
what's tomorrow? <br>
AMY: Nothing. Nothing. Just you know, stuff. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, then. Back in time for stuff. <br>
(A sonic screwdriver rises from a slot in the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! A new one! Lovely. Thanks, dear. <br>
(The Doctor uses an old typewriter wired into the console.) <br>
AMY: Why me? <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
AMY: No, seriously. You are asking me to run away with you in the
middle of the night. It's a fair question. Why me? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Fun. Do I have to have a reason? <br>
AMY: People always have a reason. <br>
DOCTOR: Do I look like people? <br>
AMY; Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Been knocking around on my own for a while. My choice, but I've
started talking to myself all the time. It's giving me earache. <br>
AMY: You're lonely. That's it? Just that? <br>
DOCTOR: Just that. Promise. <br>
AMY: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: So, are you okay, then? Because this place, sometimes it can
make people feel a bit, you know. <br>
AMY: I'm fine. It's just, there's a whole world in here, just like you
said. It's all true. I thought. Well, I started to think that maybe you
were just like a madman with a box. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy Pond, there's something you'd better understand about me,
because it's important, and one day your life may depend on it. I am
definitely a madman with a box. Ha ha! Yeah. Goodbye Leadworth, hello
everything. <br>
(He sets the Tardis in flight. We watch it dematerialise in the garden,
then we go back to Amy's bedroom with the wedding dress and its veil
hanging up on the back of the door.) </font> </p>
