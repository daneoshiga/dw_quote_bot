<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Well, I suggest before we go outside and
explore, let us clean ourselves up. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Now what does the radiation read, Susan? <br>
SUSAN: It's reading normal, Grandfather. <br>
(But after they walk away, the needle goes up into the Danger Zone) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BARBARA: There's been a forest fire. Everything's
sort of white and ashen. <br>
IAN: Funny mist. <br>
DOCTOR: The heat must have been indescribable. Look at this soil here.
Look at it. It's all turn to sand and ashes. Extraordinary. How can
shrubs or trees grow in soil like that, hmm? <br>
IAN: Something else that's strange. There's quite a breeze blowing. <br>
SUSAN: Well? <br>
IAN: Well, look at the branches and things. <br>
SUSAN: They don't seem to be moving. <br>
BARBARA: They're not. They're absolutely still. <br>
(Ian touches a twig, and it breaks easily) <br>
IAN: Huh. Like stone, look. Very brittle stone. It crumbles when you
touch it. Look. <br>
DOCTOR: It's petrified. How fascinating, a petrified jungle. Hm.
Extraordinary. Yes, I must really investigate that. Couldn't have been
heat, then, and age would merely decay. <br>
SUSAN: What could have caused it, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, I don't know, but I intend to find out. <br>
SUSAN: Well I'm coming too. <br>
(The Doctor and Susan go exploring) <br>
BARBARA: Ian, where are we? <br>
IAN: I don't know. <br>
BARBARA: Well why doesn't he take us back? <br>
IAN: I'm not sure that he can. <br>
BARBARA: What, ever? <br>
IAN: I hate it as much as you. I'm just as afraid. But what can we do? <br>
BARBARA: Well, we could at least stay near the ship. <br>
IAN: The ship's no good without him. We'd better keep an eye on him. He
seems to have a knack of getting himself into trouble. <br>
BARBARA: You think there's any danger? <br>
IAN: Not necessarily. <br>
BARBARA: But don't be too complacent. No, you're right, I suppose. I
just wish <br>
IAN: We'll be all right. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. Well, I suppose we'd better make sure he doesn't fall
down and break a leg. Don't you ever think he deserves something to
happen to him? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
(Further on, Susan has made a discovery) <br>
SUSAN: Oh Grandfather, look! It's a flower. A perfect flower. Well,
it's even kept some of it's colour. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, very pretty, very pretty. Hm. <br>
SUSAN: Hey, look. Look what I've found. <br>
IAN: Oh, that's beautiful. <br>
SUSAN: Isn't it? I'm going to try and pick it and keep it all in one
piece. <br>
IAN: Oh, be careful. It'll be very fragile. There we are. <br>
SUSAN: Beautiful. When I get it back to the ship I'm <br>
BARBARA: Ian! <br>
SUSAN: going to put it into a glass and <br>
BARBARA: Ian! <br>
IAN: Coming, coming. <br>
(And he puts the flower in Susan's hands, and it breaks) <br>
IAN: What is it? What's the matter? <br>
(Barbara points at a lizard) <br>
BARBARA: No! <br>
IAN: It's all right. Like everything else in this place, solid stone. <br>
BARBARA: It's hideous. <br>
IAN: Yes, it is. It's also significant. Nothing on Earth could look
like this. <br>
BARBARA: It looks like some sculptor's nightmare. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's certainly alien to anything on your planet. But
you're wrong about one thing, Chesterfield. This isn't like everything
else. The animal is solidified, certainly, but it's not crumbly stone.
It's metal. Yes, it always was. <br>
IAN: What, even when it was alive? But that's impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? Can't you imagine an animal unless it's flesh, blood and
bone, hmm? No, I tell you this is an entirely different formation. I
should say originally it was some pliable metal held together by a
magnetic field, or an inner magnetic field, rather, and it may have had
the ability to attract it's victims towards it, if they were metal too.
<br>
BARBARA: We're not on Earth, then. <br>
DOCTOR: No, certainly not. <br>
IAN: Are you sure? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, certain. And you needn't look at me like that, young man.
We started this journey far too hurriedly to make any calculations. You
know that as well as I do. However, we're alive. <br>
SUSAN: Hey, Grandfather, look. The jungle ends over there. <br>
IAN: Try not to be too upset. <br>
BARBARA: I counted so much on just going back to things I recognise and
trust. But here there's nothing to rely on. Nothing. <br>
IAN: Well, there's me. Barbara, all I ask you to do is believe, really
believe, we'll go back. We will, you know. <br>
BARBARA: I wish I was more like you. I'm afraid I'm a very unwilling
adventurer. <br>
IAN: I'm not exactly reveling in it myself. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather's talking about fixing our position by the stars. <br>
IAN: Good. Where is he? <br>
SUSAN: Just over there. <br>
BARBARA: Susan. Don't you have anything in the ship that records the
journeys? <br>
SUSAN: Oh, yes. There's a meter fixed to a great big bank of computers.
If you feed it with the right sort of information, it can take over the
controls of the ship and deliver you to any place you want to go. <br>
BARBARA: Then why don't we know where we are? <br>
SUSAN: Well, it's a question of the right information, you see. I don't
say that Grandfather doesn't know how to work the ship, but he's so
forgetful, and then he will go off and. Well, he likes to work on his
own. <br>
BARBARA: So I've noticed. <br>
SUSAN: Anyway, he's only got to do some computations back in the ship
and we can move on. <br>
BARBARA: Well, it can't be too soon for me. <br>
DOCTOR: Well now, are we ready? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, Doctor, have you worked out yet how all this happened? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not really, not really. Whatever it was destroyed
everything that was living, but the planet is dead, totally dead. <br>
IAN: Barbara, Doctor. Over here. <br>
DOCTOR: What is it, Chesterton? We really must get back to <br>
(From the edge of the petrified jungle they can see across a plain to a
city) <br>
DOCTOR: Most fascinating. <br>
BARBARA: A city, a huge city. <br>
(The Doctor puts on a pair of binocular glasses) <br>
IAN: Well, Doctor? Can you see anything? Any sign of life? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no sign of life. No, just buildings. Magnificent
buildings, I <br>
SUSAN: Oh, let me have a look. It's fabulous. Here, you have a look. <br>
(Barbara takes her turn) <br>
IAN: What do you think, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, I don't know. Whatever it was destroyed the
vegetation here certainly hasn't damaged the city. But there's no sign
of life. No movement, no light, no. No, I shall know more about it when
I've been down there. <br>
BARBARA: Down there? Oh, no. We're going back to the ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, don't be ridiculous. That city down there is a magnificent
subject for study, and I don't intend to leave here until I've
thoroughly investigated it. <br>
IAN: Well it's too late to talk about it now. It's getting dark. We'll
discuss it when we get back to the ship. <br>
SUSAN: Yes. Whatever you decide, it's too late to get down there now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, all right then. But I assure you I'm determined
to study that place. <br>
IAN: You can do what you like, as long as you don't endanger the rest
of us. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well then. I shall look at it myself, alone. <br>
IAN: You're the only one who can operate the ship. I'm afraid I can't
let you do that, Doctor. Your glasses. <br>
(Walking back through the jungle) <br>
IAN: I think this is the way we came. <br>
(Susan stops to pick another flower, then gets frightened) <br>
SUSAN: Who's there? <br>
(Someone or something touches her shoulder. She screams and Ian goes
back to find her) <br>
IAN: All right, Susan, it's all right. You're safe now. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BARBARA: Did Susan tell you what frightened her? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. She's convinced that someone touched her, and I tried
to make her see it wasn't possible but I'm afraid she wouldn't listen
to me. I wonder, would you have a talk with her? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, of course I will. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you know, sometimes I find the gulf between Susan's age
and mine makes difficult understanding between us. <br>
BARBARA: I'll see what I can do. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, would you? Thank you, thank you very much. I'd be grateful.
<br>
(Susan is sitting at a table) <br>
BARBARA: Hello. <br>
SUSAN: Hello. <br>
BARBARA: What are you doing? <br>
SUSAN: Just drawing. <br>
BARBARA: Well, can I see? <br>
SUSAN: It's the flower I saw in the jungle. <br>
BARBARA: What happened out there? <br>
SUSAN: Nothing. <br>
BARBARA: Well Ian said you were terrified. Well, something must have
frightened you. <br>
SUSAN: It's not that so much. It's just that I'm, I'm fed up no one
believes me. <br>
BARBARA: Believes what? <br>
SUSAN: Oh, I don't know. <br>
BARBARA: That there was someone out there and they touched you on the
shoulder? <br>
SUSAN: There was someone there. <br>
BARBARA: But you didn't see who it was? <br>
SUSAN: No. It was like that. A light touch on the shoulder. I couldn't
have been mistaken. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I believe you. <br>
SUSAN: But Grandfather says that it's impossible for anyone to live out
there. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, Susan, it isn't that he doesn't believe you. It's just
that he finds it difficult to go against his scientific facts. <br>
SUSAN: I know. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, look. Why don't you just try and forget it for the moment?
<br>
SUSAN: For the moment. <br>
(By a bank of computers in the wall, the Doctor is noting the readings
on the screens and dials) <br>
IAN: What's this one for? I don't know how you make sense of any of
this. <br>
DOCTOR: You're quite right, quite right. <br>
IAN: Can you find where we are? Well, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh. <br>
IAN: I was wondering if perhaps you <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, these eternal questions of yours. Do I know where
we are, I suppose? <br>
IAN: Now listen, Doctor, I don't want to argue with you. We're fellow
travellers whether we like it or not. But for heaven's sake try and see
it from our point of view. You've uprooted us violently from our own
lives. You <br>
DOCTOR: You pushed your way into the ship, young man. <br>
IAN: All right, all right, I admit it. A small part of the blame is
ours. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, small? <br>
IAN: But naturally we're anxious. What are we going to do? Can we live
here? What do we eat? There are millions of questions. <br>
DOCTOR: A very good idea. I'm hungry. <br>
(Susan it putting drops into a glass of water. Barbara is holding her
head) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, what's the matter? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, I've suddenly got this terrible headache. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dear, dear, how irksome for you. Oh, this stuff is very
good. This should cure it. Now, not too much, dear, not too much. <br>
SUSAN: No. Oh, Grandfather. I'm sorry I was so silly just now. Here,
try this. <br>
BARBARA: Thank you. Oh, it's very nice. <br>
IAN: Let's hope it does you some good. <br>
(The Doctor is nibbling at something from a machine nearby) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, did you want something to eat? What would you like? <br>
BARBARA: I'd like some bacon and eggs. <br>
IAN: All right, bacon and eggs. <br>
DOCTOR: Bacon and eggs. <br>
IAN: But <br>
SUSAN: This is fully automatic. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, certainly, certainly. J62. <br>
SUSAN: (turning dials) J62. <br>
DOCTOR: L6. <br>
SUSAN: L6. <br>
IAN: I hope mine doesn't taste of engine grease. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, now, don't be ridiculous. <br>
BARBARA: Shall I get plates and things? <br>
SUSAN: No, there's no need to. <br>
(The Doctor takes two blocks out of the dispensing slot) <br>
SUSAN: Eggs and bacon. <br>
DOCTOR: Bacon and eggs. <br>
IAN: What, this? <br>
SUSAN: Go on, try it. <br>
(They unwrap the blocks and take a small bite) <br>
DOCTOR: Well? <br>
IAN: Mm. Not bad. What do you think, Barbara? <br>
BARBARA: I think it's delicious. <br>
IAN: My bacon's a bit salty. <br>
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be. It's English. <br>
IAN: No, seriously, Doctor, this is remarkable. I mean, one bite and I
taste the bacon, another and I taste the egg. How do you do it? <br>
DOCTOR: Food has component parts, dear boy. Flavours are rather like
primary colours, you know, you blend two to achieve a third, a fourth,
etc, etc. <br>
IAN: Well, I think it's wonderful. <br>
SUSAN: How's your headache now? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, it's much better. I don't usually get them at all. <br>
DOCTOR: Susan, would you like something to eat? <br>
SUSAN: No thanks, I'm not hungry. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, child, that's unusual. I do hope your affects outside the
ship hasn't affected you too much. <br>
SUSAN: No. I think I'll go to bed now, anyway. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
SUSAN: Do you want to know where you can sleep, Miss Wright? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, yes. <br>
(They hear a tapping sound) <br>
IAN: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: The scanner. <br>
SUSAN: There was somebody there. <br>
(But the scanner just shows the trees) <br>
IAN: Nothing. Not a thing. <br>
SUSAN: But something must have made that noise. <br>
BARBARA: Look, I've had enough of this. Please, can't we get out of
here? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, but the city. I must see the city. <br>
BARBARA: But why? <br>
DOCTOR: I will not be questioned. Uninvited passengers. I didn't invite
them to the ship. I shall do what I want to do. <br>
IAN: Why endanger the rest of us by staying here? <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, please. Please. <br>
(So the Doctor sets the Tardis going, and ducks under the console to
remove something) <br>
BARBARA: Stone trees are all very well, but the next forest I walk
through I want them all to be made of wood. <br>
(The Tardis starts shaking) <br>
SUSAN: What's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. The power take-up was rising normally and <br>
IAN: What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh don't distract me, please. <br>
SUSAN: Shall I trace it on the fault locator, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you'd better, child. <br>
SUSAN: (checking a printout) K7. <br>
DOCTOR: K7? Ah, yes, of course, the fluid link. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. <br>
(Goes under the console and comes up with the part he took off earlier)
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, there we are, you see. The end of it's unscrewed itself
and the fluid has run out. <br>
IAN: Have you got a spare? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no need for that. This is easily repaired. All we have
to do is refill it. <br>
IAN: What liquid do you need? <br>
DOCTOR: Mercury. <br>
IAN: Mercury. Can I get it for you? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid you can't. We haven't any at all. <br>
IAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
IAN: Don't you carry a supply? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it hasn't been necessary. This hasn't happened before. <br>
IAN: But you must have some somewhere, surely. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. We shall have to get some from outside. <br>
BARBARA: But where? There isn't anything outside because <br>
IAN: Yes. There's the city. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the city, of course. Of course we're bound to get some
mercury there. Yes, we're bound to. Well, I mean, what else can we do,
hmm? <br>
IAN: It seems we have no alternative. We have to go to the city. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. At first light, then? <br>
(Next day) <br>
IAN: Well, it's light enough and there doesn't seem to be anything out
there. We might as well get started. Oh, and Doctor. Remember we're
going to this city to find mercury, and once we've found it we're
coming straight back here. Is that clear? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, quite so, quite so. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: Well, shall I lead? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, by all means. <br>
IAN: Look. <br>
(There's a small curved metal object on the ground) <br>
BARBARA: Don't touch it, it might go off. <br>
SUSAN: Be careful. <br>
DOCTOR: What is it, Chesterton? <br>
IAN: I don't know. Stand back, all of you. <br>
(He prods it with a long stick, then taps it. It sounds hollow) <br>
IAN: I think it's all right. A metal box. It's a box of glass phials.
Look. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me see. <br>
SUSAN: Then there was somebody here last night. They must have dropped
them. I knew I was right. <br>
IAN: Yes. Sorry, Susan. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'd like to run a few tests on those. Susan, would you
take these into the ship, please? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Oh, and by the way, did you remember the food
supplies? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. A day's supply for four. That's enough, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, ample, ample. <br>
IAN: I trust we won't be more than a couple of hours. You ready, Susan?
<br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>
IAN: Come on, then. Off we go. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[City]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A very metallic, angular place) <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mind if I sit down for a minute? I feel a bit exhausted.
<br>
IAN: You all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm just a bit tired. It was a long journey and my legs
are rather weak. <br>
BARBARA: Why don't you rest here? Ian and I will look around and see if
we can <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, I want to look around too. I shall be all
right, thank you. <br>
IAN: I must say, I don't feel too good myself. Look, why don't we get
this over with quickly. Look for instruments, gauges, anything like
that. Ideally what we want is a laboratory. <br>
(A door opens) <br>
BARBARA: Ian, look. <br>
IAN: Why don't we separate and go different ways and meet back here in
say, ten minutes. All right? <br>
BARBARA: Fine. I'll go this way. (through the door) <br>
DOCTOR: Would you lend me your arm, would you, Susan? Thank you. <br>
(Ian finds the sensor to open another door - it's the round things by
the side of them) <br>
(On her travels, Barbara has to duck in the odd-shaped corridor, and
she is watched by a remote camera) <br>
SUSAN: Let's try this one. (the door opens for her) There's no light. <br>
(Barbara gets shut in by bulkheads closing behind her, but she only
notices when she tries to retrace her steps) <br>
IAN: Ah, there you are. Any luck? <br>
SUSAN: No. How about you? <br>
IAN: No, no luck. Barbara should be here by now. Barbara! Barbara!
We'll give her a couple of minutes more, and then if she's not back
we'll have to go and look for her. <br>
(Barbara is finally trapped and disappears) <br>
IAN: We've waited long enough for her. We must go and find her. <br>
(In another level of the city, Barbara leaves the elevator, and is
confronted by a vicious looking sink-plunger being waved by something.
She screams) </font></p>

same door as Barbara did earlier) <br>
IAN: Barbara? Barbara? Barbara? <br>

SUSAN: Miss Wright? <br>
(Ian tries another) <br>
IAN: Barbara? <br>
SUSAN: Hey, there's a corridor over here. <br>
IAN: We might as well see where it goes to. Come on. <br>
DOCTOR: Wait. <br>
IAN: What's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. <br>
SUSAN: I can hear a ticking noise. <br>
DOCTOR: Quiet, child. Now listen. <br>
IAN: Yes. Over here somewhere. <br>
DOCTOR: It's stopped now. <br>
SUSAN: Hey, there it is again. <br>
IAN: It's coming from in here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN Ah, this is more hopeful. We ought to find
some mercury here. <br>
DOCTOR: Measuring equipment. But measuring what? Look here. Look at
this drum. The ink's still quite wet. <br>
IAN: Yes. Hard to imagine what sort of people these are. <br>
DOCTOR: They're intelligent, anyway. Very intelligent. <br>
IAN: Yes, but how do they use their intelligence? What form does it
take? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, as if that matters. What these instruments tell us is that
we're in the midst of a very, very advanced civilised society. <br>
SUSAN: Here it is. The thing that's ticking. It's over here. It's a
Geiger counter. <br>
IAN: But look at the needle! It's past the danger point. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that explains a lot of things, doesn't it. A jungle
turned to stone, the barren soil and the fact that we're not feeling
well. <br>
IAN: Radiation sickness? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid so. The atmosphere here is polluted with a very
high level of fallout, and we've been walking around in it completely
unprotected. <br>
IAN: What? But how do you explain the buildings? They're intact. <br>
DOCTOR: A neutron bomb. Yes. It destroys all human tissue, but leaves
the buildings and machinery intact. Yes. <br>
IAN: What? But how much radiation, and how badly? <br>
DOCTOR: We need, we need drugs to be treated. <br>
IAN: But where are we going to find them? <br>
SUSAN: The Tardis will have to take us to another time and place where
we can be cured. <br>
IAN: But don't you remember? We can't move the ship until we find the
mercury for the fluid link! <br>
DOCTOR: For the fluid link, yes. Yes, I'm afraid I cheated a little on
that. I was determined to see the city, but everybody wanted to go on
and, well, to avoid arguments, in short, there's nothing wrong with the
fluid link. <br>
SUSAN: What? Grandfather, do you mean to say that you risked leaving
the ship just to see this place? <br>
IAN: You fool. You old fool! <br>
DOCTOR: Abuse me as much as you like, Chesterton. The point is we need
an immediate return to the ship, and I suggest we leave at once. <br>
IAN: We're not leaving until we've found Barbara. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well. You may stay and search for her if you wish, but
Susan and I are going back to the ship. Now, come along, child. <br>
IAN: All right, carry on, fine. How far do you think you'll get without
this? (the fluid link) <br>
DOCTOR: Give that to me. <br>
IAN: Not until we've found Barbara. <br>
DOCTOR: Give it to me, I say. <br>
IAN: No! It's time you faced up to your responsibilities. You got us
here. Now I'm going to make sure that you get us back. <br>
DOCTOR: Chesterton, this is <br>
IAN: We're wasting time. We should be looking for Barbara. <br>
SUSAN: He's right, Grandfather. We are wasting time. <br>
DOCTOR: Child, if only you'd think as an adult sometimes. Oh, very
well. Let's go then. Let's go. </font></p>

were moving you about. Any little thing may help us. <br>
BARBARA: No, nothing much. They moved me from floor to floor, always in

any furniture now I come to think about it. <br>

BARBARA: I tried to think of how I could get away from them, but then I

must have drugged me in some way. <br>
IAN: It's not that. Barbara, we've got radiation sickness. All of us.
The Doctor's pretty badly hit. <br>
BARBARA: Well, how do you know it's radiation? <br>
SUSAN: We found a Geiger counter. It seems that all the time we've been

that's why. <br>
DALEK 2: No, that is not true. We know the Thals have existed outside
our city. <br>
DALEK 1: The truth is your supply of drugs has failed, and you came
into the city to see if you could find more. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. Thals? What are you talking about? We're not Thals, or

Why not let one of us go and bring the phials here? And under guard, if
necessary. <br>

held responsible for his return. <br>
DOCTOR: He will have our lives in his hands. That is enough. <br>
DALEK 1: Then we agree. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me something about the people, the Thals. <br>
DALEK 1: Over five hundred years ago there were two races on this
planet. We, the Daleks, and the Thals. After the neutronic war, our
Dalek forefathers retired into the city, protected my our machines. <br>
DOCTOR: And the Thals? <br>
DALEK 1: Most of them perished in the war, but we know that there are
survivors. They must be disgustingly mutated, but the fact that they
have survived tells us they must have a drug that preserves the life
force. <br>
DOCTOR: And knowing that these mutated creatures exist outside the

going to starve unless they can find new supplies of food. You see,
after the war, the Thals that survived managed to cultivate small plots
of land. Well, that's how they've survived ever since. But they've
always had to be very, very careful, because the crops have always been
in danger. But, you see, they rely on a great rainfall that only
happens about every four or five years. Well, it's two years overdue

BARBARA: Are there any Daleks? <br>
IAN: Wait there. No, no, I think we're all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, lets get back to the ship. <br>
SUSAN: No, no, I must warn the Thals. <br>
DOCTOR: Susan. <br>
SUSAN: We can't let them walk into a trap. <br>
DOCTOR: The Thals are no concern of ours. We cannot jeopardise our
lives getting involved in an affair which is none of our business. <br>
BARBARA: Of course it's our business. The Thals gave us the
anti-radiation drug. Without that, we'd be dead! <br>
IAN: Yes, but the Doctor's got a point. There's no sense in risking our
whole party. You go back to the ship and I'll stay and warn the Thals. <br>
SUSAN: No, we're all in this together. We're all going to stay here. <br>
IAN: Susan, you do as I say! You go back to the ship with Barbara and
your grandfather. <br>

TEMMOSUS: Daleks, can you hear me? Daleks, the Thal people wish to live
in peace. If this is your wish too, then let us work together to
rebuild our world. We need your help, and in return we'll make the soil
live again, grow crops, build homes. The time for enmity is passed. If
this is the kind of future that you want, then send for us and we shall

must go back nearly half a million years. <br>
DYONI: The complete history of our planet Skaro is here. It seems now

DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense, young lady. Your survival is all here. What, er,
is this a solar system? <br>
DYONI: Yes. Skaro is the twelfth planet. Here. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And this? What is this planet? <br>
DYONI: Each of these maps is a tiny section of another solar system, so
the total picture can be built up. <br>
DOCTOR: Total? Oh, you have records of other systems? <br>
DYONI: Yes. Well, I say total. Of course, we were only able to map out
as far as our electroscopes allowed. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. I wonder if I could see the plans. <br>
DYONI: Oh, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: I might be able to fix our position. Oh, yes, yes. Absorbing,

SUSAN: Grandfather seems to be enjoying himself. <br>
ALYDON: Some of the children have heard something moving in the forest.

IAN: It can't be the Daleks. They told us they couldn't come out of the

ALYDON: Nevertheless, I think we should all be on our guard. <br>

DYONI: I'll get some ointment, and something to cover the burns. <br>
SUSAN: We've got some in the ship. <br>
DYONI: There's some over here. <br>
GANATUS: We tried to go back for Temmosus. <br>
ELYON: Temmosus? What's happened to Temmosus? <br>
GANATUS: It was hopeless. <br>
ALYDON: These are the people the Daleks were holding prisoner. This is
the man who shouted to warn us. <br>
GANATUS: Thank you. Did the others get away, Alydon? <br>
ALYDON: Tecanda was killed. <br>
ALL: Tecanda? <br>
ALYDON: The rest of us escaped. <br>
BARBARA: The burns don't seem to be too bad. <br>
DYONI: I'll get some water for him to drink. Can you manage? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
GANATUS: Have you decided what we're going to do, Alydon? You must take
the place of Temmosus now. <br>
ALYDON: Yes. Yes, I know. If only I knew why the Daleks hated us. If I
knew that, I, I could alter our approach to them, perhaps. <br>
IAN: Your leader, Temmosus. <br>
ALYDON: Yes? <br>
IAN: Well, he appealed very sensibly to them. Any reasonable human
beings would have responded to him. The Daleks didn't. They obviously
think and act and feel in an entirely different way. They just aren't
human. <br>
GANATUS: Yes, but why destroy without any apparent thought or reason?
That's what I don't understand. <br>
IAN: Oh, there's a reason. Explanation might be better. It's stupid and
ridiculous, but it's the only one that fits. <br>
ALYDON: What? <br>
IAN: A dislike for the unlike. <br>
ALYDON: I don't follow you. <br>
IAN: They're afraid of you because you're different from them. So
whatever you do, it doesn't matter. <br>
DYONI: What would you have us do? Fight against them? <br>
IAN: I didn't say that. But you must teach them to respect you. Show
them some strength. <br>
DYONI: But you really believe we ought to fight. <br>
IAN: Yes, I think it may have to come to that. <br>
DYONI: You understand as little about us as the Daleks do! <br>
IAN: What would you do if the Daleks could leave their city? If they
came up here and attacked you? <br>
ALYDON: We would go away, back to our plateau where we came from. <br>
BARBARA: You'd simply run away? <br>
IAN: Alydon, you can't go on running away. There are some things worth
preserving. <br>
GANATUS: We're not afraid to die. Temmosus proved that. <br>
IAN: I am not talking about dying. Look, you can't hand yourselves over
to the Daleks. Sooner or later, they're going to try and destroy you if
they can. <br>
ALYDON: I can see you want to help us, but as Dyoni says, you don't
understand. There can never be any question of the Thals fighting the
Daleks. Come, Ganatus. <br>
BARBARA: I don't understand them. They're not cowards, they don't seem
to be afraid. Can pacifism become a human instinct? <br>
IAN: Pacifism? Is that it? Pacifism only works when everybody feels the
same. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, but are they really pacifists? I mean, genuinely so. Or
is it a belief that's become a reality because they've never had to
prove it. DOCTOR: I say, I say, I think these'll interest you.
(pictures) Look here. This is these people's ancestor, the original
Thal male. There was a neutron war here. Most died and the survivors
mutated. But in the case of the Thals, mutation came round in full
circle then refined itself into what you see. <br>
IAN: You mean this (humanoid) became <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. It took hundreds of years, of course. In the second
example, our recent hosts, the mutation has not completed its full
circle. Why, I don't know. But do you remember that monstrosity we took
out of its machine? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: This is its forebear. <br>
IAN: The original Dalek. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. They called them Dals then. Oh, it's all there, every
moment of it is Skaroene history. Minutely but brilliantly recorded.
Priceless, absolutely priceless. <br>
BARBARA: Is this a sword the Thal's holding? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. They were the warriors then. <br>
BARBARA: Were they? <br>
DOCTOR: Undoubtedly. <br>
SUSAN: Antodus is feeling much better. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm very glad to hear he's improving. Well, now, I'm sure you
all agree with me, its time we went back to the ship. Now, come along. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, Grandfather, couldn't we stay a bit longer? The Thals are
such nice people. <br>
DOCTOR: And the Daleks are not, which is more important, my child. <br>
(A cortege walks past, carrying Temmosus' body) <br>
IAN: I wonder if there's any point in reminding the Thals of what they
used to be? <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, they're opposed to fighting. We were trying to convince
them that it was a necessity for their own survival. <br>
DOCTOR: But our fate doesn't rest with the Thals, surely. Let's leave
well alone. We have ourselves to worry about. Now, come along, come
along. Wasting time. <br>
IAN: Maybe the Doctor's right. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. Let's get in the ship and get as far away from here as
possible. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, please, come along. Oh, by the way, let me have the fluid

I can't start the ship without it. <br>
IAN: The fluid link. <br>

There's always a way. <br>
SUSAN: You always think of something, Grandfather. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, my dear. Your faith is something that I prize very
highly. You all realise, of course, we cannot succeed against the
Daleks alone? <br>
BARBARA: Of course not. <br>
DOCTOR: We have a ready-made army here. The Thals. They're strong, and
they have one great advantage against the Daleks. They can move so much
more quickly. <br>
IAN: They have one great disadvantage. They have no arms or ammunition.

DOCTOR: Well, that's all right, young man. The mind will always
triumph. With me to lead them, the Thals are bound to succeed. <br>

difficult. <br>

Thals to attack the city, we could beat the Daleks and get the link
back. <br>
DOCTOR: It's just common sense. Young lady, I've been underestimating
you. <br>
IAN: I will not allow you to use the Thals to fight for us. <br>

BARBARA: Except mine and Susan's and the Doctor's? <br>
DOCTOR: Quite so. <br>
IAN: The only way the Thals can fight is if they themselves want to. It
must have nothing whatsoever to do with us. <br>
SUSAN: I know what you mean. We must help the Thals to save themselves
and not just them help us. <br>
IAN: Exactly. <br>
BARBARA: All you're doing is playing with words. <br>
DOCTOR: We need action, not arguments. <br>
IAN: Now listen, you two. What victory are you going to show these
people when most of them have been killed? A fluid link? Is this what
you're going to hold up to them and say, 'Thank you very much. This is
what you fought and died for'? <br>
SUSAN: The thing is, can the Thals still fight? <br>
IAN: Well that's what we've got to find out. Are they cowards, or are
they just against fighting on principle? <br>
BARBARA: Well, how can we find out? <br>
IAN: Well, I've got an idea. But whatever I do, don't interfere. I'm
not even sure that I'm right. <br>

They could rob, they could steal. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's see what he's up to. <br>
IAN: They could even kill you. And you wouldn't lift a finger to help
yourselves. <br>
ALYDON: We will not fight. There will be no more wars. Look at our
planet. This was once a great world, full of ideas and art and
invention. In one day it was destroyed. And you will never find one
good reason why we should ever begin destroying everything again. I'm
sorry. <br>
IAN: You're not sorry. You stand here, mumbling a lot of words out of
your history. But it means nothing, nothing at all. You carry this
around with you. Your history records. Well, it must be valuable to
you. Supposing I take it down to the city and try and trade with the
Daleks? Perhaps they'd think it valuable enough to exchange for our
fluid link. <br>
ALYDON: I don't believe you'd do it. <br>
IAN: I would. <br>
ALYDON: None of us would stop you. <br>
IAN: If I don't get the fluid link back, the four of us will die.
Perhaps the Daleks are more interested in people? Maybe they were
holding us to experiment on us? I could take them an alternative. <br>

ALYDON: You see, we cannot stand by and let these people die. If we do
not help them, it would be the same as if we had killed them ourselves.
Well, the way I have reasoned is this. The Daleks are strong and they
hate us. And I am sure they will find a way to come out of their city
and kill us. So it is not merely a question of whether we go off in a
vain search for food and in all probability starve to death. We face
death now. In the city is enough food for all of us and all of the
Daleks, a hundred times over. My conclusion is this. There is no
indignity in being afraid to die. But there is a terrible shame in
being afraid to live. If none of you agree with my reasons, then let me
go with these people, and I will help you elect a new chief. <br>

one to distract the Daleks on the city wall side, and the others to try

ANTODUS: But the others don't. <br>
GANATUS: We promised Alydon we'd find a way through the mountains, and
that's what we're going to do. <br>
ANTODUS: You'd never get the others to follow you if you told them what
happened the first time. It's your duty to tell them. How we watched
Amezus dragged beneath the waters of the lake, while you and I ran in

uncomfortable. <br>
IAN: Yes, I see what you mean. <br>
GANATUS: The ground's very uneven. Sometimes rock, sometimes thick mud.
You'll have to watch how you walk. I think it'll be a wise plan to find
a place to rest for the night. <br>
IAN: Yes. We've made very good time. It's only taken four hours to get
here from the edge of the forest. That leaves us with two and a half
days to go through the mountains to the city. <br>
GANATUS: If there is a way through. <br>
IAN: We'll find a way. I'll go and give Barbara a hand. <br>
GANATUS: I'm surprised you let her come. <br>
IAN: I'd be more surprised if I could have stopped her. How are you
doing? <br>
(Barbara is wearing a pair of the Thal's leather trousers with cut outs
on the outside of the legs, and sandals) <br>
BARBARA: Fine. Oh, I'm glad the mountaineering's over. <br>
IAN: There'll be some more once we get through this little lot. <br>
BARBARA: We're going through there? <br>

half days, and we've got to make it. <br>
BARBARA: Well I think we could all do with a rest. <br>
IAN: No, we'll keep up with the others. They'll be breaking camp soon.
Now take care. Watch where you put your feet. All right? <br>
(A little further on) <br>
GANATUS: This looks like a fairly dry section. <br>
IAN: Yes, this'll do. <br>
GANATUS: Right, we'll make camp here. See if we can gather up some dry
branches. <br>
IAN: All right. <br>
GANATUS: It'll make it more comfortable to sleep on. Barbara, you see

BARBARA: Right. <br>
GANATUS: At least it might stop some of these, these things from
bothering us. <br>
(As they settle down for their meal, the swamp gets very noisy. Ian
washes his face in the water. Something with glowing eyes rises up in

GANATUS: Yes, I know, but I think you two Earth people should get as
much sleep as possible. We're more used to this kind of life. It's over
a year since we left our own plateau in search of a new source of food.
I'd almost forgotten what it was like to stay in one place and enjoy
it. I suppose there'll be an end to it one day. <br>

ELYON: Come and see what I found by the lake. <br>
GANATUS: Right. <br>
IAN: Hold on. I'll come with you. Morning. <br>
BARBARA: Morning. Oh, for a feather pillow and a spring mattress. <br>
(By the lake) <br>
GANATUS: What did you see? <br>
ELYON: Over there. <br>
(Pipes running from the rocks into the lake) <br>
IAN: We were right. The Daleks do get their water from the lake. <br>
GANATUS: But how would it get to the city from there? <br>
IAN: Well, there must be a way. I mean, the Daleks aren't very mobile.
They must have cut a pathway through there to work on the pipeline. <br>
GANATUS: How long do you think it will take us to reach there? <br>
ELYON: Most of today. If we could cross the lake we could reach it much
quicker. <br>
IAN: I'm sorry, that's one way I'm not going. <br>
ELYON: Well, it would be dangerous, certainly. The lake is full of
mutations. <br>
GANATUS: No, we must go round. <br>
IAN: Yes, and we ought to try and get there before the sun goes down. <br>
ELYON: Well I'll just go and fill the water bags. (a little away from
Ian) There's no point in trying to cross the lake, you think? <br>
GANATUS: No. No, he's right. Anyway, think how long it would take to
build a light raft. <br>
(Back at the camp) <br>
IAN: Barbara, we saw some pipes going into the lake. <br>
BARBARA: So we can go through? <br>
IAN: Maybe. With a bit of luck, eh? Thanks. (for the hot drink) Mmm.
Good. <br>

have to destroy? Can't you use your brains for right? <br>
DALEK: Only one race can survive. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you planning? <br>
DALEK: We wish to escape captivity. Go out and rebuild the planet
Skaro. Our oxygen distributors will be subjected to waste radiation by
the ejector capsule. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing can live outside if you do that. Nothing. <br>
DALEK: Except the Daleks. <br>

IAN: Did you look all round it? <br>
KRISTAS: Yes. There's no way through. <br>
GANATUS: Then we'll have to go back. We came this far. We've done our
best and more. First Elyon died, and now my brother. For what? Can't
you see there isn't any sense in it anymore. <br>
BARBARA: We can't give up now. <br>
GANATUS: What is it that you want us to do? <br>
IAN: We must go back and find another way. <br>
GANATUS: Oh, why don't we just give up? <br>
IAN: Because your brother died, for one thing. He gave us a chance. <br>
GANATUS: My brother didn't want us to come. He said we'd all die. <br>
(The fire in the storm lantern starts to fade) <br>
BARBARA: What's the matter with it? <br>
KRISTAS: I don't know. Dirt's got into it, I expect. And if we're going
back, we'll have to go back now. We can't cross the chasm without

DALEK 1: A ship? What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: A machine. <br>

DOCTOR: But I have. <br>
SUSAN: It's true. We have. <br>
DALEK 1: You are not capable of creating such a machine. <br>
DOCTOR: And you took a part of my ship away from one of my companions.
The young man. <br>
DALEK 1: What did it look like? <br>
DOCTOR: A small rod with metal at either end. It belongs to my ship. A
fluid link containing mercury. Examine it for yourselves. You will see
it's part of a complicated machine. <br>
DALEK 1: Yes, I have it here. <br>

build another? <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
DALEK 1: Where is this machine? <br>
DOCTOR: In the petrified forest outside the city. <br>
DALEK 1: Good. When the neutron operation has been completed, we will
find a way to travel outside the city limits. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
DALEK 1: We will examine your machine. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Not unless you stop what you're doing. Otherwise I won't
explain its secrets to you and its philosophy of movement. <br>

granddaughter and I. Thank you all the same. It's a nice gesture on
your part. You know, this soil is not quite so barren as you think.
I've been making tests, and even you might live to see and hear the

Never. But I might just say this to you. Always search for truth. My
truth is in the stars and yours is here. <br>
