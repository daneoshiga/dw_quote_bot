<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A little man in a bowler hat watches the
customers enter the big top of the International Circus. He walks round
the back, past the lion's cage and finds a quiet spot to light up a
small cigar. We hear the sound of the Tardis materialising and a motor
horse box suddenly appears in the open ground before him. Agog, the man
walks over and looks round it while a trim man in black suit and
gloves, and with a neat beard gets out.) <br>
ROSSINI: (Italian) Who the heck are you? Well? <br>
MASTER: I am usually referred to as the Master. <br>
ROSSINI: Oh? Is that so? <br>
MASTER: Universally. <br>
ROSSINI: Well, I am Luigi Rossini, internationally, and conjurers I
don't need. Okay? <br>
MASTER: Unfortunately I need you, Lew Russell. <br>
ROSSINI: (London) What did you call me? <br>
MASTER: Lew Russell. It happens to be your real name. <br>
ROSSINI: Now listen, Mister. Get off my pitch while you're still safe!.
<br>
MASTER: Why, you insolent primitive. <br>
ROSSINI: Oh, so you it want the hard way, do you? Right. <br>
(Rossini goes to grab the Master, but it is his wrist that is taken in a vice-like
grip. Rossini is forced to his knees and their eyes meet. After a few
moments the Master lets Rossini go and walks a few steps, then snaps
his fingers. Rossini gets up and follows.)

DOCTOR [OC]: (sings) I don't want to set the world on fire! <br>
(Bang! and smoke comes out of the open Tardis door, followed by the
Doctor carrying a piece of dematerialisation mechanism. He goes to the
lab bench and places it in a device clearly designed to hold the three
legged item. There is a knock at the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not today, thank you. <br>
(Jo Grant enters, carrying a file.) <br>
JO: Doctor, I, er <br>
DOCTOR: I said not today, thank you. <br>

smoke.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh no! <br>
JO: It's all right. I've dealt with it. <br>
DOCTOR: Dealt with it? You've ruined it! <br>
JO: But your bench was on fire. <br>
DOCTOR: Three months delicate work and now look at it, you ham-fisted
bungler. <br>
JO: But this whole place might have gone up in flames. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear young lady, steady state micro-welding always creates
more smoke than fire. <br>
JO: Steady state micro-welding? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. An advanced engineering technique pioneered by the
Lammerdenes. A remarkably gifted race. They have nine opposable digits.
<br>
JO: Nine what? <br>
DOCTOR: Nine opposable digits. Yes, well, never mind. Look, I said I
don't want any tea today, thank you. <br>
JO: I'm not the tea lady. <br>
DOCTOR: Then what the blazes are you doing in here? <br>
JO: I've <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you know this area is strictly out of bounds to everybody
except the tea lady and the Brigadier's personal staff? <br>
JO: I'm your new assistant. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. <br>
JO: The Brigadier sent me along to introduce myself, Doctor. Josephine
Grant. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do, Miss Grant? I really don't think you're
suitable. <br>
JO: I'm a fully qualified agent, you know. Cryptology, safe breaking,
explosives. <br>
DOCTOR: Fire fighting? Yes, well, I'm sorry, my dear, but what I need
is a scientist. <br>
JO: I took general science at A-Level. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you did, but, even so. <br>
JO: I'm sorry I ruined your experiment. <br>
DOCTOR: That's all right. <br>
(Jo brings the file over to the bench.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, Miss Grant, I've got a great deal of work to do. You must
excuse me. <br>
JO: The Brigadier wanted me to show you this report. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm? <br>
JO: Something was stolen for the Natural Space Museum. It was on loan
from this HQ. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, what was? <br>
JO: A translucent polyhedron, eight and a half inches in diameter. <br>
(The Doctor grabs the file.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's the Nestene's energy unit. It should never have
left this building. <br>
JO: Apparently they wanted it for a special display. The Brigadier
signed the authorisation. <br>
DOCTOR: The Brigadier's an idiot! I knew I should have destroyed that
thing but somehow it would have felt like murder. <br>
JO: You mean it was alive? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, in a way. Yes, that container held a form of alien
intelligence. <br>
JO: But you've just got to be joking. <br>
DOCTOR: There's precious little to joke about, Miss Grant. That thing
is appallingly dangerous. <br>
JO: But who would want to steal it? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Who and why?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Two radio telescopes and several microwave relay
towers are dotted about at the site of the Ministry of Technology's
Beacon Hill Research Establishment. A man in a brown suit climbs the
long metal staircases to a control cabin in amongst them and enters.
The bearded man in a white lab coat speaks first.) <br>
GOODGE: I told her again last night. <br>
PHILIPS: Hmm? <br>
GOODGE: Elsie. Cut out the hard-boiled eggs, I said. Quite apart from
their effects on my digestion, they're aesthetically boring. <br>
PHILIPS: Uh huh. <br>
(Goodge takes a paper tape printout from a computer as the Master looks
in through the window.) <br>
GOODGE: Here you are. <br>
PHILIPS: Oh, thank you, Goodge. <br>
GOODGE: Will there be anything else? <br>
PHILIPS: Er, not for the moment. Oh, by the way, talking of eggs, I
want a four hour scan below the hydrogen line tomorrow. <br>
GOODGE: All right. <br>
PHILIPS: I'll give you the precise wavelength later. <br>
(Philips leaves and heads back to the ground. Goodge gets out his
thermos and lunch box. There are two hard boiled eggs in with his
sandwich. The Master enters and points a light-emitting device at the
back of Goodge's head. A sort of evil sonic screwdriver. Philips
arrives in the main control room as the Master brings a UNIT ammo box
into telescope control and takes out the Nestene energy unit. He plugs
it into a control panel then reorients the radio telescopes.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: You've been agitating for a new
assistant ever since Miss Shaw went back to Cambridge. <br>
DOCTOR: Liz was a highly qualified scientist. I want someone with the
same qualifications. <br>
BRIGADIER: Nonsense. What you need, Doctor, as Miss Shaw herself so
often remarked, is someone to pass you your test tubes and to tell you
how brilliant you are. Miss Grant will fulfil that function admirably. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what's the girl doing here anyway? UNIT's no place for
trainees. <br>
BRIGADIER: No, I couldn't agree more, Doctor, but Miss Grant was very
keen to join us and she happens to have relatives in high places. <br>
DOCTOR: So you tried to palm her off onto me. Well, it won't work,
Brigadier. I'll have a properly qualified assistant or none at all. <br>
BRIGADIER: Very well, Doctor. I'll reassign her. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
BRIGADIER: But I think you should break the news to her yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, now, wait a minute. <br>
(Jo enters.) <br>
JO: Hi, Doc. I. Good morning, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Good morning, Miss Grant. <br>
JO: I've checked all incoming reports. Still nothing on the stolen
meteorite. <br>
BRIGADIER: Thank you. <br>
JO: And I've chased those electronic spares you wanted. They promised
delivery tomorrow, without fail. <br>
DOCTOR: Miss Grant, I, er, I, er. Well, I don't. This is, er, a bit
difficult for me to say but. Er. Thank you, Jo. I can see you're going
to be of great help to me. <br>
JO: Thank you, Doctor. Report from one our field sections, sir. Captain
Yates. Some kind of sabotage at a radio telescope. Two of their
scientists have disappeared. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me see that. (reads) We'd better get down there right away.

top of that tower. <br>

materialisation sound. A man in a pin-stripe suit with bowler hat and
furled umbrella appears in mid air.) <br>
TIME LORD: Oh, dear. Don't go away, Doctor. My co-ordinates seem to
have slipped a little. Still, not bad after twenty nine thousand light
years. <br>
(He glides to the gantry.) <br>
TIME LORD: I do hope you can spare a moment or two, Doctor?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Sarcasm always was a weak point with you, wasn't it. May I say
that I think you look quite ridiculous in those clothes. <br>
TIME LORD: I am travelling incognito. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? Why? <br>
TIME LORD: We Time Lords don't care to be conspicuous. Some of us, that
is. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, if you've come down merely to be rude <br>
TIME LORD: I came to warn you. An old acquaintance has arrived on this
planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? One of our people? <br>
TIME LORD: The Master. <br>
DOCTOR: That jackanapes! All he ever does is cause trouble. <br>
TIME LORD: He'll certainly try to kill you, Doctor. The tribunal
thought that you ought to be made aware of your danger. <br>
DOCTOR: How very kind of them. <br>
TIME LORD: You are incorrigibly meddlesome, Doctor, but we've always
felt that your hearts are in the right places. But be careful. The
Master has learnt a great deal since you last met him. <br>
DOCTOR: I refuse to be worried by a renegade like the Master. He's a,
he's an unimaginative plodder. <br>
TIME LORD: His degree in cosmic science was of a higher class than
yours. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, er, yes, well, I, I was a late developer. <br>
TIME LORD: Would you call that little surprise unimaginative? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
TIME LORD: Look through the door, but be careful. <br>
(We can see a string running across the cabin through the window. The
Doctor carefully opens the door a crack to see that it runs from the
top of the door to a cylinder balanced on the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: A volatiser. If that thing should fall <br>
TIME LORD: It'll explode and probably destroy this research centre
completely. You see, he's rigged it up so that it opening the door will
make it fall. Such an amusing idea. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you'd better think of a witty way of dealing with it. <br>
(The dematerialisation sound.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now wait! <br>
TIME LORD: Oh, good luck! <br>
(The Time Lord vanishes. The Doctor reopens the door a little and feels
for the end of the string, then he steps back, bursts in and catches
the volatiser just before it hits the floor.)

investigated this matter. <br>
DOCTOR: Where's Lethbridge Stewart? <br>
YATES: He and Miss Grant are questioning the staff. <br>
DOCTOR: Huh. A fat lot of use that'll do. <br>
DIRECTOR: After all, it's hardly an international matter, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: I understand you've lost a couple of scientists. <br>
DIRECTOR: Yes. Professor Philips and his assistant, Goodge. <br>
(The Doctor picks up the half eaten hard-boiled egg from the table.) <br>
DIRECTOR: Goodge must have left in quite a hurry. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, he must. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, no! <br>

DOCTOR: A Nestene is a ruthlessly aggressive intelligent alien life
form. <br>
JO: Well, what do they look like? <br>
DOCTOR: Well I expect myself their basic form is analogous to a
cephalopod. <br>
JO: What's a cephalopod? <br>
DOCTOR: An octopus. I thought you took an A-Level in science. <br>
JO: I didn't say I passed. Urgh, an octopus. <br>
DOCTOR: They manifest themselves as a disembodied, mutually telepathic
intelligence. <br>

YATES: They make themselves bodies when they need them. <br>
JO: You mean like Frankenstein? <br>

quite finished asking questions? <br>

contain energy into that surviving Nestene unit. <br>

DOCTOR: Brigadier. Look, that unit must be discovered within the next
hour. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm well aware of the urgency of the situation, Doctor.
If we had some idea where its been taken. <br>

DOCTOR: You thought that under hypnosis it was impossible for a subject

YATES: That's right. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a fallacy, Captain. The Master can completely
control the human mind. <br>
BENTON: So he can just take over anyone he likes? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not quite. No, some minds are stubborn enough to resist
hypnosis. In any case, it doesn't last. Away from the Master's
influence, the mind struggles constantly to free itself. <br>
YATES: Is she in some sort of a trance? <br>
DOCTOR: I think the current jargon is schizoid dissociation. It's
because she was forced to do something against her will and her
conscious mind refuses to accept the fact. The result is a deep trauma.

YATES: Jo? Where's the Master? <br>
DOCTOR: She won't remember that. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: The cable. Pull it out! Pull it out! <br>
(The Brigadier pulls the phone wire from the socket. The Master hears
the line being disconnected and turns off his device. The Brigadier
unwraps the Doctor.) <br>
BRIGADIER: You all right, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, more or less. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm afraid I cut your connection. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, very amusing. <br>
BRIGADIER: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, remember what I told you, Brigadier? The Nestenes can put
life into anything made of plastic. Anything at all. <br>
BRIGADIER: I see. And there's a lot of plastic around. <br>
(The coach drives past a motor bike waiting in the bushes. The rider
starts it up and follows. The Doctor is testing his head theory on the
daffodil.) <br>
YATES: Doctor? Doctor? <br>
(Nothing happens so the Doctor puts the bunsen burner down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I was wrong. It isn't heat. Well? <br>
YATES: Message from the Brigadier. <br>
DOCTOR: What is it this time? <br>
YATES: It's about these daffodils. <br>
DOCTOR: What about them? <br>
YATES: You remember we had a report of a plastics promotion tour? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. <br>
YATES: Well, er, they're handing out daffodils. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are? <br>
YATES: Chaps in weird carnival masks, touring round in a coach. <br>
DOCTOR: Did they say how many they'd given out? <br>
YATES: No, they didn't. We've got no idea at all, I'm afraid. We don't
even know how long they've been doing it. The thing is, the Brigadier
wants to know if the daffs are dangerous. <br>
DOCTOR: That, Captain Yates, is what I'm trying to find out.

BRIGADIER: Excellent. Where was it? Well, give me the grid reference.
Yeah. No, just maintain contact. I want to tackle them in open country.
Good. Keep me informed. <br>
(He makes a second call.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart here, I want a call to the RAF please.
Priority red one. Strike command.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Excuse me, Jo. <br>
(The Doctor puts a slide with a piece of daffodil onto a small
contraption on the bench.) <br>
JO: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: This is a section of that daffodil. I'm trying to find out its
molecular structure. <br>
(The results start to come up on a monitor.) <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
(A series of hexagons appear.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, what's this? A programme pattern. <br>
JO: A programme pattern? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, these daffodils have their instructions imprinted on every
cell. It's a weapon of some sort, but what sort? <br>
JO: Well, will those signs help you find out? <br>
DOCTOR: They will if I can translate them. <br>
(The Brigadier and Yates enter in combat gear.) <br>
DOCTOR: My word, you look very fierce. <br>
BRIGADIER: We've located that coach load of Nestene Autons distributing
those daffodils, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
BRIGADIER: They're hiding in that same quarry where they took you. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's curious. Was the Master with them? <br>
BRIGADIER: I couldn't say. You might be able to identify him
afterwards. <br>
DOCTOR: Afterwards? <br>
BRIGADIER: I've got the RAF to lay on a rocket strike. In a few hours
time, that coach should be a pile of scrap iron. <br>
DOCTOR: The military mind at its most scintillating. Faced with a
problem they blast it off the face of the earth. <br>
JO: What do you think we should do? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Keep them under observation for a while and give me a
chance to find out the purpose of these flowers. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Doctor. I can't afford to take that risk. If that
coach moves to a populated area, it'll be impossible to destroy it. The
strike will go ahead as planned. <br>
DOCTOR: Captain Yates? <br>
(The Brigadier leaves.) <br>
YATES: Yes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: How long have we got? <br>
YATES: About an hour and a half. The RAF boys are setting things up now
and we have established an observation point at the quarry. <br>
JO: Mike, can we reach you there? <br>
YATES: Sure. We'll be in radio contact with HQ and with the RAF. You
can get us on one of these. <br>
(Yates gives a radio to Jo.) <br>
YATES: See you, Doc. Bye, Jo. <br>
(Yates leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: An hour and a half.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JO: But won't that programme pattern be a Nestene?
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well done. That's why I'm converting it to visual symbols.
Ah, here it comes. <br>
JO: That's a face. A part of one. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, a nose and a mouth. <br>
JO: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: I've no idea. <br>
JO: So what next? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if it is a weapon, we must find out what triggers it off.
Jo, get in touch with the Brigadier, will you? See if he can hold up
that air strike. I must have more time. <br>
(Jo uses the radio.) <br>
JO: Hello, Greyhound. This is Trap One. Do you read me? Over. (static)
There seems to be something wrong. Hello, Greyhound. This is Trap One.
Do you read me? Over. <br>
(The daffodil turns towards them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, look! <br>
JO: It's alive! <br>
DOCTOR: Short wave radio. You must have triggered it off with that
walkie-talkie. Of course. They must be planning to set them all off at
once with a gigantic radio signal. If I could only find out the
direction of the signal. <br>
JO: It seems to be looking for something. <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, be careful. Jo! <br>
(The daffodil sprays out a liquid at Jo's face. It hardens instantly,
blocking Jo's nose and mouth. The Doctor has to use an aerosol to get
it off her skin.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's all over. You all right? <br>
JO: Just a bit short of breath. What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, your nose and mouth were sealed off with this. <br>
JO: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Plastic film. You would have been unconscious in two minutes,
dead in under ten. <br>
JO: So all those people were killed by the daffodils? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, they must have triggered them off accidentally, just
as you did. Jo, do something for me, will you? <br>
JO: Yes, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Get in touch with that idiot Brownrose. See if plastic
daffodils were found at the scenes of any of those deaths. Oh, and ask
him if anybody was using short wave radios, will you? <br>
JO: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: You all right? <br>
JO: Fine, Doctor. And thank you.

BENTON: Thank you, Eagle. Message confirmed. Over and out. That's it
then, sir. Air strike confirmed. <br>
BRIGADIER: Right. <br>
YATES: No word from the Doctor then, sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: No. The air strike's due to begin in thirty seven minutes.
If the Doctor's coming up with anything, he'd better be quick.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Now why wasn't this stuff found on the
bodies? <br>
(The Doctor sniffs the plastic film, then breathes hard on it. It
shrivels in his hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Dissolved by carbon dioxide from the lungs. <br>
MASTER: Good afternoon, Doctor. <br>
(The Master comes down the spiral staircase, holding his cylinder
weapon ready.) <br>
MASTER: I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, indeed not. You've come here to kill me, of course. <br>
MASTER: But not without considerable regret. <br>
DOCTOR: How very comforting. <br>
MASTER: You see, Doctor, you're my intellectual equal. Almost. I have
so few worth opponents. When they've gone, I always miss them. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you get in here? <br>
MASTER: Oh, don't be trivial, Doctor. I see you've been working on the
Nestene autojet. My own small contribution to their invasion plan. <br>
DOCTOR: Vicious, complicated and inefficient. Typical of your way of
thinking. <br>
MASTER: Now, come, come, Doctor. Death is always more frightening when
it strikes invisibly. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, how do you intend to activate these flowers? <br>
MASTER: Oh, by a radio impulse which the Nestenes will send. I shall
open the channel for them. We've distributed four hundred and fifty
thousand of these daffodils, so when four hundred and fifty thousand
people fall dead, the country will be disrupted. <br>
DOCTOR: And in the confusion the Nestenes will land their invasion
force. <br>
MASTER: Exactly. It's a shame that you can't be here to enjoy the chaos
and destruction with me. Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
(Jo walks in just as the Master was about to shoot the Doctor. As the
Master is distracted, the Doctor grabs something from the bench.) <br>
JO: You were quite right <br>
DOCTOR: Wait! Don't shoot. <br>
MASTER: Doctor, you do disappoint me. We Time Lords are expected to
face death with dignity. <br>
JO: Oh, no! <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry. He's not going to kill me. <br>
MASTER: That is your last mistake. <br>
DOCTOR: If you fire that thing, you will never be able to leave this
planet. <br>
MASTER: You're bluffing on an empty hand, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not bluffing and my hand, as you can see, is not empty. If
you kill me, you will destroy the dematerialisation circuit from your
own Tardis. You recognise it, I feel sure. <br>
MASTER: Where did you get that? <br>
DOCTOR: The circus. <br>
MASTER: You underestimate me, Doctor. Let me be quite plain. Either you
hand that unit over to me now, or I kill Miss Grant. <br>
DOCTOR: Touch. <br>
JO: Don't! He's beaten already! They're going to bomb the quarry. <br>
DOCTOR: Jo! <br>
MASTER: Oh. There's been a slight change of plan, Doctor. I've decided
to let you live, for a little while.
