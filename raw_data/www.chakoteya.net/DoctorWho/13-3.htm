<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The pyramids of Saqqara are tumbledown piles of
mud bricks compared to those on the Giza plateau. Inside a tomb, a
large stone door is being removed.) <br>
SCARMAN [OC]: Gently. Be careful. That's it. <br>
(A tall, patrician-like man with a wonderful Roman nose enters the
unsealed room with an oil lamp and views its wall paintings.) <br>
SCARMAN: It's perfect. It's absolutely untouched. The reliquaries are
still sealed. Look at this. Great heaven, this tomb must date back to
the First Dynasty of the Pharaohs. How many thousands of years since
the priests sealed the inner chamber and draped this tapestry across
the entrance? <br>
(He pulls the tapestry aside to reveal a large Eye carved into the
stones above a set of cartouches.) <br>
SCARMAN: Achmed, your lantern, man. Quickly, quickly. It's the Eye of
Horus. <br>
ACHMED: No, Professor Scarman! <br>
(Achmed calls out in his native tongue as the local workers flee the
tomb.) <br>
SCARMAN: Come back! Come back! I need your help! Superstitious savage.
I've come too far to turn back now. <br>
(Professor Scarman starts to pry at the stones with a mattock when they
quietly slide open. He enters the inner chamber, a green light hits
him, then he screams and falls.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis is in flight, and the Doctor is just
standing still when Sarah enters in an Edwardian dress.) <br>
SARAH: Hey, Doctor. Doctor, look what I've found. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Vicky. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Where did you get that dress? <br>
SARAH: I just told you. I found it back there in the wardrobe. Why,
don't you like it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I always did. Victoria wore it. She travelled with me
for a time. <br>
SARAH: Well, as long as Albert didn't wear it. Oh, come on, Doctor.
That's worth a smile, surely? What's the matter? You should be glad to
be going home. <br>
DOCTOR: The Earth isn't my home, Sarah. I'm a Time Lord. <br>
SARAH: I know you're a Time Lord. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't understand the implications. I'm not a human being. I
walk in eternity. <br>
SARAH: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It means I've lived for something like seven hundred and fifty
years. <br>
SARAH: Oh, you'll soon be middle aged. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! About time I found something better to do than run around
after the Brigadier. <br>
SARAH: Oh, come on. If you're tired of being UNIT's scientific advisor,
you can always resign. <br>
(Just then the Tardis goes dark and tilts. A console panel explodes
then the lights come back on and Sarah sees the image of a strange
animal-like skull hanging in the air. It disappears.) <br>
SARAH: What was it? <br>
DOCTOR: The relative continuum stabiliser failed. <br>
SARAH: No, not that. I mean the thing. <br>
DOCTOR: What thing? <br>
SARAH: There was a terrible face just for a second, then it was gone.
You don't believe me, do you. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing can enter the Tardis. Unless <br>
SARAH: Unless what? <br>
DOCTOR: Mental projection of that force is beyond imagination, yet it
might explain the stabiliser failure. Let's see. Was it at this end of
the spectrum? <br>
SARAH: No, Doctor, don't! Whatever it was, I know it was totally
malevolent. <br>
(Bump.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've landed. <br>
SARAH: Where? Where have we landed? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Storage room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They step out into a room cluttered with painted
and gilded sarcophagi and boxes.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've materialised at the correct point in space, but obviously
not in time. A temporal reverse? Some vast impulse of energy has drawn
the Tardis off course. <br>
SARAH: You're saying this in UNIT HQ, but years before I knew it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SARAH: But it's so different. It can't be the same house. <br>
DOCTOR: It must be the old priory. The UNIT house was built on the
site. <br>
SARAH: The old priory was burnt down, wasn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Something's very wrong. <br>
SARAH: Doctor, I don't like it here. <br>
DOCTOR: Something's going on contrary to the laws of the universe. I
must find out what. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Study]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Somewhere in the house, someone is playing a
cabinet organ with all the stops out. The butler knocks but is not
heard, so he enters. The Egyptian theme is continued in the gilded and
coloured decor, a the mummy case on a raised dais. There is also a
desk.) <br>
COLLINS: Excuse me, sir. <br>
(The man at the organ is wearing a red fez.) <br>
NAMIN: Get out. Get out of here! (he stops playing) How dare you
disturb me? Get out. Get out at once! <br>
COLLINS: I'm sorry, sir, but the gentleman insisted. <br>
NAMIN: Gentleman? What gentleman? <br>
COLLINS: He's an old friend of Professor Scarman, sir. <br>
NAMIN: I ordered that no one was to be admitted, Collins. I told you no
callers! <br>
(The gentleman enters.) <br>
WARLOCK: Don't blame Collins. Forced entry, sir. <br>
NAMIN: This is outrageous. <br>
WARLOCK: Call it what you like. I've a few questions to put to you. <br>
NAMIN: All right, Collins. <br>
(Collins leaves.) <br>
NAMIN: So you have some questions? <br>
WARLOCK: My name is Warlock. Doctor Warlock. I live in the village, and
Professor Scarman is my oldest friend. <br>
NAMIN: I am Ibrahim Namin. <br>
WARLOCK: I know your name. It's your business that I am concerned with.
Called at the lodge on my way up. Had a word with Scarman's brother,
Laurence. He tells me you've had the infernal impudence to bar him from
this house. <br>
NAMIN: I am acting under instructions from Professor Scarman. <br>
WARLOCK: I don't believe it. <br>
NAMIN: I have his letter of authority. I have brought back from Egypt
all the relics discovered by the Professor on his recent expedition. My
orders are to store them safely and allow no one admittance to the
Professor himself returns. That is an end to it, Doctor Warlock. <br>
(Namin snatches the letter back from Warlock's hands.) <br>
WARLOCK: Oh, no, sir. Not by a long chalk! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the study]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Collins is eavesdropping.) <br>
WARLOCK [OC]: I came here to find out what's going on, and I'm not
leaving until I do. <br>
(The knob on a door across the hall is rattling.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>(Storage room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Why bother to lock an internal door? <br>
SARAH: Maybe this wing of the house isn't in use. It smells musty
enough. <br>
DOCTOR: That isn't all must, Sarah. Some of it's mummy. French
picklock. Never fails. Belonged to Marie Antoinette. Charming lady.
Lost her head, poor thing. <br>
(Collins starts to unlock the door from the other side, and the Doctor
and Sarah hide until they see who has entered.) <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, it would make an ideal headquarters for some
paramilitary organisation. This room could easily be turned into a
laboratory. Oh, hello. <br>
COLLINS: Who are you? How did you get in here? <br>
DOCTOR: Through the window. I understood the property was for sale. No?
<br>
COLLINS: Ah, you're not fooling me, sir. You came with Doctor Warlock,
didn't you. <br>
DOCTOR: Did we? <br>
COLLINS: He asked you to scout round whilst he kept his nibs busy.
Listen, if you're a friend of Doctor Warlock, sir, tell him to watch
out. <br>
SARAH: Watch out for what? <br>
COLLINS: The Egyptian. There's no knowing what he might do. He's got
the temper of the devil himself. <br>
DOCTOR: Egyptian, eh? Is this where he keeps his relatives? <br>
COLLINS: It's no joke, sir. He's only been here a few days. I wouldn't
be staying, but, well, situations aren't easy to find at my age. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you afraid of? <br>
COLLINS: He locked this wing. He didn't know there was a second key. If
he were to find me along here, let alone you two, he'd go stark raving
mad, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. In that case, we'd better leave. <br>
COLLINS: Oh, not this way, sir. Better go the way you came. He might
see you. <br>
DOCTOR: As you wish. <br>
COLLINS: And remember to tell Doctor Warlock what I said, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I'll remember. <br>
(The Doctor helps Sarah out of the window and they walk around the
outside of the magnificent Stargrove Manor, Hampshire, ducking down
under the other windows on their way. Collins watches them go, unaware
of movement in a mummy case behind him.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the study window]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WARLOCK [OC]: Utter humbug. That letter's a bogus
fabrication if ever I saw one. <br>
NAMIN [OC]: Are you alleging that it is forged? <br>
WARLOCK [OC]: I am, sir, and I intend to prove it. <br>
NAMIN [OC]: I warn you, Doctor Warlock, do not interfere. <br>
WARLOCK [OC]: Are you threatening me? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Study]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NAMIN: It is not I who threaten. There are ancient
powers gathering in this place. Powers beyond the comprehension of
unbelievers. <br>
(Namin gazes at a black-faced mummy case.) <br>
WARLOCK: Ancient balderdash. Now let me warn you, Namin. Unless you
give me some straight answers, I'm going to the police. <br>
NAMIN: To say what? That a foreigner is living in Professor Scarman's
house? <br>
WARLOCK: To say that he's not been seen for weeks. That his baggage is
lying unclaimed in his hotel. Oh, yes, I've had some enquiries made in
Cairo. <br>
(A man screams.) <br>
WARLOCK: What the devil? <br>
(Namin and Warlock run out of the room. The Doctor and Sarah climb in
through the window.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Storage room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NAMIN: Open, the fool. <br>
(The mummy case closes just before they enter. Collins is lying by the
window, his face a picture of horror. Warlock examines him.) <br>
WARLOCK: Poor fellow. He's been strangled. <br>
NAMIN: The gods have returned. I, Ibrahim Namin, servant of the true
faith, rejoice in their power. <br>
WARLOCK: Get the police. His assailant can't have got far. <br>
NAMIN: You blind, pathetic fool. The servants of the All Powerful have
arisen. When the temple is cleansed of all unbelievers, the High One
himself will come among us. This is how it was written. <br>
WARLOCK: Yes, I see. Well, I still think the police <br>
(Namin has a revolver pointed at Warlock.) <br>
NAMIN: You should have listened when I told you to leave, Warlock. Now
you have seen too much. You must be the second unbeliever to die. <br>
(The Doctor lassoes Namin with his scarf just as he fires, and pulls
him to the floor. <br>
SARAH [OC]: Come on, quick. <br>
(Warlock leaves as the Doctor holds Namin down, then leaves too. Namin
gets up, straightens his jacket, then opens the mummy case to reveal a
bandaged figure that is not quite human. There is a definite ridge
running down the middle of its face with hollows either side, and the
rib cage is very high and prominent. Namin points a scarab ring at it.)
<br>
NAMIN: Abisme, Sutekh. Molachah. T'nab. <br>
(The mummy steps down out of its case.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Priory gardens]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is half-carrying Warlock, who was shot
high in the right chest.) <br>
WARLOCK: It's no good, I can't go much further. <br>
DOCTOR: You must. We're sitting ducks if we stay here. <br>
WARLOCK: Get to the lodge. Tell Laurence <br>
DOCTOR: Laurence? <br>
WARLOCK: Marcus Scarman's brother. He live there. Knows me. <br>
(Warlock collapses.) <br>
DOCTOR: He needs help, Sarah. You go on ahead, find the lodge. <br>
SARAH: What about you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll be all right. <br>
SARAH: Okay. <br>
(Sarah runs off up the steps and through the gate while the Doctor
picks up Warlock and carries him, leaving his bowler hat behind.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Woods]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Further on, in a wooded area, Sarah hides in a
hollow as the mummy comes near. Namin finds the bowler hat and follows
the Doctor, revolver at the ready. The mummy leaves and Sarah runs off
and arrives outside the lodge. Now it is the Doctor who is hiding from
the mummy in the hollow. Namin arrives, hears something and turns.) <br>
NAMIN: The All Powerful descends. O noble god, your servant hears you.
Namin leaves, followed by the mummy. Sarah arrives with Laurence
Scarman.) <br>
LAURENCE: Oh, my dear chap. Is he badly hurt? <br>
DOCTOR: He'll be all right if we can staunch the bleeding. <br>
LAURENCE: We'd better get him back to the lodge. <br>
SARAH: Doctor, listen. I saw a mummy. A walking mummy! <br>
DOCTOR: Mummies are embalmed, eviscerated corpses. They don't walk. <br>
SARAH: But this one did. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind about that now. <br>
(Back in the study, Namin prostrates himself before the mummy case then
prays in his own language.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lodge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sarah makes Warlock comfortable on a couch in
Scarman's study and covers him with a blanket. His right arm is in a
sling.) <br>
WARLOCK: Thank you. <br>
SARAH: Now, is there anything I can get you? <br>
WARLOCK: No, no, I'm all right now. <br>
SARAH: Just try and rest, then. <br>
LAURENCE: Well, in view of what you've told me, I'm going to fetch the
police. <br>
DOCTOR: No! This is much too grave a matter for the police, Mister
Scarman. <br>
LAURENCE: Too grave? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. They'd only hamper my investigation. <br>
LAURENCE: Your investigations? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Why do you think I'm here? Something's interfering with
time, Mister Scarman, and time is my business. <br>
LAURENCE: Who are you? <br>
SARAH: Well, I'm Sarah Jane Smith. I'm a journalist. <br>
LAURENCE: Journalist? Who is your companion? <br>
SARAH: My companion? Oh, that's just the Doctor. We travel in time,
Mister Scarman. I'm really from 1980. <br>
LAURENCE: That is utterly preposterous, Miss Smith. <br>
SARAH: Yes. Sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: Interesting contraption. <br>
LAURENCE: Kindly leave that alone, sir. That apparatus is delicately
adjusted, and furthermore is a receiver containing highly dangerous
electrical current. <br>
(It looks like a sort of seismograph to me, complete with wiggly lines
on paper cylinder, yet with a perforated wheel added.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so I see. What year is this? <br>
LAURENCE: What year? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a simple enough question, surely. <br>
LAURENCE: Are you telling me you don't know what <br>
DOCTOR: If I knew I wouldn't ask. Don't be obtuse, man. <br>
LAURENCE: Nineteen hundred and eleven. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Splendid. An excellent year. One of my favourites. Yes. I
really must congratulate you, Mister Scarman. <br>
LAURENCE: On what? <br>
DOCTOR: Inventing the radio telescope forty years early. <br>
LAURENCE: That, sir, is a Marconiscope. It's purpose <br>
DOCTOR: Is to receive radio emissions from the stars. <br>
LAURENCE: How could you possibly know that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you see, Mister Scarman, I have the advantage of being
slightly ahead of you. Sometimes behind you, but normally ahead of you.
<br>
LAURENCE: I see. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sure you don't, but it's very nice of you to try. Now, why
don't you show me how this gadget works? <br>
LAURENCE: Do you mean you want me to <br>
DOCTOR: Please. Just a little demonstration. <br>
(Scarman flicks three switches then pulls down a lever, which connects
the electrical circuit with a spark and cloud of smoke. The wheel
begins to spin.) <br>
DOCTOR: Amazing. That's really amazing. <br>
(Scarman disconnects the power but the wheel continues to spin faster
and faster.) <br>
LAURENCE: I can't switch it off! <br>
(A large diode explodes and the machine finally dies.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, very impressive. <br>
LAURENCE: It's never done that before. <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating. A regular pattern repeated over and over again. <br>
SARAH: Like an SOS? <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder. Where was your aerial tuned? <br>
LAURENCE: Mars. Why? <br>
DOCTOR: I just thought I'd verify the signal. <br>
(The Doctor takes a small radio from his pocket and extends the
aerial.) <br>
LAURENCE: What's that you have, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, in principle it's exactly the same as the gadget you've
invented, only less cumbersome. Yes, it is the same signal. Obviously
automatic. Well, if it's a message, it shouldn't be difficult to
decipher. They'd want to make it easy. <br>
(The Doctor starts to make notes in his notebook.) <br>
LAURENCE: Who would? <br>
SARAH: Whoever transmitted it. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, let's see. This pattern recurs three times in one line.
Let's call that E, the commonest letter in the language. <br>
(Up at the Priory, Namin is back to belting out dramatic cords on the
cabinet organ as three mummies line up in front of the mummy case. They
raise their arms.) <br>
DOCTOR: Beware Sutekh. <br>
SARAH: Sutekh? <br>
DOCTOR: Better known to you as Set? <br>
SARAH: Of course, Egyptian mythology. Set or Sutekh was one of their
gods. He was killed by Horus, god of light. <br>
LAURENCE: Yes, but Egyptology and Mars? <br>
DOCTOR: If I'm right, the world is facing the greatest peril in its
history. <br>
SARAH: Hey, wait for me. <br>
DOCTOR: No. The forces that are being summoned into corporeal existence
in that house are more powerful and more dangerous than anything even I
have ever encountered. Stay here. <br>
LAURENCE: I've an old hunting rifle that might come in useful. <br>
DOCTOR: I never carry firearms. <br>
(The Doctor leaves.) <br>
LAURENCE: What I meant was that I should feel better if I could bring
it. <br>
(Sarah is almost out of the door.) <br>
SARAH: Bring it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Study]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor sneaks into the priory and opens the
door to the study a little. The mummy case starts to shimmer with many
colours, and the mummies back away. Namin leaves the organ to play
itself and kneels in front of the case.) <br>
NAMIN: All high, all powerful, most noble Lord, thy humble servant
welcomes thee. <br>
(From somewhere beyond, a figure in what might be a black spacesuit
appears where the case was. Out in the corridor, Sarah enters. The
Doctor gestures her to go away.) <br>
NAMIN: Master, at last you are here. I, Ibrahim Namin, and all my
forebears have served you faithfully through the thousands of years
that you have slept. We have guarded the secret of your tomb.) <br>
(The figure walks up to Namin, smoke coming from its footsteps. It
speaks very calmly.) <br>
ALIEN: Stand. Look upon my face. <br>
NAMIN: Great One, Lord Sutekh, I dare not. <br>
ALIEN: Look. <br>
(The helmet is like the faces of the mummies, only in shining black.) <br>
ALIEN: Is this the face of Sutekh? <br>
NAMIN: Master, spare me. Spare me. I am a true servant of the great
Sutekh. <br>
ALIEN: I am the servant of Sutekh. He needs no other. <br>
(Sarah, Scarman and the Doctor watch from the doorway as the alien
places its hands on Namin's shoulders. Namin starts screaming as smoke
comes from his skin.) <br>
ALIEN: Die. I bring Sutekh's gift of death to all humanity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Namin falls dead onto the floor, and the
black-clad alien transforms into a human male with pale skin and
red-ringed eyes.) <br>
LAURENCE: Marcus! <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCARMAN: Take up the generator loops. <br>
(The mummies move forward and pick up a set of canopic jars by the
mummy case.) <br>
SCARMAN: Place them in position at the compass points. Activate at
ground strength. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the study]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Quick, hide. <br>
(The three scatter as the Professor leads the mummies out of the study,
down the hallway and out of the main door. After a few moments, the
Doctor comes out from behind the potted plants and signals Scarman and
Sarah to get out of the travelling trunk.) <br>
SARAH: Where have they gone? <br>
DOCTOR: To set up a deflection field around the house. He's obviously
planned every step. <br>
LAURENCE: Who, Marcus? <br>
DOCTOR: No, Sutekh. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Study]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Sutekh is breaking free from his ancient
bonds. If he succeeds, he'll destroy the whole world. <br>
SARAH: You mean Sutekh is still alive? <br>
DOCTOR: He destroyed his own planet, Phaester Osiris, and left a trail
of havoc across half the galaxy. Horus and the rest of the Osirans must
have finally cornered him on Earth. <br>
SARAH: In Egypt? <br>
DOCTOR: The wars of the gods entered into mythology. The whole of
Egyptian culture is founded upon the Osiran pattern. <br>
LAURENCE: I'm afraid this is beyond me. <br>
SARAH: It's beyond me, too. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Found it. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The lodestone that drew the Tardis off course. <br>
LAURENCE: That's not a lodestone, that's just a sarcophagus. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It's the entrance to a time-space tunnel. <br>
SARAH: Leading where? <br>
DOCTOR: To Sutekh. <br>
(The Doctor activates a cartouche on the case and it starts to do its
multicoloured effect. <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Keep back! <br>
(Struggling to avoid being sucked in, the Doctor manages to get a
handkerchief or something out of his waistcoat pocket and throw it into
the vortex. There is a bang and he collapses.) </font></p>

traps. One snaps shut nearby. He moves forward, shotgun at the ready,
to see a mummy staggering around with the trap firmly attached to its
ankle. Finally it kneels down and pries the trap open then casts it
aside. The poacher turns and runs, pausing only to pick up his bag and
a freshly caught rabbit.) </font></p>

SARAH: They're bound to come back soon. We're trapped! Where are you
going? <br>
LAURENCE: There's a priest hole here somewhere. Marcus and I discovered
it when we were boys. <br>
(A piece of ornate wood panelling springs open.) <br>
LAURENCE: There. It isn't very large, I'm afraid. <br>
SARAH: No, well, he is though, so come and give me a hand. </font></p>

straight into an invisible wall and falls flat on his back. He gets up

off.)&nbsp;<br>

WARLOCK: Huh? What's the matter? For goodness sakes, old chap, don't
you recognise me? <br>
SCARMAN: Warlock. <br>
WARLOCK: That's right. We've all been dreadfully worried about you. <br>
SCARMAN: I came to find the other Scarman. <br>

Sutekh's will. <br>
LAURENCE: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: As a human being, Marcus Scarman no longer exists. He is simply
the embodiment of Sutekh's power. He's given the paralysed Sutekh arms

SARAH: If Sutekh is so totally evil, why didn't Horus and the other
Osirans destroy him? <br>

that they were no better than he, so they simply imprisoned him. <br>
