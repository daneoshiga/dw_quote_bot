<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The peace of a hot August day is disturbed as the
Tardis makes an unusually discreet landing near the Rue de Bethisy.) <br>
DOCTOR: Highly satisfactory.<br>
STEVEN: If anyone opens that gate they'll find the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh nonsense, my boy. It's perfectly safe in there. Yes, France.
Yes, most certainly. <br>
STEVEN: Well how do you know that? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm! <br>
(The Doctor points to a sign reading Rue de Bethisy.) <br>
STEVEN: Date? Any idea of the date, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, by the look of those houses I would say medieval.
Although I suppose it might be as late as the seventeenth century. I <br>
STEVEN: Look out! <br>
(A man comes into sight, walking purposefully to one of the nearby
houses. He knocks on the door, and it is opened.)&nbsp;<br>
GASTON: Nicholas Muss is expecting me. <br>
MAN: Ah yes. Of course. <br>
(The man goes inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Did you see that? We've landed in the middle of the sixteenth
century. Yes, and that was the very time. <br>
STEVEN: What are you talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. That strange brotherhood of apothecaries. Way ahead of
their time. Now, what was the name of that man that lived in Paris? Er,
Pre, Preslin! Preslin! That's the man. Yes. The most advanced man of
them all. I must try to get to see him.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GASTON: You're too cautious, Nicholas. The
Catholics know of only one way to settle our differences. <br>
MUSS: Times are difficult enough for us here, without you provoking
further quarrels. <br>
GASTON: I? Oh, come, be fair. Paris hates our kind. It would do
anything it can to provoke us. <br>
MUSS: You must control your temper, Gaston. It is imperative that we
keep the peace at this time.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEVEN: We're in Paris. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite so, dear boy. Well, now, don't let us dawdle. We must go
in and change. <br>
STEVEN: Well, have you got the right clothes? <br>
DOCTOR: You'd be surprised what I've got in my wardrobe. But I want to
turn over a few old papers. Yes, come along, there's no time to lose.
Come along. Come along, come along!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GASTON: Now. Now, is everybody's mug filled? <br>
ALL: Yes. <br>
GASTON: Then drink to Henri of Navarre, our Protestant prince. <br>
ALL: Henri of Navarre! <br>
DUVALL: And to his bride, our Catholic princess. <br>
(Someone splutters into his drink.) <br>
GASTON: Landlord! <br>
LANDLORD: Yes, sir? <br>
GASTON: Have you got no decent wine? Where are the Burgundies? Or even
the German wines? <br>
LANDLORD: Sir, we have the best Bordeaux on the market. <br>
GASTON: A thin Catholic brew. <br>
MUSS: Gaston, no! <br>
DUVALL: For a freethinking German, Monsieur Muss, you have some sense.
Viscount, you have insulted her Highness the Princess. <br>
GASTON: Simon Dubar, what a surprise. No doubt you visit this tavern
because the air is clearer of rigid Catholic dogma? <br>
DUVALL: You have not answered me. <br>
GASTON: Answered you? I wasn't aware you'd asked me a question. <br>
DUVALL: The insult to Princess Marguerite. <br>
MUSS: It was an accident. He choked. <br>
DUVALL: Well, then, Drink again to her. <br>
MUSS: Yes. We both will. To the Princess. <br>
(Some business that causes laughter in the tavern. Simon Duvall,
Catholic aide to the Abbot of Amboise, takes the landlord aside.) <br>
DUVALL: Most of them are in the service of the Admiral de Coligny? <br>
LANDLORD: I have to serve them, sir. I hate these Huguenots as much as
the next man, but I have to live. <br>
DUVALL: Certainly you must serve them, but watch and listen. Report to
me anything you hear or see. <br>
LANDLORD: Certainly, anything, sir. Here in Paris we know what is
right. Though people like myself with a living to earn? <br>
DUVALL: Of course. But watch your business. <br>
GASTON: Duvall, leaving us so soon? Can't you stomach the wine here? <br>
DUVALL: I have business elsewhere. After all, my dear Viscount, a
tavern is a place where a gentleman may refresh himself, while simpler
people amuse him with their badinage. <br>
(The Doctor and Steven enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: It won't be of the least interest to you, dear boy. Landlord!
Wine. <br>
STEVEN: Look, I'm not going to sit in the Tardis whilst you gallivant
around Paris. <br>
DOCTOR: I shall do nothing of the sort. I am going to visit Preslin. He
lives on the other side of Paris, somewhere near Port Saint Martin, I
believe. Thank you. I just want to sit down and have a talk with him
about his work. Are you interested in germinology? <br>
STEVEN: I don't know. What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there you are, you see. And you know nothing about the
period do you? You'd only be found out for the man that you are. <br>
STEVEN: Look, I'll be careful. I'm perfectly capable of of looking
after myself. I'll just walk around Paris and see the sights. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, in that case I shan't visit Preslin. <br>
STEVEN: Oh don't be silly. You can't wait to talk to him. Come on, you
go. I'll be all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Well. <br>
STEVEN: You'll never forgive yourself if you don't. <br>
DOCTOR: But you promise me you won't get into trouble? <br>
STEVEN: Yes, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Well try not to talk to anyone. And come back here this evening
and we'll go off to the Tardis together. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, all right. Now, you go and find your Monsieur Preslin. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite, quite. You'll need that. <br>
(He throws Steven some coins.) <br>
STEVEN: Oh, thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: And don't cut yourself with that sword. <br>
(The Doctor turns to leave, and bumps into someone in the doorway.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. <br>
(The man turns on his heel and leaves. Steven observes this, and
feeling that something is wrong, makes to follow him but is spotted by
the landlord.) <br>
LANDLORD: Here, you! It is customary, sir, to pay for the wine
consumed. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, oh, yes, of course. Here, take this. <br>
LANDLORD: The wine is two sous. I cannot change this. <br>
STEVEN: That's all I have. <br>
LANDLORD: I cannot change gold. <br>
MUSS: Can I help you? You're a stranger here. <br>
STEVEN: Yes. This man won't change my money. <br>
LANDLORD: I ask for two sous and he gives me an ecu. I cannot change
ecu coin. <br>
MUSS: Here. <br>
LANDLORD: Thank you, sir. <br>
MUSS: Is that Parisian hospitality? <br>
LANDLORD: What do you mean, sir? <br>
MUSS: The gentleman's ecu. <br>
LANDLORD: A thousand apologies. I wasn't thinking. <br>
STEVEN: Oh. Thank you. I'm afraid I don't understand your money. <br>
MUSS: Not at all. <br>
STEVEN: Excuse me. <br>
MUSS: Yes? <br>
STEVEN: Can you tell me the way to the Port Saint Martin? <br>
MUSS: Certainly, but as a stranger to Paris I think you'll have
difficulty finding it. <br>
STEVEN: Yes. Well, I've got to try. You see I must find a man called
Preslin. <br>
MUSS: I'm sorry. I don't know the name. Is anything wrong?&nbsp;<br>
STEVEN: Well, I don't know. You see the friend who was with me has gone
there. When he left here it looked as though he was followed. <br>
MUSS: The old man? <br>
STEVEN: Yes. You see, he's gone to find an apothecary there. <br>
MUSS: Is he sick? <br>
STEVEN: Oh, no, no, no. He's a scientist. He's gone to talk to him
about his idea. <br>
MUSS: A dangerous thing to do in days like these. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, well, perhaps it doesn't matter. He'll be able to take care
of himself. He usually does. <br>
MUSS: In that case you needn't worry. <br>
STEVEN: No. <br>
MUSS: I don't think you're sure. Look, come and drink some wine with us
and later I'll take you to the Port Saint Martin. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, no, thank you. But, well, I don't want to intrude. I mean <br>
MUSS: Nonsense, come and join us. Later, we'll make sure your friend is
safe. <br>
STEVEN: Well, thank you. I'm afraid I've never been in Paris before. <br>
MUSS: Allow us to be your guides.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Inside the shop owned by Charles Preslin, a man is
gathering supplies and placing them carefully in a large bag. He seems
nervous , in a hurry to complete his task and get out. There is a knock
at the door. The man looks up in alarm and makes no move to answer the
door. The caller knocks again. The door is unlocked and the Doctor
enters uninvited.) <br>
PRESLIN: What do you want? <br>
DOCTOR: I am looking for Charles Preslin. <br>
PRESLIN: He doesn't live here. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but this is his shop? <br>
PRESLIN: It was. He's gone. <br>
DOCTOR: Where? <br>
PRESLIN: He's left Paris. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear, dear, dear. Now isn't that a pity. And I did so want
to talk to him about his work. <br>
PRESLIN: Make more trouble for him? <br>
DOCTOR: Trouble? Not at all. I'm a scientist too. I merely wish to
discuss his work with him. <br>
PRESLIN: He was merely a mixer of herbs and unguents. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps to you, but he was a man who searched deeply in
nature. I didn't think he was a faint heart. <br>
PRESLIN: No, but cautious. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Yes. He also discovered, small creatures which, if
attacking humanity, could cause a very serious illness. <br>
PRESLIN: You're not French. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
PRESLIN: Yet you know of Preslin? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. In science, news travels. Yes. And there's a man in
Germany at the moment, who's working on optics, trying to make a
machine which will enable Preslin to see these small creatures. He
calls them germs. <br>
PRESLIN: Is it so? Are they really doing this? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. So now, doesn't this encourage you to continue with your
theories, Monsieur Preslin? <br>
PRESLIN: Yes, I, I am Charles Preslin. Forgive me, but in these days
one has to be careful. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, of course, my dear fellow. But I'm extremely curious
about your work, Monsieur Preslin.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MUSS: Don't mind Gaston, Steven. He's like this
with any stranger. In fact, he'd cross-question his own shadow. <br>
GASTON: Don't mock me, Nicholas. I'm in France to protect my master,
Henri of Navarre, just as you are to protect de Coligny. <br>
MUSS: You're too suspicious. Steven's been travelling abroad. He knows
nothing about what's been happening here. Do you? <br>
STEVEN: No, no. I really do know very little. <br>
GASTON: Yes, but as you come from England you must be for the Huguenot.
What you call a Protestant. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, yes, yes. <br>
GASTON: There, you see? It's just that I'm interested in our friend.
Now tell us where you've been travelling. <br>
STEVEN: Well, I've been, I've been in Egypt. <br>
GASTON: In Egypt? <br>
STEVEN: Yes. Look, I've taken up far too much of your time. Perhaps
you'd be good enough to tell me the way to the Port Saint Martin? <br>
MUSS: I'll come with you and show you the city. <br>
STEVEN: Thank you, but I really should try and find my friend. <br>
GASTON: Wise man. Nicholas here only knows the most boring places. <br>
MUSS: At least let me point out the start of your journey. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, thank you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In another part of the city, a young servant
girl, Anne Chaplet, bursts from the door of a fine house. She's clearly
terrified and runs frantically, pursued by a squad of guards determined
to catch her and take her back to the house. Tearing helter-skelter
through the crowded streets, Anne still cannot shake off her pursuers.)

tell you. <br>
STEVEN: I think I can find it now. Thank you, Nicholas. <br>
MUSS: A pleasure. <br>
(At that moment Anne, still running for her life, dashes into the
street and bumps into Steven. Terrified, she dodges past him and inside
the tavern with the guards close behind her.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CAPTAIN: Let us pass, sir! <br>
GASTON: And what do you want? <br>
CAPTAIN: The girl who came in here. <br>
GASTON: My Lord Cardinal's guard aren't you? What does he want with a
wench? <br>
CAPTAIN: She's a servant. She ran away. I have orders to bring her
back. <br>
GASTON: She doesn't appear to care for the Cardinal's service. I
suggest you let her go. <br>
CAPTAIN: She is chosen for the staff of the house of the Abbot of
Amboise. <br>
GASTON: Clearly, she likes that no more. <br>
CAPTAIN: Let me pass! My Lord Abbot shall hear of this when he arrives.
<br>
GASTON: Yes I'm sure he will. Tell him to take this story to our
Cardinal in Rome. No doubt he'll like it also. <br>
(The Captain leaves the tavern.) <br>
GASTON: There now. I thought he might be roused. What a pity. Hey,
come, Mister Englishman. Join us again. It's clearly not safe for you
to walk alone. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, but what about the girl? Where is she? <br>
GASTON: She's just a servant. A chance to bait a Catholic. Forget her.
Come, come, come.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: But, who is this Abbot? <br>
PRESLIN: The Abbot of Amboise. He hates us all. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose just now all churchmen are rather suspicious of
your work. But surely you can carry on without his knowledge? <br>
PRESLIN: Oh, you don't know the man. The Abbot of Amboise is the
Cardinal of Lorraine's right hand. With the Cardinal in Rome, the Abbot
has decided to come to Paris. We shall be hunted down. That man is far
more dangerous than the Cardinal. <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose there's no point in going to see him? <br>
PRESLIN: None, unless you want to be thrown in prison for heresy. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, I wonder.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEVEN: The girl was clearly frightened out of her
wits. We should find her. <br>
GASTON: Nonsense. She's probably gone back to her own people. <br>
STEVEN: But don't you want to know why she was frightened? <br>
GASTON: No. <br>
MUSS: Many things frighten people in Paris these days. <br>
GASTON: Hey, hey, hey, you, girl. Come here. Come on. Now then. My
friend here, whom you ran into, wants to know why you're frightened.
Come on, girl. <br>
STEVEN: For goodness sake, you're frightening her even more. <br>
MUSS: It's all right. Just tell us what it is you fear. <br>
ANNE: Nothing, sir. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, but you were running away. Why? <br>
GASTON: Louis, call back the guards. <br>
ANNE: No! <br>
GASTON: Then answer us! Why were you frightened? <br>
ANNE: Just something I overheard, sir. <br>
GASTON: What? <br>
ANNE: Well, you see, I come from Vassy. And when they said it might
happen again. <br>
GASTON: What's that? <br>
ANNE: They said it would happen again, and my father died there. <br>
GASTON: Vassy? <br>
MUSS: Calm down, Gaston. <br>
GASTON: What did you hear? <br>
ANNE: I was just passing the room and I heard them mention Vassy. <br>
GASTON: What did they say? <br>
ANNE: Something about it happening before the week was past. <br>
GASTON: Who spoke? <br>
ANNE: The Captain who followed me inside and another man. <br>
GASTON: Now tell us exactly what you heard. <br>
ANNE: Just, just the word that made me stop, sir. My father died at
Vassy and <br>
GASTON: Yes, yes, I know, but <br>
STEVEN: What are you all talking about? <br>
MUSS: Ten years ago at Vassy, a small town some miles south of Paris, a
hundred Huguenots were slaughtered by the Catholics. <br>
STEVEN: Why? <br>
GASTON: Because they were Huguenot. <br>
MUSS: Listen, girl. What do they call you? <br>
ANNE: Anne. <br>
MUSS: Anne, think back. Remember every single word the Captain and the
other man said. <br>
ANNE: But I told you. <br>
GASTON: Then tell us again.

Leran to stop you! <br>
CAPTAIN: There were too many of them. They'd have killed us before we
even found the girl. <br>
COLBERT: The girl is just a servant. She couldn't have understood us. <br>
DUVALL: If she should remember what you said and should repeat it, she
could put our friend on his guard. <br>
COLBERT: We didn't speak of him. <br>
DUVALL: Then what did you say to frighten the girl? <br>
CAPTAIN: Nothing. <br>
DUVALL: Servants don't run away from a house in fear for nothing. <br>
CAPTAIN: I think we mentioned Vassy and the celebrations here in Paris,
but nothing that anyone could've made head or tail of. <br>
DUVALL: She made something of it! Vassy. That might have been it. That
word alone is enough to put every Huguenot in Paris on his guard. <br>
COLBERT: I will go and look for her. <br>
DUVALL: You will not. You will wait here and report this to the Abbot.
It was your mistake. I'm sure he'll want to congratulate you himself. <br>
COLBERT: But. Very well. <br>
DUVALL: And you. Find out if she has any relations in Paris. If she
has, seek them out and find if she's fled there. That girl must be
found.

MUSS: No, wait. If the Catholics find her, they can easily discover
what she's told us. We must keep her out of sight. <br>
GASTON: And just what do you propose to do with her? <br>
MUSS: She can work in the Admiral's kitchen. They won't find her there.
Go to the house of the Admiral de Coligny. Tell them that Nicholas Muss
sent you. <br>
ANNE: Where's that, sir? <br>
GASTON: Oh, no one is more ignorant than the common people of Paris.
The Admiral of France lives on the corner of Rue de Bethisy and the Rue
de la Brousette. <br>
ANNE: Thank you, sir. <br>
STEVEN: But what do they mean, these things she overheard? <br>
GASTON: A threat to Navarre. I must warn him. I'll see you later,
Nicolas. <br>
MUSS: I'm afraid you've arrived in Paris at a most unfortunate time. <br>
STEVEN: I wish I understood what was going on. <br>
MUSS: My English friend, it's really quite simple. Henri of Navarre is
a Huguenot, a Protestant prince. Yesterday he married Marguerite of
France, a Catholic. The marriage was arranged by the Queen Mother in
the hope that it would heal the religious wound that's tearing France
in two. But in the light of what that girl overheard, it looks as if
the Catholics are plotting against Navarre's life. Do you understand? <br>
STEVEN: Yes. Yes, I think I do. <br>
MUSS: And now, I must leave you. I must see the Admiral at once.
Forgive me that I cannot show you Paris. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, I shall be all right. Besides, my friend should be
returning soon. <br>

and is growing increasingly impatient and anxious. He paces about
restlessly, unable to shake the feeling that something has happened to
the doctor, yet powerless to do anything but wait. Then Simon Duvall
returns to the inn and seeks out the landlord to question him.) <br>
DUVALL: Where's the girl? <br>
LANDLORD: The girl? <br>
DUVALL: The girl who fled in here this morning. What's happened to her?

LANDLORD: I don't know. I was down in the cellar and when I came up,
there she was being questioned by the Huguenots. <br>

city? <br>
STEVEN: Yes. <br>
DUVALL: I thought you must be. Most wise people are at home by this
time. It's almost time for the curfew. <br>
STEVEN: The curfew? <br>
DUVALL: Yes, an unfortunate necessity which even the marriage of
Protestant Henri to our great King's sister hasn't been able to
rectify. <br>
STEVEN: Look, I'm sorry, but I don't understand. I'm on my way back to
England. I really know very little of what's been going on here. <br>
DUVALL: I trust you've found yourself somewhere comfortable to stay
while you're here. Apartments are hard to find at this time, Paris
being so full for the celebrations. <br>

come? <br>

come back here in the morning. Landlord? <br>

lodging with the Admiral de Coligny, and will return here in the
morning. <br>
LANDLORD: Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. <br>
STEVEN: Look, this is very kind of you but I'm sure he will come. <br>
MUSS: Not now. He must be delayed somewhere. There's nothing we can do

COLBERT: And that is what happened. If it hadn't been for the Viscount
de Laran the Captain would almost certainly have caught her. It was
pure mischance. <br>
(The Abbot bangs his staff impatiently on the floor.) <br>
COLBERT: I'm sure she couldn't have made any sense of what we said.
Simon Duvall has gone to the inn where she escaped and the Captain has
gone to find an aunt of hers. I'm certain that it's only a matter of
time. In fact one of them may be bringing her back here now. <br>

of Admiral de Coligny. <br>

put on a show of trusting the Catholics. <br>
GASTON: Trust them? Ha! You know how far we can do that. You told him

GASTON: What did he say? <br>

GASTON: But we must convince them. Nicholas, you are the man's

just before she ran away, she heard them say it would happen before the

GASTON: What's the difference? <br>

MUSS: I'll come with you. <br>

GASTON: But before you go, I think you have a visitor. <br>
MUSS: Who? <br>
GASTON: Roger Colbert. Recently appointed temporal secretary to the
Abbot of Amboise during his stay in Paris. I'll wager he's come to
fetch the girl. <br>
(Gaston opens the door to the new arrival.) <br>
GASTON: An unexpected visit, Monsieur Colbert. <br>
COLBERT: Nicholas Muss? <br>
MUSS: Yes? <br>
COLBERT: Forgive me for calling on you like this, but I believe that
yesterday you were put to some inconvenience by a servant from the
household of the Abbot of Amboise. <br>
MUSS: Inconvenience? <br>
COLBERT: I understand she overheard someone say something and was
frightened by it. She ran away and I hear that you kindly gave her
refuge in the Admiral's kitchens. <br>
GASTON: And what could the Abbot say that would frighten a servant so? <br>
COLBERT: The Abbot was not then in residence. She heard someone speak
of Vassy and I believe that she was there when that unfortunate
business took place. She was frightened, I suspect, by her own memory,
rather than by anything she heard. <br>
GASTON: And do they discuss the slaughter at Vassy so glibly? <br>
COLBERT: People can talk of the town without referring to that. <br>
(A servant enters.) <br>
GASTON: Out, out, out, out, out. <br>
(The servant leaves.) <br>
COLBERT: But surely, that is the very girl. <br>
GASTON: That girl? <br>
COLBERT: Yes, her name is Anne Chaplet. Allow me take her with me. <br>
GASTON: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You really must be
mistaken. That girl is called, um, er, um, Genevieve, and she's been
working here ever since the Admiral came to Paris. <br>
COLBERT: I see. Forgive me for troubling you. <br>
(Colbert leaves.) <br>
STEVEN: That is the same man who followed my friend from the tavern. <br>
MUSS: You're sure? <br>
STEVEN: I'm positive. <br>
MUSS: But what could the Abbot of Amboise want with your friend? <br>
GASTON: Well, well, well, the Abbot has come himself, and all for the
sake of a servant. <br>
(Nicolas and Steven join Gaston at the window, from where they can
observe Roger Colbert talking to the Abbot in the street below. After a
moment, the Abbot turns and his face is clearly visible.) <br>
STEVEN: But, but that's the Doctor. That's the Doctor talking to Roger
Colbert. I must go to him. Thank you for all your help. <br>
GASTON: One moment! <br>
STEVEN: Yes? <br>
GASTON: You say that man is your friend? <br>
STEVEN: Yes. <br>
GASTON: And how long have you been working for the Abbot of Amboise? <br>
STEVEN: What? <br>
GASTON: The man talking to Colbert is the Abbot of Amboise. In what
capacity do you serve him? <br>
STEVEN: What are you talking about? Well, that man's the Doc. At least.
He's gone. It looked like the Doctor, but if you're certain <br>
GASTON: The certainty is that I don't like Catholic spies! <br>
STEVEN: I'm no spy. Listen to me. I thought that man was the Doctor. If
you say it was the Abbot of Amboise, then I must be mistaken. <br>
MUSS: Perhaps. <br>
STEVEN: Look, Nicholas, I can prove that the Doctor looks like the
Abbot. Show me the way to the Port Saint Martin. We'll go to the shop
of Preslin the apothecary, and you'll meet the Doctor. <br>
GASTON: And walk straight into a Catholic trap! <br>
STEVEN: It's no trap! Nicholas, if I were a spy would I be such a fool
as to betray myself like this? <br>
GASTON: Nicholas, it's no <br>
MUSS: I think he may be telling the truth. I'll come with you. <br>
GASTON: Yes, so will I. <br>
MUSS: No, stay here. If I don't come back, go to the Admiral. <br>

Duvall are discussing the latest turn of events.) <br>
TAVANNES: You say the Abbot went to the house himself? <br>
DUVALL: Yes, Marshall, he felt it was imperative to get the girl back. <br>
TAVANNES: The Abbot's a fool. The girl's not important. She must have
told the Huguenots all that she knows. all that she overheard. If
they'd made anything of it they'd have acted by now. All he's done is
to arouse further suspicion. <br>
DUVALL: He's an astute man in some ways. After all, without him we
wouldn't have got the help of Monsieur Bondeaux. <br>
TAVANNES: Bondeaux has yet to prove himself. Other assassins might do
as well. <br>
DUVALL: His Eminence the Cardinal trusts the Abbot. <br>
TAVANNES: Yes, I'm not sure that I do. There's something odd about all
this. Watch him closely, Simon. Make a note of everything he says or
does, and report it to me. <br>
DUVALL: Yes, Marshall. There is another matter. Nicholas Muss is
playing host to a young Englishman. <br>
TAVANNES: At de Coligny's house? Who is he? <br>
DUVALL: I don't know. <br>
TAVANNES: Hmm. Perhaps our fine Admiral is making secret overtures to
the English? <br>
DUVALL: It seems that he's a stranger to France. <br>
TAVANNES: All the more reason why Elizabeth of England should send him.
Find out more about this Englishman. Go now, and stay close to the
Abbot. And Simon, tell him I shall bring word later concerning the Sea
Beggar. <br>
DE COLIGNY: Interested in the Dutch at last, Marshall Tavannes? <br>
TAVANNES: Ah, Admiral De Coligny. I didn't hear you come in. <br>
DE COLIGNY: I hope you are looking into the plight of the unfortunate
Dutch. The sea beggars as you call them. My fight with Spain is a just
one. <br>
TAVANNES: So you frequently tell us in council. <br>
DE COLIGNY: Your only quarrel with the Dutch is that they are
Protestant and not Catholic. <br>
TAVANNES: That could also be the reason why you support them. But rest
assured, Admiral, we are examining their claim for France's aid. <br>
DE COLIGNY: That is something I suppose. <br>
TAVANNES: Tell me, have you any news from that other ally of yours,
England? <br>
DE COLIGNY: No. Why should I? <br>

DE COLIGNY: There was a lost stranger who lodged at my house last

morning, we are to join with the Dutch. Do you know, Nicholas, after
I'd explained the situation to him, he turned to me and he said, if we
do ally ourselves with the Dutch, you, de Coligny, will go down to
history as the Sea Beggar. The Sea Beggar. It's a title I'd be proud
of.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In the Council Chamber at the Louvre, King Charles
is in consultation with his advisors,
de Coligny, Toligny and Marshall Tavannes.) <br>
DE COLIGNY: If we ally ourselves to the Dutch in their conflict with
Spain, the common cause will unify the country, and prevent further
civil strife. <br>
TAVANNES: Oh, surely the marriage between Henri of Navarre and His
Majesty's sister have already put an end to the disturbances? <br>
DE COLIGNY: For how long? As I have pointed out frequently in this
chamber, it would take but one small incident and the whole of Paris
could be in uproar. <br>
TAVANNES: Incidents occur daily, yet still the city does not rise. <br>
DE COLIGNY: If we allied ourselves with the Dutch even those incidents
would not take place. <br>
CHARLES: My Admiral has a good point there. Pray accept it, Marshall,
and let us finish with this tedious business. <br>
TAVANNES: Your Majesty, France cannot afford this war. <br>
CHARLES: So we are told frequently by our mother. <br>
TAVANNES: The recent conflicts inside the country have brought us
almost to ruin. There is no money to pay for the forces that would be
needed to wage war with Spain. <br>
TOLIGNY: But is it not so that under the treaty signed at Loire, the
English will come to our assistance? <br>
CHARLES: Not you as well, my little Councillor? The Admiral and the
Marshall quarrel well enough without assistance. <br>
TOLIGNY: I apologise, Sire. I had hoped to end the deadlock between
them. <br>
CHARLES: It was good to hear a different voice. So, Elizabeth of
England has agreed to help us? <br>
TAVANNES: Does anyone here trust her? She breaks more promises than she
keeps. <br>
DE COLIGNY: She has no love for Spain. <br>
TAVANNES: She has yet to come out into the open and say so. However, if
Your Majesty is so eager to fight this war, perhaps we could raise the
money by leasing the Alpine hunting grounds to Italy? <br>
CHARLES: Do you mock me, Marshall? <br>
TAVANNES: Of course not, Sire, but the war will have to be paid for.
Some sacrifices will have to be made. <br>
CHARLES: We will give away nothing of our land. <br>
TOLIGNY: Besides, the bears there are French. They might not like to be
sold. <br>
CHARLES: Ha! True. Next winter you will accompany us on our hunt. <br>
DE COLIGNY: Your Majesty, there is enough money in France to finance
the war. <br>
CHARLES: Enough of this war. I am bored with Spain. <br>
DE COLIGNY: But I beg to advise Your Majesty <br>
CHARLES: No, Admiral, please talk of it some other time. War is so
tedious. Move to matters closer to us. <br>
DE COLIGNY: If the King refuses to make war, may it please God that
another war will not be forced on him, which it will not be easy to
renounce.

suffer these frequent violations of their rights? <br>
TAVANNES: The treaty drawn up by the Queen Mother to conclude the
religious difficulties of the country was generous in the extreme to
the free thinkers. <br>
DE COLIGNY: Words were spoken. Signatures were exchanged. But they did
not prevent many acts against the Huguenots. <br>
TAVANNES: Do you question the promises of the Queen Mother, Admiral? <br>
DE COLIGNY: It is easy to promise. <br>
TAVANNES: You speak treason! <br>

DE COLIGNY: Sire, it is imperative that the religious differences of
the country be fully discussed. <br>
CHARLES: Admiral, grant me but a few days more in which to amuse myself
and then I promise you, as King, that I shall make you happy and all
those of your religion. <br>
DE COLIGNY: Kings are recognised only by the power they wield. The
Queen Mother seems to claim this power. Take care, Your Majesty, that
it does not prove detrimental to yourself, and to France. <br>
TAVANNES: Your Majesty <br>
CHARLES: Tavannes, no more. <br>

Catherine de Medici, from the council chamber.) <br>

depart, let us do likewise. We need to get on the Feast of Saint
Bartholomew, so until the day after tomorrow, let us enjoy ourselves. <br>
TOLIGNY: Was that wise? To insult the Queen will only make her work
harder against you. <br>
DE COLIGNY: It was time her power was challenged. <br>
TOLIGNY: The King still fears his mother. Surely this may damage all
for which you've worked so hard? <br>
DE COLIGNY: Let us hope not. <br>

time of day. The perfect site for an assassination attempt. In an attic
room overlooking the street, the assassin, Maurevert, codename Bondeaux
is preparing for the task ahead of him. He opens a case and takes from
it an arquebus, a hand-held rifle of the latest design. Setting the
arquebus on the tripod-like stand, Bondeaux trains the weapon on the
street, and smiles. From his vantage point here he cannot fail to hit
his target. At the end of the street, the Admiral de Coligny appears,
returning home after the council meeting at the Louvre. He walks
slowly, engrossed in a report he's reading. A group of courtiers follow
him at a distance, talking quietly amongst themselves so as not to
disturb him. Toligny is amongst them. Bondeaux fixes his sights on de
Coligny and slowly squeezes the trigger. But a gust of wind snatches a
page of the report from the Admiral's hand and he instinctively stoops
to retrieve it just as Bondeaux fires the arquebus. de Coligny falls to
the ground.) <br>
MUSS: Admiral! Admiral! <br>
DE COLIGNY: See how honest men are treated in France? The shot came
from that window. <br>
MUSS: Search the house! We must get him to a surgeon! <br>
(The falling page saved de Coligny's life. The bullet only wounded him.
As others hunt for Bondeaux, Nicholas and Toligny help the Admiral to
his feet. But de Coligny is proud and shrugs off their supporting
hands. Unsteady on his feet, bleeding profusely, he walks away
unaided.)

every box. I must find that key. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Marshall Tavannes is in his study talking to
Simon.) <br>
TAVANNES: It may hinder the inquiry into the attempted assassination of
de Coligny. <br>
DUVALL: Surely the King is insisting that de Coligny is avenged? <br>
TAVANNES: He is. But by blaming the death of the Abbot on the Huguenots
we may be able to cover our tracks. <br>
DUVALL: Will the King pay any attention to the Abbot's death? <br>
TAVANNES: I don't know. Fortunately the Admiral himself is helping us.
He doesn't want the inquiry yet so that may give us a little time. <br>
DUVALL: Therefore the Englishman must be caught. <br>
TAVANNES: And killed. He must not be allowed to get back to the Abbot's
house. <br>
DUVALL: The men are searching Paris for him. <br>
TAVANNES: He must be found tonight. Tomorrow is Saint Bartholomew's Day
and it'll be all too easy for him to evade us in the revelry. <br>
(A messenger arrives with a note for Tavannes.) <br>
TAVANNES: The Queen Mother. She commands me to go to her. No doubt she
has thought of some further scheme to protect her good name. Wait for
me here, Simon. I may have more instructions for you when I get back.

Preslin's shop in their search for the Tardis key. There are clothes
strewn about and boxes overturned, their contents littered across the
floor. Steven is beginning to get desperate.) <br>
STEVEN: Well? <br>
ANNE: Nothing, Monsieur. There's no sign of your friend's clothes
anywhere. <br>
STEVEN: They must be here. <br>
ANNE: All I found was this. <br>
STEVEN: But, but this is his stick! <br>
ANNE: Your friend's? <br>
STEVEN: Yes. Well, his clothes must be here somewhere! Where did you
find it? <br>
ANNE: In the back, Monsieur. But there are no clothes there. <br>
STEVEN: You sure? <br>
ANNE: Yes. I've searched everywhere! <br>
STEVEN: Then why the stick? He couldn't have pretended to be the Abbot
dressed as he was, so he must have changed somewhere. But where? <br>
ANNE: Perhaps he went away somewhere with the apothecary who used to
live here? <br>
STEVEN: What, with Preslin? No, he couldn't. <br>
ANNE: Why not? <br>
STEVEN: Because Preslin is either dead or in prison. <br>
DOCTOR: He is not. <br>

de Coligny's sick bed.) <br>
GASTON: The Catholics will not rest until you are dead! <br>
DE COLIGNY: You are too impetuous, Viscount. <br>
TOLIGNY: The King is determined to prevent a further attempt. Why else
do you think he's put so heavy a guard on this house? <br>
GASTON: A Catholic guard under a Catholic commander! The Admiral could
hardly be in the care of a greater enemy. <br>
TOLIGNY: He is under the protection of the King. <br>
GASTON: And the Queen Mother. <br>
MUSS: Gaston, you are tiring the Admiral, and doing yourself an
injustice. You had better return to the Louvre. <br>
GASTON: Nicholas, no! If you were to leave Paris it would be better for
you and for us. <br>
MUSS: The surgeon said the Admiral must not be moved. <br>
GASTON: Then may God protect you. <br>
(Gaston leaves.) <br>
DE COLIGNY: I hope Henri of Navarre realises how dangerous it is to
have such a hothead in his service. <br>
TOLIGNY: He must be wrong. The commander wouldn't dare to disobey the
King after what has happened. <br>
MUSS: Let's hope so. Is there anything you need, Admiral? <br>
DE COLIGNY: Stay with me. <br>
MUSS: Of course. <br>
TOLIGNY: You must be grateful that the wounds are not poisoned, so that
there is no fear of you dying. <br>
DE COLIGNY: I do not fear death. I only hope we have nothing to fear
from my staying alive.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Oh, my dear boy, had you stayed at the
tavern all this mix-up could have been avoided. <br>
STEVEN: I did stay at the tavern, you didn't turn up! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I was unavoidably delayed. Never mind that now. Come
along, we must go. Come along. <br>
ANNE: Oh, you cannot now, Monsieur. The curfew's rung. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Oh, that wretched curfew is the start of so much trouble.
<br>
ANNE: It'll be easy to leave Paris in the morning, Monsieur. Tomorrow's
Saint Bartholomew's Day and everyone will be celebrating. <br>
STEVEN: Huh! With all the trouble that's going on I can't see what
they've got to celebrate. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you not to get involved. <br>
STEVEN: Look, I tried not to, but the Abbot did look like you, and if I
hadn't found out about Admiral de Coligny being the 'Sea Beggar' then <br>
DOCTOR: What's that? <br>
STEVEN: I tried to tell you before. Admiral de Coligny is one of the
Huguenot leaders. The Catholics tried to shoot him. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you say tomorrow was Saint Bartholomew's Day, child? <br>
ANNE: Yes, Monsieur. <br>
DOCTOR: What year is this, my boy? <br>
STEVEN: Oh, I don't know. What difference does it make? <br>
DOCTOR: What date is it, child? <br>
ANNE: Date, Monsieur? August the twenty-third as <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, I know that. The year, the year, hmm? <br>
ANNE: Fifteen seventy two, Monsieur. But surely you know that? <br>
DOCTOR: Go home, Anne. You must leave here at once. <br>
ANNE: No! I've got nowhere to go! <br>
DOCTOR: Where were you working? <br>
ANNE: At the Abbot's house. <br>
DOCTOR: You go back there. <br>
ANNE: I can't! They'll kill me! <br>
DOCTOR: You must leave this shop, child. <br>
STEVEN: Doctor, what's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, please don't interfere. Now, my dear, there must be
somewhere you can stay in Paris. <br>
ANNE: No, there's only my aunt's place, and they'll kill me there. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense. Tonight you will be quite safe. Now you go
carefully through the streets. <br>
ANNE: Well, what about the curfew? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you've been out in the curfew before, haven't you? <br>
ANNE: Yes, but the guards <br>
DOCTOR: Then you know how to avoid the patrols. You go back to your
aunt. You'll be quite safe. And you take my advice and stay indoors
tomorrow. Now do you understand? It's too dangerous for you to stay
here. Now off you go, child. Come along, off, off, off. <br>
STEVEN: Look, Doctor, I don't think you understand <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, sh sh sh sh sh sh sh. <br>
ANNE: Goodbye, Monsieur Steven. Safe journey. <br>
STEVEN: Doctor, I don't think she should go. <br>
DOCTOR: Now off you go, my child. Off you go. <br>

STEVEN: Goodbye. Look, are you sure she'll be all right? The guards are
waiting for her. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Steven, the Catholics will have other things on their
minds tonight. She will be quite safe. Now then, you and I must leave
Paris at once. Come! <br>

TAVANNES: Simon? <br>
CATHERINE: No, Marshall. <br>
TAVANNES: Madame. I apologise, I thought that <br>
CATHERINE: Never mind. I have it here, the order signed by the King.
Our plans for tomorrow can go ahead. <br>
TAVANNES: Thank God. <br>
CATHERINE: God had very little to do with it. What is this? <br>
TAVANNES: The list, Madame. When those Huguenots are killed we need
have no further fear of a Protestant France. <br>
CATHERINE: We have no need of lists, Marshall. The good people of Paris
know their enemies. They will take care of them. <br>
TAVANNES: The good people? Madame, if you rouse the mob the innocent
will perish with the guilty. <br>
CATHERINE: Innocent? Heresy can have no innocents. France will breath
of pure air after tomorrow. <br>
TAVANNES: And Navarre, Madame, your son-in-law? Is he to be slaughtered
with the others? <br>
CATHERINE: Tomorrow Henri of Navarre will pay for his pretensions to
the Crown. <br>
TAVANNES: Madame, we must not kill Navarre. <br>
CATHERINE: Must not? <br>
TAVANNES: Protestant Europe will merely shed a pious tear over the
death of a few thousand Huguenots. The death of a prince will launch a
Holy War. <br>
CATHERINE: If one Huguenot life escapes me tomorrow, we may both regret
this act of mercy. <br>
TAVANNES: Not mercy, Madame. Policy. <br>
CATHERINE: Very well, Marshall. Then you must get him out of Paris.
After tomorrow, even I could not save him. <br>
TAVANNES: I will see to it, Madame. <br>
CATHERINE: And Marshall, close the gates of the city now. <br>
(The Queen Mother leaves, and Simon enters the study.) <br>
DUVALL: Well, my lord? <br>
TAVANNES: The order has been given. You may begin. <br>
DUVALL: My men are ready. Where's the list? <br>
TAVANNES: There is no list. <br>
DUVALL: But I thought? <br>
TAVANNES: We are to unleash the wolves of Paris. None are to be spared.
<br>
DUVALL: Even better, my lord. <br>
TAVANNES: Is it? I wonder. And Simon, when you have passed on the order
I have a special charge for you. <br>
DUVALL: My lord? <br>
TAVANNES: Henri of Navarre. <br>
DUVALL: I am to have the honour? <br>
TAVANNES: Yes, but not of killing him. You will escort him out of
Paris. <br>
DUVALL: But my lord! <br>
TAVANNES: You not hear me? You will be responsible for his safety. You
will have to leave tomorrow's work to others. Now get out. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor and Steven have stolen through the
streets of Paris, but their way back to the Tardis is blocked by the
guards standing outside de Coligny's house.) <br>
GUARD 1: Oh, it's nearly dawn. <br>
GUARD 2: How many more nights have we got to watch over this Huguenot's
house? <br>
GUARD 1: Till the King decrees otherwise. <br>
GUARD 2: But why does it have to be us? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we shall have to get past them to get back to the Tardis. <br>
STEVEN: Can we make a run for it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. It's far too dangerous. <br>
STEVEN: What do we do? <br>
DOCTOR: For the moment we just wait. <br>
GUARD 2: I won't be sorry to see the night over. Hello, what's this? <br>
(A troop arrives.) <br>
GUARD 1: More orders, I expect. <br>
OFFICER: You're relieved. Go back to your quarters. <br>
GUARD 1: Relieved, sir? It's not due for an hour or more. <br>
OFFICER: Don't argue. Go quickly! <br>
STEVEN: Look, if we don't go soon it'll be light. <br>
DOCTOR: I know, I know. Just keep quiet. <br>
(The curfew bell begins to sound.) <br>
DOCTOR: There's the tocsin! The curfew's been lifted. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STEVEN: Surely there was something we could have
done? <br>
DOCTOR: No, nothing. Nothing. In any case, I cannot change the course
of history, you know that. The massacre continued for several days in
Paris and then spread itself to other parts of France. Oh, what a
senseless waste. What a terrible page of the past. <br>
STEVEN: Did they all die? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, most of them. About ten thousand in Paris alone. <br>
STEVEN: The Admiral? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
STEVEN: Nicholas? You had to leave Anne Chaplet there to die. <br>
DOCTOR: Anne Chaplet? <br>
STEVEN: The girl! The girl who was with me! If you'd brought her with
us she needn't have died. But no, you had to leave her there to be
slaughtered. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it is possible of course she didn't die, and I was right
to leave her. <br>
STEVEN: Possible? Look, how possible? That girl was already hunted by
the Catholic guards. If they killed ten thousand how did they spare
her? You don't know, do you? You can't say for certain that you weren't
responsible for that girl's death. <br>
DOCTOR: I was not responsible. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, no. You just sent her back to her aunt's house where the
guards were waiting to catch her. I tell you this much, Doctor,
wherever this machine of yours lands next I'm getting off. If your
researches have so little regard for human life then I want no part of
it. <br>
DOCTOR: We've landed. Your mind is made up? <br>
(The Tardis doors open.) <br>
STEVEN: Goodbye. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Steven, history sometimes gives us a terrible shock,
and that is because we don't quite fully understand. Why should we?
After all, we're all too small to realise its final pattern. Therefore
don't try and judge it from where you stand. I was right to do as I
did. Yes, that I firmly believe. <br>
(Steven leaves the Tardis without another word.) <br>
DOCTOR: Even after all this time he cannot understand. I dare not
change the course of history. Well, at least I taught him to take some
precautions. He did remember to look at the scanner before he opened
the doors. Now they're all gone. All gone. None of them could
understand. Not even my little Susan, or Vicki. And as for Barbara and
Chatterton. Chesterton. They were all too impatient to get back to
their own time. And now, Steven. Perhaps I should go home, back to my
own planet. But I can't. I can't. <br>
(The Tardis has landed on Wimbledon Common in 1966. A young girl is
running for help. She spots the police box at the roadside and dashes
inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? <br>
DODO: Where's the telephone? <br>
DOCTOR: What did you say? <br>
DODO: The telephone. I've got to ring up. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, pull yourself together, child. I think you've made a
mistake. <br>
DODO: Who are you? Are you the police? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious. Of course not. <br>
DODO: Well, this is a police box. It says so outside. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I know. But, er, it isn't, if you know what I mean.
Now run along and find another police box. In any case, child, what do
you want to do with the police? <br>
DODO: There's been an accident. A little boy's been hurt and I've got
to phone the police. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well, I'm afraid I can't help you. No, you must run along
and phone the police somewhere else. And the same time phone for an
ambulance. <br>
DODO: Wait a minute, if this isn't a police box, what is it? And who
are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my dear, I'm a doctor of science, and this machine is for
travelling through time and relative dimensions in space. Now you <br>
DODO: Come again? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind, my dear, never mind. Run along. <br>
DODO: There's something odd going on here. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh please, child. <br>
STEVEN: Doctor, quick! You've got to take off. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, so you've come back, my boy! <br>
STEVEN: Yes, yes, I've come back. We can't go into that now. There are
two policemen coming over the common towards the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Policemen? Coming here? Good gracious me! They'll want to use
the telephone or something like it. <br>
(The Tardis doors close and they dematerialise.) <br>
STEVEN: Oh, that was close. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, tell me, young man, what made you change your mind? <br>
STEVEN: How did you get in here? <br>
DODO: On me feet, same as you did. <br>
STEVEN: Look, do you realise what's happening? We've taken off! We
could land anywhere! <br>
DODO: We really travelling? Where to? <br>
STEVEN: But we're travelling in time and space. We're not on Earth any
more. We could land anywhere, in any age. <br>
DODO: Tell us another one. <br>
STEVEN: Doctor, how could you? <br>
DOCTOR: What else could I do, dear boy? You don't want a couple of
policemen aboard the Tardis do you? You know, you're the most
inconsistent young man? Just now you were telling me off for not having
that Chaplet girl aboard!&nbsp;<br>
STEVEN: Ah, that was different! This is no joyride you know. You may
never get home again. <br>
DODO: I don't care. <br>
STEVEN: What about your parents? <br>
DODO: I haven't got any. I live with me great aunt, and she won't care
if she never sees me again. <br>
DOCTOR: There now, you see? All this fuss about nothing. But don't you
think she looks rather like my grandchild Susan? <br>
STEVEN: You forget, I've never met your granddaughter. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no, of course not, no. Yes, but she does you
know. What is your name, child? <br>
DODO: Dodo. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
DODO: It's Dorothea, really. Dorothea Chaplet. <br>
STEVEN: Chaplet? Yes, but you're not French, are you? <br>
DODO: Don't be daft. Me granddad was, though. <br>
STEVEN: Doctor, it's not possible is it? Chaplet? Anne's great, great <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it is possible, my boy. Very possible. Welcome aboard
the Tardis, Miss Dorothea Chaplet. <br>
DODO: Dodo! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear! My dear!
