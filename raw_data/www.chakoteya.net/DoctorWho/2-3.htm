VICKI: Bennett, the rescue ship's landed. It’s arrived. We’re being
taken back. Isn’t it marvellous? <br>
BENNETT: It can’t be the ship. <br>
VICKI: Its quite clear on the detector. Listen. <br>
(They can hear the radar contact.) <br>
BENNETT: It must be a fault. Must be. Did you talk to them by radio? <br>
VICKI: No. I was going to, but I thought I’d tell you first. I thought
you’d be pleased, Bennett. <br>
BENNETT: The rescue ship's not due for another three days. It can’t
even find Dido unless we guide it down. You know that. <br>
VICKI: But it's showing on the screen. Come and look. I’ll help you. <br>
BENNETT: Did you hear it land? <br>
VICKI: No. No, I didn’t, but it <br>
BENNETT: The rescue ship can’t land silently. <br>
VICKI: It must have done. It’s just got here early that’s all. It is
here. It’s as plain as anything on the screen. <br>
BENNETT: What’s its location? <br>
VICKI: I don’t know. Somewhere on the mountain. <br>
BENNETT: Look, Vicki. I know how badly you want to get off this planet.
We both want to get away but its no good building up our hopes. Go and
radio the rescue ship. You’ll find your mistake… And Vicki, watch out
for Koquillion. <br>
VICKI: I haven’t seen him today. <br>
BENNETT: He’ll be around somewhere. And remember he knows nothing about
the rescue ship. <br>
VICKI: I know. <br>
BENNETT: So be careful. If he finds out, he’ll kill both of us.

BARBARA: And you know how the ship has a faint sort of trembling while
we’re moving? Well, I suddenly realised that it had stopped. <br>
IAN: I believe you’re right, Barbara. I think we have landed. But the
Doctor’s never slept through a landing before. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor. Doctor! <br>
IAN: Doctor! <br>
BARBARA: Wake up. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? What’s the matter? What is it? What is it? Oh good
gracious me! Don’t tell me I went off to sleep. <br>
IAN: Yes, you did. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! <br>
IAN: At a very critical time. Oh well, I suppose it did you a world of
good. <br>
DOCTOR: Deep in the arms of Morpheus, hey my boy? Well, I feel a bit
sticky. I must go and have a wash. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, but Doctor, the trembling’s stopped. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear, I’m so glad you’re feeling better. <br>
BARBARA: No, not me, the ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the. Oh my dear, I’m so sorry. <br>
IAN: Doctor, we appear to have landed while you were asleep. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Oh, I say, I must never allow this sort of thing again
now, must we? No. Well, all we have to do is to turn the power off. <br>
BARBARA: Then we have landed. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, er, excuse me, materialised, I think, is a better word.
Well now, lets have a look and see what’s doing.
Yes, the air's very good. The temperature. Yes, wherever we are, I
think its nice and fine. (Yawns) Oh, do pardon me. Forgive me, I’m so
sorry. Yes. Well, I must say, this looks most promising. Now, lets have
a little look shall we? <br>
(The scanner shows the cave.) <br>
IAN: Very dark. Can’t really make out anything at all. It looks very
rocky, whatever it is. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It does somewhat. Might be a cave, or…even perhaps
underground. <br>
BARBARA: You mean we could be trapped down here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything my dear Barbara. We
can, of course, always travel through…solid matter in flight… and all,
again, we can, we can take off again quite easily. No, I do think we
ought to step outside and have a look. I will too. Susan, er <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, why don’t you show me how to open the doors? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes, yes, yes, my dear. Of course, yes, yes, how silly of
me. Yes, number four switch. <br>
(and the doors open) <br>
DOCTOR: Very good, very good. You won’t, of course, try to do that
during transit, will you?
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: It is a cave. You were right Doctor. <br>
BARBARA: Strange funny smell. Doesn’t smell like anything on Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t my dear. No, no. But I do know that smell. <br>
IAN: You recognise it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, more or less. Oh, have a look round, I should, but
don’t go too far away. Remember we haven’t had much luck with these
caves during our travels. <br>
BARBARA: What are you going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I think I’m going to have a nap. <br>
(The Doctor returns to the Tardis) <br>
IAN: A nap? Huh. Well that’s a new one, isn’t it? He’s usually the
first one to be up and dashing off for a look. <br>
BARBARA: Maybe we’re going to see a new side to the Doctor. <br>
IAN: Yes, well, he isn’t getting any younger is he. You know, it’s the
first time he’s been to sleep during a landing. Barbara, I’ve got an
idea he’s getting a bit (hand gesture for senile) <br>
DOCTOR: Remember I can hear what you’re saying. Pick up that stone for
me, would you? <br>
IAN: This one, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
IAN: Certainly. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(The Doctor goes back inside) <br>
BARBARA: Look, Ian, all the old associations are still in the ship. You
can’t expect him to say goodbye to Susan and then forget about her the
next minute. <br>
IAN: No, I suppose not. I wonder what she’s doing now? <br>
BARBARA: If I know any…anything about David, she’s learning to milk
cows. <br>
IAN: Yes, he’s a nice chap, David. <br>
BARBARA: Come on. <br>
IAN: There may be a way over here, you know. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, but I think the sun is coming through that way. <br>
IAN: Ah, so it is.
(Ian and Barbara leave the cave, and something with spikes around its
neck, bug eyes and antennae is seen inspecting the Tardis)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ian and Barbara come out onto a ledge in front of
a sheer cliff) <br>
IAN: Barbara, look! <br>
BARBARA: It’s a spaceship. <br>
IAN: Yes… broken in two. <br>
IAN: Can you see on the side? A flag! It’s from home! <br>
BARBARA: Yes! You know it must have crashed. <br>
IAN: Yes, although you see those buildings? It might have been
destroyed at the same time as they were on the ground. <br>
BARBARA: There’s no movement. No sign of life at all. <br>
IAN: No. No, there isn’t, is there? Well, there must be people or
things on this planet. <br>
BARBARA: Ian. <br>
IAN: Hmm? <br>
BARBARA: Are you going to tell the Doctor about this? <br>
IAN: Yes. Why not? <br>
BARBARA: Well, knowing the Doctor, he’ll want to go down there and
investigate. <br>
IAN: Well, for once I’d agree with him, Barbara. If there are any of
those crew members left we should get in touch with them. <br>
BARBARA: Ian! <br>
(The thing that had been looking at the Tardis is behind them) <br>
KOQUILLION: You are strangers here. Answer my question. Do you come
from Earth? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. Yes, we do. <br>
KOQUILLION: Where is your rocket ship? <br>
IAN: You’ve just come out of the cave. You must have seen it. <br>
KOQUILLION: You landed here…in that box? <br>
BARBARA: Well I know it sounds fantastic, but we have no reason to lie
to you. <br>
IAN: Well, obviously you’ve had a good look around. Did you see any
sign of another ship having landed? <br>
KOQUILLION: Are there any other crewmembers? <br>
IAN: Yes, there is. There's one more and he’s back in the ship. <br>
KOQUILLION: I would like to meet him. Go and fetch him. I will take you
all to the city. <br>
IAN: Coming, Barbara? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
(But the creature actually blocks her way, holding something like a
wrench) <br>
KOQUILLION: Why are you frightened? <br>
BARBARA: Keep away. <br>
KOQUILLION: I am your friend. You can trust me. <br>
BARBARA: Can I? (The creature pushes Barbara over the ledge)

<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my writing gets worse and worse. Dear, dear, dear, dear,
dear. Well, undoubtedly we’ve landed on the planet Dido. How
remarkable. Well, I must say. it’ll be rather nice to meet these
friendly people again after all these years. Fancy landing back here
again. I wonder if I were to tell Ian that it was deliberate, whether
he’d believe me or not? Oh no, of course, I was asleep. Oh, pity, pity,
pity. </font></p>

(Meanwhile, Barbara is unconscious at the bottom of the cliff, holding
a broken branch. The shadow of another person falls over her) <br>

DOCTOR: Chesterton! Oh, my dear fellow, are you all right? <br>
IAN: Barbara. <br>
DOCTOR: Where is she? <br>
IAN: Barbara. I thought she was with me. I, I heard her scream… <br>
DOCTOR: Steady, steady, steady. <br>
IAN: I went back and an explosion. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, come on, get your breath back. Now, now then, you all
right? <br>
IAN: Yes… <br>
DOCTOR: well, let's try and look for her, shall we? <br>
IAN: Yes, it's…this way. <br>
DOCTOR: Be careful now, be careful. Oh, good gracious, the whole roof’s
fallen in! <br>
IAN: This blocks the cave! Barbara! <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, I hope we shan’t get another fall. I don’t think the Tardis
is likely to <br>
IAN: No use. Doctor, this wasn’t an accident. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you talking about, my boy? <br>
IAN: Oh it was a…thing, a repulsive thing with a…hideous face. <br>
DOCTOR: With hands and feet like claws? <br>
IAN: Yes, that's it. How do you know? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this is the planet Dido. I’ve been here before, I know
them very well. <br>
IAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: They’re very friendly people. <br>
IAN: Friendly? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
IAN: Oh, it certainly wasn’t friendly to us. Must have kept Barbara
back. That scream. Barbara! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh don’t for heavens sake start scratching there. Try and find
another way out. This thing, was it armed? <br>
IAN: No, no, it wasn’t. Wait a minute, it was carrying some sort of
jewelled club. About so long. <br>
DOCTOR: With a big head, resembling a spanner? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
IAN: I don’t know why you bother to ask. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that may account for this. <br>
IAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: When I was here last time, if I remember rightly, they’d just
perfected this thing. It’s a ray, used in construction work. <br>
IAN: Ahh. <br>
DOCTOR: Now look here, what about Barbara, are you all right? Are you
capable? <br>
IAN: Yes, I’m not too bad. <br>
DOCTOR: Come along. Don’t just sit there, my dear boy, stand up, stand
up. Come along, that’s it, mind your head. It’s only dust. No bones
broken. <br>
IAN: Thank you. Doctor. The most thorough-going medical I’ve ever had. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s a pity I didn’t get that degree, isn’t it? Excuse me.
<br>
IAN: You say these people were friendly? <br>
DOCTOR: Really. Very friendly people. <br>
IAN: If that’s a sample, I’ll take the Daleks anytime. <br>
DOCTOR: Now look here, you take yourself off there and try and find
Barbara. <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Come along and be careful. <br>
IAN: Yeah, we need to be careful. These people are dangerous. <br>
DOCTOR: But why? What could have happened to changed them? I wonder.

KOQUILLION: A space machine has arrived. <br>
VICKI: People? <br>
KOQUILLION: A warlike people. They wanted to pillage the ship! I could
not save them from my people, as I do Bennett and yourself. They’re
walled up in a cave. If they’re not dead already, they will die of
hunger and thirst. <br>
VICKI: I bet you never gave them a chance, you could have (he raises

the way. He doesn’t know about that. But he’ll find out. I know he
will. <br>
BARBARA: But why does he keep you here? <br>
VICKI: They, they killed all the crew. We, when we landed, we made
contact here. Everyone on board was invited to a grand sort of meeting.
I couldn’t go, I was ill, a fever or something. I stayed here that
night. I remember waking up. A thunderstorm, I thought, but it was an
explosion. Bennett. Bennett dragged himself back. I was ill for days, I
didn’t know about it til later. I came around and…found Bennett. He
can’t walk. We just wait, and then Koquillion. <br>

kill you. <br>

is totally alien to people on this planet. <br>
IAN: Oh, well, people change, Doctor. New leader, different set of
circumstances. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, my dear Chesterton, no. All the more reason for
people on this planet to hate death and destruction. My dear boy, when
I was here before, the, what, the total population amounted to, a
handle of people. Merely a hundred. <br>

VICKI: Is he, is he dead? <br>
BARBARA: No, it must have been the strain of walking out here made him
collapse. How do you feel? <br>
VICKI: This is Barbara, Bennett. <br>
BENNETT: Koquillion told me of your arrival. He’s killed your friends. <br>
BARBARA: I don’t think so. I’m sure they’re all right. <br>
BENNETT: Koquillion doesn’t make mistakes. <br>
BARBARA: Well he did about me. You know, the next time he visits us, we
might be able to surprise him. He doesn’t know I’m here, does he, so we
could set a trap and overpower him. <br>

BENNETT: No! <br>
BARBARA: Well, surely it’s worth a try? You wouldn’t be any worse off
than you are now. <br>
BENNETT: The Mir rescue ship is due to arrive, or hasn’t Vicki told you
that. We have to sit still, do as he says. Maybe we’ll have a chance of
escaping, get back to Earth. <br>
VICKI: We could still go. <br>
BENNETT: You’re just a child, you don’t know what you’re talking about.
We get rid of Koquillion, we gain nothing. If the plan fails, he kills
us. <br>

to try to do. You know, we’re not going to ruin things for you. <br>

away so he took a job on the planet Astra. <br>

travels through time. <br>

anything then. <br>

BENNETT: Are you finished? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I had hoped that you would continue. This elaborate plan
must have been conceived for some reason. What, hmm? <br>
BENNETT: To save my life. I killed a crewmember on the spaceship to
Astra. I was arrested. The ship crashed. My crime hadn’t been radioed
to Earth. I knew if I could get rid of the other crewmembers. <br>
DOCTOR: Get rid of the other crewmembers and blame their deaths on the
Dido people, hmm? <br>

grand meeting. It was simple. I just arranged an explosive, using the
ships armaments. The whole thing went up. All the inhabitants, the
crew, the whole race. <br>

insane. <br>

Earth, she’d support my story. I dressed up as Koquillion to show her
how terrible the people here were. <br>

people for Koquillion to kill, that’s all. <br>

broken in the fall. The Doctor and Bennett fight, with Bennett easily
overpowering him and starting to choke him when two people dressed in
