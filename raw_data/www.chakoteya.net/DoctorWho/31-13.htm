still burning brightly.<br>
Night. The red pinwheel turns in the breeze in the garden. Upstairs, a
little red haired girl is saying her prayers.) <br>
AMELIA: Dear Santa. Thank you for the dolls and pencils and the fish.
It's Easter now, so I hope I don't wake you, but, honest, it is an
emergency. There's a crack in my wall. Aunt Sharon says it's just an
ordinary crack, but I know it's not, because at night there's voices.
So, please, please, could you send someone to fix it, or a policeman,
or <br>

AMELIA: The moon. <br>
CHRISTINE: And what else? <br>
AMELIA: Just the dark. <br>
CHRISTINE: But no stars. If there were stars up there, we'd be able to
see them, wouldn't we? Amelia, look at me. You know this is all just a
story, don't you? You know there's no such thing as stars. </font></p>

Throughout history, people have talked about seeing stars in the sky.
God knows where it comes from. <br>
SHARON [OC]: I just don't want her growing up and joining one of those
Star Cults. I don't trust that Richard Dawkins. <br>
(Christine and Sharon walk across the hallway from the kitchen to the
living room. Someone in a red fez puts a leaflet through the door.
Amelia runs down to get it. It is titled The Anomaly, and features the
Pandorica at the National Museum. Someone has written on it in red ink
- Come along, Pond.)

there is a post-it note on the Pandorica, saying Stick around, Pond.) <br>
SHARON [OC]: Amelia! <br>

SHARON: Amelia? Amelia? <br>
(Closing time.) <br>
SHARON; Amelia! <br>
TANNOY: Amelia Pond, please go to the reception, please. Your aunt is
waiting for you there. Amelia Pond, please go to reception. <br>
(Later still, Amelia creeps out from the Penguin display, knocking some
over.) <br>
AMELIA: Sorry. <br>

hand on the Pandorica and starts to open. Amelia backs away. The person
inside speaks to her.) <br>

lying across his lap, Pieta-style.) <br>
RORY: So the universe ended. You missed that, in 102 AD. I suppose this
means you and I never get born at all. Twice, in my case. You would
have laughed at that. Please laugh. The Doctor said the universe was
huge and ridiculous, and sometimes there were miracles. I could do with
a ridiculous miracle about now. <br>
(The Doctor pops in from thin air, wearing a red fez and carrying a
mop.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rory! Listen, she's not dead. Well, she is dead, but it's not
the end of the world. Well, it is the end of the world. Actually, it's
the end of the universe. Oh, no. Hang on. <br>
(The Doctor vanishes again.) <br>
RORY: Doctor? Doctor! <br>
(He reappears, without the mop.) <br>
DOCTOR: You need to get me out of the Pandorica. <br>
RORY: But you're not in the Pandorica. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. Well, I'm not now, but I was back then. Well, back
now from your point of view, which is back then from my point of view.
Time travel, you can't keep it straight in your head. It's easy to open
from the outside. Just point and press. <br>
(The Doctor gives Rory his sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now go. <br>
(The Doctor vanishes and returns.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, and when you're done, leave my screwdriver in her top
pocket. Good luck. <br>
(And vanishes again.) <br>
RORY: What do you mean? Done what?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Rory opens the Pandorica with the sonic
screwdriver. The Doctor is released from the chair.) <br>
DOCTOR: How did you do that? <br>
RORY: You gave me this. <br>
(The Doctor takes his screwdriver from his own pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, I didn't. <br>
RORY: You did. Look at it. <br>
(The Doctor touches his screwdriver to Rory's. They spark.) <br>
DOCTOR: Temporal energy. Same screwdriver at different points in its
own time stream. Which means it was me who gave it to you. Me from the
future. I've got a future. That's nice. That's not. <br>
(The Daleks are fossilised.) <br>
RORY: Yeah. What are they? <br>
(Everyone who was in the chamber when the universe ended has been
fossilised.) <br>
DOCTOR: History has collapsed. Whole races have been deleted from
existence. These are just like after-images. Echoes. Fossils in time.
The footprints of the never-were. <br>
RORY: Er, what does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Total event collapse. The universe literally never happened. <br>
RORY: So, how can we be here? What's keeping us safe? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Eye of the storm, that's all. We're just the last
light to go out. Amy. Where's Amy?

DOCTOR: Oh, Rory. <br>
RORY: Doctor, what am I? <br>
DOCTOR: You're a Nestene duplicate. A lump of plastic with delusions of
humanity. <br>
RORY: But I'm Rory now. Whatever was happening, it's stopped. I'm Rory.
<br>
DOCTOR: That's software talking. <br>
RORY: Can you help her? Is there anything you can do? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, probably, if I had the time. <br>
RORY: The time? <br>
DOCTOR: All of creation has just been wiped from the sky. Do you know
how many lives now never happened? All the people who never lived? Your
girlfriend isn't more important than the whole universe. <br>
(Rory punches the Doctor.) <br>
RORY: She is to me! <br>
DOCTOR: Welcome back, Rory Williams! Sorry. Had to be sure. Hell of a
gun-arm you're packing there. Right, we need to get her downstairs. And
take that look off your plastic face. You're getting married in the
morning.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor places Amy in the Pandorica.) <br>
RORY: So you've got a plan, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Bit of a plan, yeah. Memories are more powerful than you think,
and Amy Pond is not an ordinary girl. Grew up with a time crack in her
wall. The universe pouring through her dreams every night. The Nestenes
took a memory print of her and got a bit more than they bargained for,
like you. Not just your face, but your heart and your soul. <br>
(The Doctor mind-melds with Amy.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm leaving her a message for when she wakes up, so she knows
what's happening. <br>
(The Doctor seals Amy inside the Pandorica.) <br>
RORY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm saving her. This box is the ultimate prison. You can't even
escape by dying. It forces you to stay alive. <br>
RORY: But she's already dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, she's mostly dead. The Pandorica can stasis-lock her that
way. Now, all it needs is a scan of her living DNA and it'll restore
her. <br>
RORY: Where's it going to get that? <br>
DOCTOR: In about two thousand years.

AMELIA: Are you all right? Who are you? <br>
AMY: I'm fine. I'm supposed to rest. Got to rest, the Doctor says. <br>
AMELIA: What doctor? <br>
(Amy taps her head.) <br>
DOCTOR: He's in here. Left a message in my head like I'm an
answerphone. Where am I? Hang on. National Museum, right? I was here
once when I was a little <br>
(And the penny drops.) <br>
AMY: Yeah, complicated. Let's see, it's what, 1996? <br>
AMELIA: Who are you? <br>
AMY: It's a long story. Oh. A very long story. <br>

back to Rome under armed guard. 420AD Raided by the Franks. 1120AD
Prized possession of the Knights Templar. 1231 Donated to the Vatican.)

her bag and straps it to his wrist.) <br>
RORY: She's going to be in that box for two thousand years? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, but we're taking a shortcut. River's vortex manipulator.
Rubbish way to time travel, but the universe is tiny now. We'll be
fine. <br>
RORY: So hang on. The future's still there, then. Our world. <br>
DOCTOR: A version of it. Not quite the one you know. Earth alone in the
sky. Let's go and have a look. You put your hand there. Don't worry.
Should be safe. <br>
RORY: That's not what I'm worried about. <br>
DOCTOR: She'll be fine. Nothing can get into this box. <br>
RORY: Well, you got in there. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's only one of me. I counted. <br>
RORY: This box needs a guard. I killed the last one. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Rory, no. Don't even think about it. <br>
RORY: She'll be all alone. <br>
DOCTOR: She won't feel it. <br>
RORY: You bet she won't. <br>
DOCTOR: Two thousand years, Rory. You won't even sleep. you'd be
conscious every second. It would drive you mad. <br>
RORY: Will she be safer if I stay? Look me in the eye and tell me she
wouldn't be safer. <br>
DOCTOR: Rory, you <br>
RORY: Answer me! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Obviously. <br>
RORY: Then how could I leave her? <br>
DOCTOR: Why do you have to be so human? <br>
RORY: Because right now, I'm not. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me. This is the last bit of advice you're going to
get in a very long time. You're living plastic, but you're not
immortal. I have no idea how long you'll last. And you're not
indestructible. Stay away from heat and radio signals when they come
along. You can't heal, or repair yourself. Any damage is permanent. So,
for God's sake, however bored you get, stay out of <br>

NARRATOR [OC]: According to legend, wherever the Pandorica was taken,
throughout its long history, the Centurion would be there, guarding it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(An audio visual presentation of the history of the
Pandorica on a nearby screen.) <br>
NARRATOR [OC]: He appears as an iconic image in the artwork of many
cultures, and there are several documented accounts of his appearances,
and his warnings to the many who attempted to open the box before its
time. His last recorded appearance was during the London blitz in 1941.
The warehouse where the Pandorica was stored was destroyed by
incendiary bombs, but the box itself was found the next morning, a safe
distance from the blaze. There are eyewitness accounts from the night
of the fire of a figure in Roman dress, carrying the box from the
flames. Since then, there have been no sightings of the Lone Centurion,
and many have speculated that if he ever existed, he perished in the
fires of that night, performing one last act of devotion to the box he
had pledged to protect for nearly two thousand years. <br>

DALEK: Exterminate! <br>

from a dummy.) <br>
AMY: What are we doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we are running into a dead end, where I'll have a
brilliant plan, that basically involves not being in one. <br>
MAN: What's going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Get out of here. Go! Just run! <br>
DALEK: Drop the device! <br>
(The man only has a torch.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not a weapon. Scan it. It's not a weapon, and you don't
have the power to waste. <br>
DALEK: Scans indicate intruder unarmed. <br>

DOCTOR: Yeah, shut up, because we've got to go. Come on. <br>
RORY: I waited. Two thousand years I waited for you. <br>
AMY: No, still shut up. <br>
DOCTOR: And break. And breathe. Well, somebody didn't get out much for
two thousand years. <br>
AMELIA: I'm thirsty. Can I get a drink? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all mouths today, isn't it. The light. The light from

twelve minutes. That's good. <br>

to do about Amelia? <br>

DOCTOR: There is no Amelia. From now on, there never was. History is
still collapsing. <br>
AMY: But how can I still be here if she's not? <br>
DOCTOR: You're an anomaly. We all are. We're all just hanging on at the
eye of the storm. But the eye is closing, and if we don't do something
fast, reality will never have happened. Today, just dying is a result.

with it. But why would it do that? How? <br>

event collapse means that every star in the universe never happened.
Not one single one of them ever shone. So, if all the stars that ever
were are gone, then what is that? <br>

DOCTOR: The perfect prison. And inside it, perfectly preserved, a few
billion atoms of the universe as it was. In theory, you could
extrapolate the whole universe from a single one of them, like, like
cloning a body from a single cell. And we've got the bumper family
pack. <br>
RORY: No, no. Too fast. I'm not getting it. <br>
DOCTOR: The box contains a memory of the universe, and the light
transmits the memory, and that's how we're going to do it. <br>
AMY: Do what? <br>
DOCTOR: Relight the fire. Reboot the universe. Come on! <br>
RIVER: Doctor, you're being completely ridiculous. The Pandorica
partially restored one Dalek. If it can't even reboot a single life
form properly, how's it reboot the whole of reality? <br>
DOCTOR: What if we give it a moment of infinite power? What if we can
transmit the light from the Pandorica to every particle of space and
time simultaneously? <br>
RIVER: Well, that would be lovely, dear, but we can't, because it's
completely impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah no, you see, it's not. It's almost completely impossible.
One spark is all we need. <br>
RIVER: For what? <br>
DOCTOR: Big Bang Two! Now listen. <br>
(The Dalek shoots the Doctor.) <br>
DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! <br>
RORY: Get back. River, get back now! <br>
DALEK: Exterminate! <br>
(Rory shoots at the Dalek and it powers down again.) <br>
RIVER: Doctor? Doctor, it's me, River. Can you hear me? What is it?
What do you need? <br>
(The Doctor activates the vortex manipulator and vanishes.) <br>
RIVER: Where did he go? Damn it, he could be anywhere. <br>
AMY: He went downstairs, twelve minutes ago. <br>
RIVER: Show me! <br>
AMY: River, he died. <br>
DALEK: Systems restoring. You will be exterminated. <br>
RORY: We've got to move. That thing's coming back to life. <br>
RIVER: You go to the Doctor. I'll be right with you. <br>
(Amy and Rory leave.) <br>
DALEK: You will be exterminated! <br>
RIVER: Not yet. Your systems are still restoring, which means your
shield density is compromised. One Alpha Mezon burst through your
eyestalk would kill you stone dead. <br>
DALEK: Records indicate you will show mercy. You are an associate of
the Doctor's. <br>
RIVER: I'm River Song. Check your records again. <br>
DALEK: Mercy. <br>
RIVER: Say it again. <br>
DALEK: Mercy! <br>
RIVER: One more time. <br>
DALEK: Mercy!

AMY: But he was dead. <br>
RIVER: Who told you that? <br>
AMY: He did. <br>
RIVER: Rule one. The Doctor lies. <br>

AMY: Doctor! <br>
RORY: Why did he tell us he was dead? <br>
AMY: We were a diversion. As long as the Dalek was chasing us, he could
work down here. <br>
RIVER: Doctor, can you hear me? What were you doing? <br>
(The light from the Tardis is getting brighter.) <br>
RORY: What's happening? <br>
RIVER: Reality's collapsing. It's speeding up. Look at this room. <br>
AMY: Where'd everything go? <br>
RIVER: History's being erased. Time's running out. Doctor, what were
you doing? Tell us. Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Big Bang Two. <br>
RORY: The Big Bang. That's the beginning of the universe, right? <br>
AMY: What, and Big Bang Two is the bang that brings us back? Is that
what you mean? <br>
RIVER: Oh. <br>
AMY: What? <br>
RIVER: The Tardis is still burning. It's exploding at every point in
history. If you threw the Pandorica into the explosion, right into the
heart of the fire. <br>
AMY: Then what? <br>
RIVER: Then let there be light. The light from the Pandorica would
explode everywhere at once, just like he said. <br>
AMY: That would work? That would bring everything back? <br>
RIVER: A restoration field powered by an exploding Tardis, happening at
every moment in history. Oh, that's brilliant. It might even work. He's
wired the vortex manipulator to the rest of the box. <br>
AMY: Why? <br>
RIVER: So he can take it with him. He's going to fly the Pandorica into
the heart of the explosion. <br>
(A short time later.) <br>
RORY: Are you okay? <br>
AMY: Are you? <br>
RORY: No. <br>
AMY: Well, shut up then! <br>
RIVER: Amy, he wants to talk to you. <br>
AMY: So, what happens here? Big Bang Two? What happens to us? <br>
RIVER: We all wake up where we ought to be. None of this ever happens
and we don't remember it. <br>
AMY: River, tell me he comes back, too. <br>
RIVER: The Doctor will be the heart of the explosion. <br>
AMY: So? <br>
RIVER: So all the cracks in time will close, but he'll be on the wrong
side, trapped in the never-space, the void between the worlds. All
memory of him will be purged from the universe. He will never have been
born. Now, please. He wants to talk to you before he goes. <br>
AMY: Not to you? <br>
RIVER: He doesn't really know me yet. Now he never will. <br>
(Amy goes to the Pandorica. The Doctor is very weak.) <br>
AMY: Hi. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy Pond. The girl who waited all night in your garden. Was it
worth it? <br>
AMY: Shut up. Of course it was. <br>
DOCTOR: You asked me why I was taking you with me and I said, no
reason. I was lying. <br>
AMY: It's not important. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's the most important thing left in the universe. It's
why I'm doing this. Amy, your house was too big. That big, empty house,
and just you. <br>
AMY: And Aunt Sharon. <br>
DOCTOR: Where were your mum and dad? Where was everybody who lived in
that big house? <br>
AMY: I lost my Mum and Dad. <br>
DOCTOR: How? What happened to them? Where did they go? <br>
AMY: I, I don't <br>
DOCTOR: It's okay, it's okay. Don't panic, it's not your fault. <br>
AMY: I don't even remember. <br>
DOCTOR: There was a crack in time in the wall of your bedroom, and it's
been eating away at your life for a long time now. Amy Pond, all alone.
The girl who didn't make sense. How could I resist? <br>
AMY: How could I just forget? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing is ever forgotten. Not really. But you have to try. <br>
RIVER: Doctor! It's speeding up! <br>
(Amy puts the Doctor's sonic screwdriver in his pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: There's going to be a very big bang. Big Bang Two. Try and
remember your family and they'll be there. <br>
AMY: How can I remember them if they never existed? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you're special. That crack in your wall, all that time,
the universe pouring into your head. You brought Rory back. You can
bring them back, too. You just remember and they'll be there. <br>
AMY: You won't. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll have your family back. You won't need your imaginary
friend any more. Ha! Amy Pond crying over me, eh? Guess what? <br>
AMY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Gotcha. <br>
(The Pandorica closes.) <br>
RIVER: Back! Get back! <br>
(The Pandorica takes off. River gets a text message.) <br>
RIVER: It's from the Doctor. <br>
AMY: What does it say? <br>
RIVER: Geronimo. <br>
(The Pandorica reaches the Tardis. There is another explosion then
everything reverses back to the start of the previous episode.)

somehow. Silly me. Silly old Doctor. When you wake up, you'll have a
mum and dad, and you won't even remember me. Well, you'll remember me a
little. I'll be a story in your head. But that's okay. We're all
stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh? Because it was, you
know. It was the best. The daft old man who stole a magic box and ran
away. Did I ever tell you that I stole it? Well, I borrowed it. I was
always going to take it back. Oh, that box. Amy, you'll dream about
that box. It'll never leave you. Big and little at the same time. Brand
new and ancient, and the bluest blue ever. And the times we had, eh?
Would have had. Never had. In your dreams, they'll still be there. The
Doctor and Amy Pond, and the days that never came. The cracks are
closing. But they can't close properly until I'm on the other side. I
don't belong here any more. I think I'll skip the rest of the rewind. I
hate repeats. Live well. Love Rory. Bye bye, Pond. <br>

up, looks around and goes back to sleep while the stars twinkle in the

you home, too. Raggedy man, I remember you, and you are late for my
wedding! <br>

I happened to be wearing this old thing. Hello, everyone. I'm Amy's
imaginary friend. But I came anyway. <br>

DOCTOR: Amelia, from now on I shall be leaving the kissing duties to
