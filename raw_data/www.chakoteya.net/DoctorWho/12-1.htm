SARAH: Look, Brigadier, look. I think it's started. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, well, here we go again. <br>
(The brown haired man starts to wake and mumble in the background. The
Brigadier picks up the telephone.)&nbsp;<br>
BRIGADIER: Get me the medical officer. Lieutenant Sullivan? Emergency.
Come to the lab at once, please. <br>
DOCTOR: Human history. <br>
BRIGADIER: What's he talking about? <br>
SARAH: It's something that happened when we first met. <br>
DOCTOR: I tell you, Brigadier, there's nothing to worry about. The
brontosaurus is large and placid. <br>
(A naval officer enters. Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0551722/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Ian Marter</a>.) <br>
HARRY: This the patient, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: And stupid. If the square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of
the square on the other two sides, why is a mouse when it spins? Never
did know the answer to that one. <br>
(Benton enters. He has lost his sergeant's stripes and gained a crown.)
<br>
BENTON: Excuse me, sir. The daily reports. <br>
HARRY: Take him to the sick bay. I'll make a proper examination there. <br>
BENTON: What's happening, sir? Who's <br>
BRIGADIER: That, Mister Benton, is the Doctor. <br>
BENTON: You mean he's done it again? He's changed? <br>
BRIGADIER: Apparently. Saw it happen this time. Lieutenant Sullivan? <br>
HARRY: Yes, sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm placing the Doctor in your personal charge. He's to have
your full attention. <br>
HARRY: Right-o, sir. <br>
(Harry and his assistants leave with the Doctor and Sarah.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Right, anything urgent, Mister Benton. <br>
BENTON: No, sir. Just routine. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, everything seems pretty quiet. </font></p>

as it approaches a sentry on duty. He fires his pistol at it before
being attacked. Then the thing uses it's metal claws to rip through the
barrier and its padlocks. On it goes, into the centre, beeping quietly
to itself. Guard dogs bark, then whimper and run before it smashes its
way into the building. Once inside, it goes down a corridor, rips open
a strongroom vault door and removes a paper labelled Top Secret.) <br>
BRIGADIER [OC]: A complete set of plans for the new disintegrator gun. </font></p>

BRIGADIER: No one saw them. Probably enemy agents. Small commando
squad. They found heavy vehicle tracks. You realise of course, Miss
Smith, all this is top secret? <br>
SARAH: Then why are you telling me? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, because I. Because there's no one else I can tell. <br>
SARAH: The Doctor's still unconscious? Oh, he'll be all right. I know
he will. <br>
BRIGADIER: He used to drive me mad, but I miss having him about. You
know, he'd have been interested in this robbery. There's some very
strange features. <br>
SARAH: Actually I want to ask a favour of you. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, of course. <br>
SARAH: Er, you know Think Tank, the frontiers of science research
place? All the latest of everything under one roof? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, what about it? <br>
SARAH: Well, now and again, exceptionally favoured journalists are
allowed to visit it, and, well, for ages now I have been dying to <br>
BRIGADIER: You want me to get you a visitor's pass. <br>
SARAH: Oh, please. <br>
BRIGADIER: Nothing simpler. Come to my office and I'll fix it straight
away. <br>
SARAH: And could I see the Doctor before I go? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, of course. <br>
SARAH: You're sure you've got the right man to look after him? <br>
BRIGADIER: Young Sullivan? Oh, he's a very fine chap. First class
doctor. <br>
SARAH: Seems a bit old fashioned. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: Nothing wrong with that, Miss Smith.
You may not have noticed, but I'm a bit old fashioned myself. <br>
(Around the corner, a figure in nightshirt is trying to put on a jacket
whilst carrying a pair of boots. He hides as the couple pass by.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, nonsense, Brigadier. You're a swinger. <br>

DOCTOR: Ah! <br>
(But it is locked.) <br>
DOCTOR: Key. Key, key, key, key. Key, key. <br>
(He searches the jacket pockets. Nothing. Then he shakes the boots and
there it is.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Obvious place. <br>
HARRY: There you are. Now come along, Doctor, you're supposed to be in
the sick bay. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I? Don't you mean the infirmary? <br>
HARRY: No, I do not mean the infirmary. I mean the sick bay. You're not
fit yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Not fit? I'm the Doctor. <br>
HARRY: No, Doctor, I'm the doctor and I say that you're not fit. <br>
DOCTOR: You may be a doctor, but I'm the Doctor. The definite article,
you might say. <br>
HARRY: Look here, Doctor. You're not fit <br>
DOCTOR: Not fit? Not fit? Of course I'm fit. All systems go! <br>
(The Doctor karate chops a handy brick in half then does some vigorous
running on the spot.) <br>
HARRY: I say. Well, look <br>
(The Doctor takes Harry's stethoscope and holds it to his chest. Harry
listens. Then the other side.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hearts beat? <br>
HARRY: I say, I don't think that can be right. <br>
DOCTOR: Both a bit fast, are they? <br>
HARRY: Well, I <br>
DOCTOR: Still, must be patient. A new body's like a new house. It takes
a little bit of time to settle in. <br>
(The Doctor sees himself in a mirror.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. As for the physiognomy. Well, nothing's perfect. Have to
take the rough with the smooth. Mind you, I think the nose is a
definite improvement. As for the ears, well, I'm not too sure. Tell me
quite frankly, what do you say to the ears? <br>
HARRY: Well, I really don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course you don't. Why should you? You're a busy man.
You don't want to stand here burbling about my ears. Neither here nor
there. I can't waste any more time. Things to do, places to go. I'm a
busy man too, you know. Thank you for a most interesting conversation.
Must be on my way. <br>
HARRY: There is absolutely no question of you leaving, Doctor. Now, you
go back to the infirmary, I mean the sick bay, get into bed and stay
there until I say that you can get up. <br>
DOCTOR: How can I prove my point? <br>
(The Doctor finds a long piece of rope and holds an end in each hand.
He stands close to Harry.) <br>
HARRY: I think I ought to warn you, Doctor, that there's grave danger
of myocardial infarction, not to speak of pulmonary embolism. Yes, I
should, I should <br>
(The Doctor starts skipping with the rope, forcing Harry to join in.) <br>
DOCTOR: Mother, mother, I feel sick. Send for the doctor quick, quick,
quick. Mother, dear, shall I die? Yes, my darling, by and by. One two
three four. </font></p>

air.) <br>
SARAH: What are you doing down there? Where's the Doctor? <br>
HARRY: Tied me up and hung me up in here like a pair of old boots. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, where is he? <br>
(The Tardis starts up.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah, too late. <br>
SARAH: No! No, Doctor, wait! Doctor, listen. Please, it's Sarah! <br>
(The Tardis stops and the door opens.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. Come to see me off, have you? Well, I hate goodbyes.
I'll just slip away quietly. <br>
SARAH: No, no, Doctor. You can't go. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't? Can't? There's no such word as can't. <br>
(He slams the Tardis door in her face. After a moment, it opens again.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
SARAH: Well, because you're not. Well, because the Brigadier needs you.
Don't you, Brigadier? <br>
BRIGADIER: What? Oh, yes, of course. Depending on you. <br>
DOCTOR: What for? <br>
SARAH: Er, well, there's been this robbery, hasn't there, Brigadier.
Some kind of secret weapon. <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah, yes. Very serious business. <br>
SARAH: And I mean, you are still UNIT's scientific advisor. Remember?
Well, you can't go rushing off and leave them in the lurch. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't I? Goodbye. <br>
(The Tardis door shuts again.) <br>
HARRY: Er, excuse me, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: What? <br>
HARRY: Could you oblige? <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, yes. <br>
(The Brigadier unties Harry's feet as the Doctor looks out of the
Tardis again.) <br>
HARRY: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. <br>
BRIGADIER: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't me met somewhere before? No, don't tell me. Alexander
the Great? No. Hannibal? No. Ah. Brigadier. Brigadier Alistair Gordon
Lethbridge Stewart. How are you? <br>
BRIGADIER: Very well, thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: And Sarah Jane. Well now, isn't this nice? What was that you
said about a secret weapon? </font></p>

electrified fence. The security man in the stores quickly bars the door
and goes for the telephone, but before he can utter a word the whatever
it is has battered its way in, throttled him and ripped the telephone
from the wall. Then it goes to the racks of parts on the wall and
carefully selects the items it needs according to the beeps it is
receiving.) </font></p>

DOCTOR: Is something wrong? <br>
BRIGADIER: You've changed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not again. <br>
BRIGADIER: No, I didn't mean your face, I meant your clothes. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you like them? <br>
BRIGADIER: UNIT is supposed to be a security organisation. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you think I might attract attention? <br>
BRIGADIER: It's just possible. <br>
DOCTOR: One moment. <br>
(The Doctor goes back into the Tardis, then re-emerges as the King of
Hearts from a pack of playing cards.) <br>
DOCTOR: No? No. <br>
(Next costume - a pierrot. Then -) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, how about this? <br>
(Shirt, trousers, jacket, very long striped scarf and floppy hat.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Much better, Doctor. Now, if you've quite finished with your
wardrobe? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll try again if you like. <br>
BRIGADIER: No, let's settle for that, please. Now, Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Time we were off. <br>
BRIGADIER: Off? <br>
DOCTOR: To visit the scene of the crime. <br>

cultivate a sense of urgency. </font></p>

for all the good it was, it might just. Doctor? Doctor, will you please
pay attention. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but I am, I assure you. Look. <br>
(The Doctor has a yellow dandelion head in his hand.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I have every respect for your concern for ecology,
but really, one squashed dandelion. <br>
DOCTOR: Not just squashed, flattened. Almost pulverised. <br>
(The Doctor blows the dust into the Brigadier's face.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, how did it get like that? <br>
HARRY: Well, I suppose it was stepped on. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. And according to my estimation of the resistance to
pressure of vegetable fibre, it was stepped on by something that
weighed a quarter of a ton. </font></p>

valuable and top secret stuff behind. Here's a list of all they
actually took. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Just what you'd need for the control circuitry of one
powerful, compact technological device. A disintegrator gun, for
instance? <br>

outside. <br>

Director. <br>
HILDA: I hadn't expected male chauvinist attitudes from you, Miss
Smith. <br>

<br>
BRIGADIER: So, what are we looking for? <br>
DOCTOR: Something that brushes chains and electric fences like cobwebs.
Something intelligent, that takes only what it needs and leaves the
rest. Something that kills a man as casually as it crushes a dandelion.
<br>
BRIGADIER: And what sort of something? Is it human? <br>
DOCTOR: I doubt it, Brigadier. More than human, perhaps. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, whatever it is, how do we find it? <br>
DOCTOR: By locking the next stable door in good time. <br>
BRIGADIER: Huh? <br>
DOCTOR: It, whatever it may be, has stolen the plans for the new
disintegrator gun. It has also in its possession the necessary control
circuitry. <br>
HARRY: You think it wants to build the gun? <br>
DOCTOR: Why else steal the plans and the circuitry? Now, assuming I'm
right, and I invariably am, what is the third vital ingredient? <br>
BRIGADIER: The focusing generator. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly, Brigadier. Exactly. <br>

BRIGADIER: Greyhound Leader to Trap One. Over. <br>
BENTON [OC]: Trap One. We read you, Greyhound Leader. Over. <br>
BRIGADIER: Mister Benton, red priority. Emmett's Electronics, a
smallish factory in Essex. I want blanket security. Every available
man. Air cover as well. I'll meet you there in one hour. By then I want
that place better guarded than Fort Knox. Out. <br>

JELLICOE: As you've seen, we do most of what's called frontiers of
science research here. <br>
HILDA: As soon as our work reaches a practical stage, it's handed over
to someone. Someone with more resources and a bigger budget. <br>
JELLICOE: Usually the government. <br>
SARAH: Well, like the new disintegrator gun? You pioneered the research
on that, didn't you? <br>
HILDA: Well, yes. I'm not sure you should know about that. <br>

SARAH: J P Kettlewell, Robotics Section. He left some time ago, didn't
he? That's right, there was all that fuss about it in the press. <br>
HILDA: Yes, indeed there was. As you probably heard, he turned against
conventional science altogether. <br>
JELLICOE: He spends his time on alternative technology, whatever that
may mean. <br>
SARAH: What's through there? <br>
JELLICOE: His store room. Professor Kettlewell left some valuable
equipment. We're keeping it until he deigns to come collect it. <br>

BENTON: Come along, come along. Get that wire across. Move! <br>
BRIGADIER [OC]: Armed patrols have every inch of the perimeter under
observation. Helicopter patrols overhead. Inside that factory is a
vault. Not a safe, Doctor, a vault. There's a sentry outside it. Inside
the vault there's a casket. A metal casket containing every focusing
generator in the place. Believe me, Doctor, the place is impregnable. <br>
DOCTOR: Never cared much for the word impregnable. Sounds a bit too
much like unsinkable. <br>
HARRY: What's wrong with unsinkable? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing, as the iceberg said to the Titanic. <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Glug, glug, glug. <br>

cordon. Protected from every side and from above. <br>
DOCTOR: That still leaves one direction. <br>
(The Doctor points downwards. Right on cue, a drill bit comes up
through the vault floor. The sentry on duty on top of the entrance to
the bunker goes down and opens the door to see where the noise is
coming from. He opens fire with his machine gun. The Brigadier, Benton,
the Doctor and Harry run towards the noise.) </font></p>

you came to me. <br>
SARAH: Well, I'm not too sure myself, to be honest. I just felt
something in the air at Think Tank. <br>
KETTLEWELL: Yes, I severed all connection with that establishment some
time ago, when I became completely disillusioned at the direction all
our research was taking. The road to ruination. I'm now devoting my
life to alternative energy technologies. <br>
SARAH: Solar cells, heat from windmills, that sort of thing? <br>
KETTLEWELL: Yes, as you say, that sort of thing. It's a rich and
complex field, and I have a great deal of work to do. <br>

carrying on your work in robotics? <br>

space again? <br>
DOCTOR: Why should some alien life form invade Earth just to steal a
new weapon? If they were that advanced, they'd have weapons of their
own. Ha. Rather a splendid paradox, eh, Brigadier? <br>

DOCTOR: The only ones who could do it wouldn't need to. <br>

and the generators? An enemy government would have those resources
itself. <br>

DOCTOR: I think your enemies are home grown, Brigadier. People with
access to technological information and a most unusual weapon. A weapon
that walks and thinks. In a word, anthropomorphic. <br>

anything else about these people? <br>

here. You abused that privilege to pry into matters on the secret list.
<br>
SARAH: You're right, of course. I'm sorry. <br>
JELLICOE: Not a bit of it. You were simply following the instincts of a

HILDA: A practical demonstration. You must admit it was a convincing
one. <br>
JELLICOE: Prime directive, you see. It's built into the robot's very
being that it must serve humanity and never harm it. <br>
SARAH: That was a cruel thing to do. <br>
HILDA: Cruel? It isn't human, you know. It has no feelings. <br>
SARAH: Oh, it's got a brain, hasn't it? It walks and talks like us. How
can you be sure it doesn't have feelings too? Are you all right? <br>
ROBOT: My functioning is unimpaired. <br>
SARAH: But you were distressed. I saw that. <br>
ROBOT: Conflict with my prime directive causes imbalance in my neural
circuits. <br>
SARAH: I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea. <br>
ROBOT: The imbalance has been corrected. It is not logical that you
should feel sorrow. <br>
HILDA: Really, Miss Smith, this is absurd. I think you must be the sort
of girl that gives motor cars pet names. <br>

about your behaviour here, you might find yourself in a very difficult

discovered here, and I'll keep quiet about how you discovered it. <br>

BENTON: Miss Smith, get down! <br>
SARAH: No! No, don't shoot! <br>
(But Benton does shoot, and so do the soldiers by the broken door. The
robot heads for them, and smashes its way out into the yard, bullets
bouncing from its metal body. Benton joins his men, and they shoot at
it from all angles. The robot knocks down one soldier and continues to
march away. Benson goes back inside.) <br>
BENTON: Is he okay, Miss? <br>
SARAH: Yes, yes, I think so. <br>
BENTON: We just couldn't stop it. <br>
SARAH: Oh, well, what did you have to start shooting for? He wouldn't
have harmed you. <br>
BENTON: You could have fooled me. It was trying to kill the Doctor,
wasn't it? <br>
SARAH: Yes, but that was because. Well, it doesn't matter, and it
wasn't your fault, I suppose. You did your best. <br>

KETTLEWELL: The robot came to find me last night. It was in terrible
distress. They'd just forced it to commit another crime. <br>
SARAH: Yes, yes, I know. <br>
KETTLEWELL: They altered his circuitry so as to overcome his prime
directive. They succeeded, but at fearful cost. <br>
SARAH: He became unbalanced. <br>
KETTLEWELL: Yes. Then Miss Winters and Jellicoe came along while I was
waiting for the Doctor. They programmed the robot to kill him. I
protested, but <br>
SARAH: Shush. Never mind, you're safe now. <br>
KETTLEWELL: You know, when I think of that robot's potential. I
invented the metal he's made of, you know. I called it living metal. <br>
(Benton enters with a tray.) <br>
KETTLEWELL: It actually has the capacity to grow like a living
organism. <br>
SARAH: It's quite big enough for me now, thank you. <br>
KETTLEWELL: That's how I came to make my other discovery, you know.
It's the metallic equivalent of a virus. It breaks down metal into
easily recyclable form. You can see what that means, can't you? It
means that we shall be able to get rid of all the metallic waste that
pollutes this planet. <br>
BENTON: Professor? <br>

KETTLEWELL: Thank you. <br>

KETTLEWELL: What's that doing there? <br>
SARAH: Oh, I went to see them. Rather unpleasant. <br>
KETTLEWELL: Scientific Reform Society. Oh yes, just before I left the
Think Tank, they persuaded me to join it. I remember I went along to
one of the meetings once. Very odd bunch. Didn't go there again. <br>
SARAH: Well now, there's a meeting there tonight. Suppose you were to
turn up, Professor, would they let you in? <br>
KETTLEWELL: Very probably. I think I've still got my membership card
about me somewhere. <br>
SARAH: And if I came along too, plus my camera and tape recorder, you
could smuggle me in and we could get the goods on them for the
Brigadier. <br>
BENTON: Hey, now, hang on, you two. <br>
SARAH: What do you say, Professor, shall we try it? Of course, it could
be dangerous. <br>
KETTLEWELL: If there's anything I can do to help to defeat those
people. <br>
BENTON: But the Brigadier will go spare. So will the Doctor. <br>
SARAH: Well, one's away and the other's asleep. <br>
BENTON: Well, I'll go and wake the Doctor and see what he says. <br>
SARAH: Don't you dare. He had a nasty knock on the head and he needs to
rest. <br>
BENTON: In that case, Miss, it's just not on. I'm sorry. <br>
SARAH: Oh! Mister Benton, are we members of UNIT? <br>
BENTON: Well, no, of course not. <br>

BRIGADIER: No, Mister Benton, I did not. <br>

DOCTOR: Then you must act without it. I know what they're up to now.
Worked it all out while I was having my little nap. It's all tied up
with the information stolen from that poor fellow Chambers. He must
have been the guardian of some kind of ultimate threat. <br>
BRIGADIER: How on Earth <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know exactly what it is, just the kind of thing it has
to be. Well, am I right? <br>
BRIGADIER: A few months ago, the superpowers, Russia, America and
China, decided upon a plan to ensure peace. All three powers have
hidden atomic missile sites. All three agreed to give details of those
sites plus full operational instructions to another neutral country. In
the event of trouble, that country could publish everyone's secrets and
so cool things down. Well, naturally enough, the only country that
could be trusted with such a role was Great Britain. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, naturally, I mean, the rest were all foreigners. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, exactly. The destructor codes for firing these
missiles were kept in Chambers' house in a special Dynastreem safe. The
robot killed Chambers, blasted the safe open with a disintegrator gun
and took the codes. <br>
BENTON: So what can they do with them now that they've got them? <br>
BRIGADIER: They could set off every atomic missile in the world, Mister
Benton. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and start a nuclear holocaust that would turn this little
planet of yours into a radioactive cinder suspended in space. <br>
BENTON: You mean he could use the information to blackmail the world?
Do things our way or we light the blue touch paper. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid so. <br>
BRIGADIER: We think they've been using this Scientific Reform Society
as a front, Doctor, and I've just heard from Mister Benton here that
Miss Smith and Professor Kettlewell have just gone off to try to get
into one of their meetings. <br>

Outside the Meeting Hall building, UNIT soldiers back away as Hilda
hustles Sarah down the steps, followed by Kettlewell. When the robot
appears, they start firing. Jellicoe cowers behind the robot as
Kettlewell and Hilda get Sarah into the cab of a horse box. Once Short

the barricade. The rest of the SRS members dash out of the rear door,

up from his console.) <br>
KETTLEWELL: Can't. I won't. <br>
(He picks up Jellicoe's chair and is about to smash a computer.) <br>
JELLICOE: Don't attempt to stop it! <br>
KETTLEWELL: I can't do it! I won't do it! <br>
JELLICOE: Let it run! <br>
(Kettlewell backs away from Jellicoe's gun. Harry runs in and tackles
Jellicoe, disarming him before knocking him out.) <br>
KETTLEWELL: Thank heavens you've come. <br>
SARAH: Can you cancel what you've been doing? <br>
KETTLEWELL: There's no time. I'll punch in the hold signal. <br>
(The countdown stops at 58.) <br>
HARRY: Right, so now open the main doors. We're going outside. <br>
KETTLEWELL: Yes. <br>

DOCTOR: Sarah. <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>

SARAH: Look, please, don't shoot. We're no danger to you. <br>
ROBOT: You must go. The soldiers must go. <br>
SARAH: You've got to let him in there. <br>
ROBOT: They are enemies of the human race. <br>
SARAH: No, they're the enemies in there. They want to start an atomic
war. Kill millions of people. <br>
(The robot struggles with the conflict.) <br>
ROBOT: You must go or I will kill. I must kill you. I must destroy you.
<br>
KETTLEWELL: No, no, he was only telling <br>
(The robot fires the disintegrator as Kettlewell steps forward. The
robot becomes distraught.) <br>
ROBOT: I have killed the one who created me. <br>
(The robot crashes to the ground.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now's our chance. <br>
(The Doctor, Harry, Sarah and the Brigadier go into the bunker. Benton
takes the disintegrator gun from the robot and follows them.) </font></p>

floor, and sees UNIT coming along a corridor on a CCTV monitor. She
picks up a folder, sits at Kettlewell's console and restarts the
countdown.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Get away from that keyboard. <br>
HILDA: You won't shoot, Brigadier. <br>
(Sarah picks up Jellicoe's gun.) <br>
SARAH: Maybe he won't, but I will. Move away! <br>
HILDA: Why not? It's finished. The firing instructions have gone out. <br>
BRIGADIER: I can still get the major powers to use their fail-safe
procedures. <br>
HILDA: Too late, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: Cancel the destructor codes! <br>
HILDA: When that reaches zero, the missiles will be fired, and no one
can send the cancel codes in time.) <br>
(27, 26, 25, the Doctor runs to the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: She may be right, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: Benton, get them both out of here. <br>
BENTON: Miss Winters. <br>
(Benton grabs Jellicoe.) <br>
BENTON: Move! <br>
(Benton, Hilda and Jellicoe leave. 17, 16) <br>
DOCTOR: The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very
sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing
speed, even if you order them to kill you. So if you do happen to
change your mind, it's very difficult to stop them obeying the original
order, but <br>

DOCTOR: Not impossible. <br>
HARRY: Congratulations, Doctor. <br>
SARAH: You've done it! <br>
BENTON: Well done, Doctor. <br>
(Sarah remembers something, and leaves.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Right, that's over. Now for a little mopping up. <br>
BENTON: Right, sir. <br>
(In a bunker corridor, Sarah nearly walks into the robot.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: Vanished? How can they have vanished? <br>
BENTON: We were all pretty busy inside, sir, mopping up the rest of
that Think Tank lot. We noticed the robot was gone when we came out and
everyone assumed that someone else had got it. <br>
DOCTOR: And Sarah? <br>
BENTON: Well, we thought, we thought she'd gone home. <br>
DOCTOR: Gone home? You mean not one of you connected the disappearance
of Sarah with the vanishing of the robot? <br>
BRIGADIER: You're sure there is a connection? <br>
DOCTOR: I think so. Don't you? <br>
HARRY: Why Sarah? <br>
DOCTOR: The robot killed Kettlewell, remember, the man who created it.
It must be in a state of tremendous emotional shock. What more natural
than it should turn to the one person who ever showed it kindness? <br>
BRIGADIER: Hmm. Keep looking, Benton. <br>
BENTON: Right, sir. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SARAH: Honestly, they're bound to find us. <br>
ROBOT: Anyone who finds us will be destroyed. <br>
SARAH: Why? What's the point of more killing? I keep telling you, it's
all over. What can you do alone? <br>
ROBOT: I can bring about the destruction of humanity. But do not fear,
Sarah. You alone will be saved. <br>
(The robot turns and beeps a lot.) <br>
ROBOT: The bunker is cleared. Come. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: Well? <br>
BENTON: Still nothing, sir. We're spreading the search radius wider and
wider, but the bigger the area to cover the harder it gets. <br>
DOCTOR: There is just one teeny weeny little thing. <br>
BRIGADIER: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Something else you haven't thought of. What are we going to do
with it when we find it? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes. You know, just once I'd like to meet an alien menace
that wasn't immune to bullets. <br>
BENTON: Excuse me, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Hmm? <br>
BENTON: Well, when Professor Kettlewell was here talking to Miss Smith,
he said the robot was made of some kind of living metal. He even said
it could grow. <br>
DOCTOR: Did he now. <br>
BENTON: Yes, and he went on about some kind of metal virus. Something
that attacked the living metal. <br>
DOCTOR: The same way that disease attacks animal tissue. <br>
BENTON: Well, something like that. Anyway, I just wondered. If we could
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
BENTON: Oh, I'm sorry. It was probably a daft idea anyway. <br>
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Mister Benton. Wonderful! Brigadier, I must get to
Kettlewell's place at once. You find the robot. <br>
BRIGADIER: You'd better go with him. <br>
HARRY: Right, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Keep in R/T contact! </font></p>

SARAH: No! Don't hurt him. Let him go. He's not important enough. (to
the soldier) Don't shoot. Just leave now. Don't worry about me, just
go. <br>
(The soldier gets past the robot and flees.) <br>

then turns to the countdown. It resets it to 300 and starts it running
again.) <br>
SARAH: No! No! Why? Why? <br>
ROBOT: I destroyed Kettlewell. I must see that his plan does not fail. <br>
SARAH: But he changed his mind. He wouldn't want you to continue. <br>
ROBOT: Mankind is not worthy to survive. Once it is destroyed, I shall
build more machines like myself. Machines do not lie. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Why didn't that silly man write up his experiments properly? <br>
(The Doctor starts mixing the contents of various test tubes.) <br>
BRIGADIER [OC]: Doctor, this is the Brigadier. Can you hear me? <br>
HARRY: (into R/T) This is Lieutenant Sullivan, sir. The Doctor's rather
busy at the moment. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell him to stop pestering me. I've found a metal virus and I'm
trying to prepare an active solution, but he must give me time. </font></p>

Is the computer terminal in the bunker still active? <br>
BRIGADIER [OC]: Far as I know. I don't suppose anyone thought to <br>
DOCTOR: Can you switch off the electricity supply? <br>
BRIGADIER [OC]: Yes. No, no, it's on a special sealed circuit. <br>
DOCTOR: Then warn all the major powers. The emergency is not over. They
must operate full fail-safe procedures at once. </font></p>

monitor flashes up Fail Safe Countdown Aborted.) <br>
SARAH: You see? They've operated the fail-safe mechanism. Give up now.
Please! <br>
ROBOT: Humanity must be destroyed. It is evil, corrupt. <br>
SARAH: But you can't take on the whole world. Don't you understand?
They'll destroy you! <br>
ROBOT: Do not fear. I cannot be destroyed. <br>

ROBOT: Come. </font></p>

HARRY: This any good? <br>
(The Doctor tests it with a magnet, then loads a pipette with his
bubbling orange solution and squirts some onto the bar.) <br>

BRIGADIER: No one's to open fire. She may find a chance to get clear. <br>
ROBOT: Stay here. <br>
(Sarah nods. The robot turns towards UNIT.) <br>
BENTON: It's going to attack, sir. Shall we pull back? <br>
(The Brigadier spots something in the back of the Land Rover.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Of course. The very thing. <br>
(He picks up the disintegrator gun.) <br>
BRIGADIER: I think just for once, we're not going to need the Doctor. <br>
(The Brigadier fires the gun at the robot. It staggers and glows, then
starts to grow! <br>
BENTON: (silent) What? <br>
(Sarah makes a dash for it but trips, and becomes Fay Wray to the
robot's King Kong as it gently puts a claw around her waist and lifts
her up.) <br>

Tank. She grabs for a chimney stack.) <br>
ROBOT: You will be safe. See how I deal with our enemies. <br>
BRIGADIER: She's out of the line of fire. Launch your grenades. <br>
BENTON: Smith, Hampton, get down here quickly with the launcher. Fire! <br>
(The one-sided battle starts as Bessie hurtles along the road. The
robot picks up two soldiers and drops them into the car park.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Right, pull back! <br>
(Another soldier gets stomped on as the rest return to the Land Rovers.
Huts are crushed underfoot by the robot as it follows the fleeing UNIT
vehicles and men through the complex. Then the Doctor and Harry arrive
in Bessie.) <br>
HARRY: Curiouser and curiouser. <br>
DOCTOR: Said Alice. <br>
HARRY: Exactly. <br>
(The robot starts to return to Sarah, walking into electricity cables
and swatting the irritants aside. The Doctor joins UNIT.) <br>
DOCTOR: I see our little problem seems to have grown. Where's Sarah? <br>
BENTON: She's safe enough, Doc. <br>
BRIGADIER: I gave it a blast with the disintegrator gun. <br>
BENTON: It left her up on the roof. <br>
DOCTOR: Really, Brigadier, you should be more careful with your little
toys. You've given it just the infusion of energy it needed. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, I've sent for the artillery, and the RAF are on their
way. <br>
DOCTOR: I hope that won't be necessary. <br>
BRIGADIER: What on Earth is that? <br>
(That is a bucket bubbling over with orange gunk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Another piece of brilliance from the late Professor Kettlewell,
and one that will solve our problem, I hope. Drive on, Harry. <br>
HARRY: Right, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Wish me luck, Brigadier. <br>
(Bessie drives off.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Now just a moment, Doctor! <br>
SARAH [OC]: Hey! Hey, get me down! <br>
BRIGADIER: Don't just stand there, Benton. Go and help Miss Smith. <br>
BENTON: Right, sir. <br>
(The robot stands and watches as the little yellow car zooms up and
past him. The Doctor throws the contents of the bucket over its ankles
and shins. The orange quickly spreads down to its feet and then upwards
as Bessie returns to the UNIT vehicles.) <br>
BRIGADIER: What was that stuff? <br>
DOCTOR: Some of Kettlewell's metal virus in an active solution. <br>
BRIGADIER: Will it work now the thing's that size? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, even faster, I hope. Look. <br>
(The robot is a vivid orange and starting to gurgle as it shrinks.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's thrown the growth mechanism into reverse. <br>
HARRY: Oh, well done, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Harry. <br>
(The robot returns to its normal size, then falls backwards onto the
ground. The Brigadier, the Doctor and Harry walk forward to inspect it.
The robot is about four feet long now.) <br>
BRIGADIER: I'll have it taken away. Broken up, just in case. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, Brigadier, that won't be necessary. Look. <br>

enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah? Sarah? <br>
(He takes a paper bag out of his pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Would you like a jelly baby? I had to do it, you know. <br>
SARAH: Yes, yes, I know. It was insane and it did terrible things, but,
but at first, it was so human. <br>
DOCTOR: It was a wonderful creature, capable of great good, and great
evil. Yes, I think you could say it was human. You know, what you need
is a change. How about a little trip in a Tardis. I'm just off. <br>
SARAH: Wait, you can't just go. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? It's a free cosmos. <br>
SARAH: The Brigadier <br>
DOCTOR: The Brigadier wants me to address the Cabinet, have lunch at
Downing Street, dinner at the Palace, and write seventeen reports in
triplicate. Well, I won't do it. I won't, I won't, I won't. <br>
(The Doctor hits a hapless brick sitting on the workbench. That hurts.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Why should I? <br>
SARAH: Doctor, you're being childish. <br>
DOCTOR: Well of course I am. There's no point in being grown up if you
can't be childish sometimes. Are you coming? <br>
(Sarah takes a jelly baby and they both laugh. The Doctor unlocks the
Tardis as Harry enters.) <br>
HARRY: Hello. Well, what are you two up to now, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: We're just going on a little trip. Would you like a jelly baby?

HARRY: (taking one) Little trip? What, in that old police box? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, as a matter of fact, in that old police box. <br>
(The Doctor snatches back the sweet.) <br>
HARRY: Oh, come along now, Doctor. We're both reasonable men. Now, we
both know that police boxes don't go careering around all over the
place. <br>
DOCTOR: Do we? <br>
HARRY: Of course we do. The whole idea's absurd. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it? You wouldn't like to step inside a moment? Just to
demonstrate that it is all an illusion. <br>
HARRY: Well, if you think it'll do any good. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, it'll make me feel a lot better. <br>
SARAH: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: In you go. <br>

HARRY [OC]: Oh, I say! <br>

well, I'll tell them you'll be a little late. </font> </p>
