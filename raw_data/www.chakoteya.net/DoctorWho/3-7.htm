The law’s right behind you, <br>
And it won’t take long. <br>
So come, you coyotes <br>
And howl at the moon, <br>

(Three cowboys ride into the small Arizona mining town of Tombstone.
Just off Main Street lies the OK Corral, as proclaimed by a large
bullet-ridden sign above the entrance. One of the cowboys shoots at
it.) <br>
IKE: Now why for did you do a fool thing like that? Save your bullets
for Holliday, boy. <br>
BILLY: I ain’t scared of Holliday! <br>
PHINEAS: Hear that, Ike? Brother Billy ain’t scared. <br>
IKE: Nobody says you was scared, boy. Our brother Reuben, now he wasn’t
scared of him, but that didn’t stop Holliday fillin’ him full of holes!

PHINEAS: Where do we all meet up with Seth? <br>
IKE: The Last Chance Saloon. <br>

towards Main Street, the tall blue shape of a 1960s London police box,
80 years and 5000 miles out of place, materialises at the back of a
cluttered livery stable to one side of the corral. The door opens and
the Doctor comes out, holding a handkerchief to his mouth.) <br>
STEVEN: What's the matter Doctor? <br>
(Steven and Dodo follow him from the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I've got the most ghastly toothache. It's paralysing pain. <br>
STEVEN: it serves you right for eating that sweet. Well, aren't there
any painkillers on the Tardis? <br>
DODO: If there's anything I can get you? <br>
DOCTOR: No, my dear, thank you, no. I shall have to have it out. We've
got to find a dentist. <br>
STEVEN: Where are we? <br>
(Dodo spots the sign over the gate outside.) <br>
STEVEN: It must be in the past sometime. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're very observant, dear boy, but where? <br>
STEVEN: How would I know? <br>
DODO: I know. <br>
STEVEN: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, use your eyes, dear boy. Good heavens. <br>
(Steven looks out of the stable door.) <br>
STEVEN: Tombstone! The OK. Well, that sounds like <br>
DODO: The Wild West! <br>
STEVEN: It can't be, can it? <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? Fat chance I've got of finding a dentist in the middle

DOCTOR: Oh please, must you? <br>

HARPER: You took your sweet time gettin' here Clanton. Well, Doc
Holliday arrived here before noon! <br>
IKE: Rode out as soon as ever I got your wire. Anyways, Holliday'll
keep for a drink or three, I'd say. <br>
BILLY: Sure enough will. Barman! A bottle and three more glasses. Fast!
<br>
IKE: You boys know this guy? <br>
PHINEAS: Yeah, snake-eyes Harper. <br>
HARPER: I don't like being called snake-eyes. Last fellow called me
that got himself an extra hole in the head! <br>
IKE: Sure, Seth, sure. We're friends, ain't we? Ain't we in this
together? <br>
HARPER: Well I'm in it. You're all together on the outside just lookin'
in. <br>
PHINEAS: Now that ain't so. We're backing you. You make your play and
we gun 'im down. Easy as skinnin' summer fries. <br>

time dressed for the part. Steven with white stetson and fringed shirt
is tripping over his spurs and attempting to twirl a pair of
pearl-handled six-guns.) <br>
DODO: How do we look? <br>
(Dodo's Mexican ensemble is topped off with a black felt hat.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious. Absolutely absurd. <br>
DODO: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Why you have to dress yourselves up like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594291/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Tom Mix</a> I can't
imagine. You're asking for trouble. Why can't you wear inconspicuous
clothes like I do? <br>
DODO: Oh, what about me? Don't you like it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that hat is certainly wrong with it. <br>
DODO: Oh, it's not supposed to be. That's for you. <br>
DOCTOR: For me, my dear child? Oh, that's very thoughtful of you, thank
you. Yes, at least it'll keep the rain off. Yes, it's most suitable.
Ow! <br>
STEVEN: Buffalo Bill to the lions. <br>
DOCTOR: What was that? <br>
STEVEN: Nothin' pardner! I was just a-practising mah quick-draw! <br>
(Steven attempts a draw, but ends up dropping his gun.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, do be careful, dear boy. And remember that belongs to my
favourite collection! <br>
STEVEN: Now see here, stranger. I reckon you don't know who I is!
Deadeye Steve. The fastest, meanest gun in the West. <br>
DODO: I think you're smashing. <br>
(Someone shoots the gun out of Steven's hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, what on Earth? Are you? And who might you be, sir? <br>
WYATT: You wanna find out, try movin' fast! Now get over! <br>
(The shooter is a tall mustachioed man with the silver star of a city
Marshal pinned to his breast.) <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know who you are or what right you have <br>
WYATT: Marshall of Tombstone's my right and Wyatt Earp's my name. <br>
DODO: Wyatt Earp! <br>
WYATT: Oh, something wrong, ma'am? <br>
DODO: Oh no, it's just that, well, I always wanted to meet you and here
we are face to face. <br>
WYATT: Well, the Lord sure do move in mysterious ways, ma'am. Now maybe
you'll all come along to Sheriff's office? <br>
STEVEN: What on Earth for? <br>
WYATT: So as that you can identify yourself in decent law abiding
manner. <br>
STEVEN: Ah. No, you see, I'm, er, I'm not really a gunman. I was just <br>
WYATT: Huh. You did kinda make that look obvious didn't ya, boy? That's
why I'm doin' you a favour taking you on in. <br>
STEVEN: Why? <br>
WYATT: Cos of the Clantons are in town, and, boy, that's mighty
unhealthy for a stranger that calls himself the fastest gun in town.

hit 'im. Hey, Billy? Billy! <br>
(The youngest Clanton is leaning casually against the bar whilst the
others sit at the table drinking whiskey and playing cards.) <br>
BILLY: Yeah. Yeah, it'd be a real shame, I'd like for him to know. I'd
like him to know us for Reuben's brothers. <br>
HARPER: Look, you don't know Holliday. You want him to come lookin' for
us, and you ain't even seen 'im? You're crazy. <br>
PHINEAS: Well, where's he at now? <br>
HARPER: How should I know where he's at? I just know he pulled in here
this mornin'. <br>
PHINEAS: Well, let's get this straight. You mean you don't know where
Holliday? You never met Holliday either? <br>
HARPER: Look, I don't have to meet 'im, I've seen pictures. I've had
him described to me. Dapper little fellow with a black buck's back
coat, gambler's fancy vest. <br>
BILLY: So fine, so we'll know him when we find him. So, how do we find
him? <br>
HARPER: We don't have to find him. Ain't you heard o' Holliday's
gamblin' n' drinkin'? Now where's the one place in town he's liable to
get both? <br>
IKE: Right here. <br>
HARPER: Yeah. So we just sit here and wait for him, 'n that's all we
gotta do. <br>

interest. She turns to the barman.) <br>

having the pleasure of attending you shortly in my dental saloon. Are
you accompanying me Miss Kathleen? <br>

as Wyatt Earp appears with the Doctor, Steven and Dodo.) <br>

WYATT: Howdy, Bat. Everythin' quiet in town? <br>
MASTERSON: Everything excepting that rattlesnake friend of yours
Holliday blew in this mornin'. Who're your friends, Wyatt? <br>
WYATT: Well I, er <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, quite, quite so. Allow me, sir, to introduce Miss Dodo
Dupont, wizard of the ivory keys, and er Steven Regret, tenor. And
lastly sir, your humble servant Doctor Caligari. <br>
MASTERSON: Doctor Who? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, quite right. I've just been satisfying the Sheriff here
that we are a humble troupe of travelling players. Unfortunately, sir,
at the moment between engagements. MASTERSON: Well if I was you I'd
keep a-travellin'. There ain't no theatre in Tombstone. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, is that so? Oh, well, that's no matter, no. You see my
prime purpose for visiting your city, sir, was to avail myself the
services of a dentist. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
WYATT: Well, then, Doc Holliday's your man. WYATT: Where is the Doc,
Bat? <br>

thatta way, friend. You can't miss it. <br>

hardwood molar hangs ostentatiously over the door.) <br>
STEVEN: Look I don't know why you wanted to say it in the first place.
Steven Regret? What kind of a name's that for a singer anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear young man, can't you sing a little? <br>
STEVEN: Well yes, a little, but why say it at all? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I had to find some sort of suitable cover. After all, you
can't walk into the middle of a Western town and say that you've come
from outer space. Good gracious me, we'd all be arrested on a vagrancy
charge. <br>
STEVEN: And what about our little wizard of the keys? Miss Dupont, can
you play? <br>
DODO: I'll have a bash. <br>
DOCTOR: There will be no necessity to have a bash, because tomorrow
morning we're going to leave Tombstone and we should be back in the
Tardis in for lunch. You know, I don't think that that is a very subtle
form of advertising, do you? Yes, come to think of it, my dear, you
know I think my toothache's better. Yes, I don't think it's going to be
at all necessary <br>
STEVEN: Come on, Doctor. Straight into the surgery. I'll go to the
hotel and book the rooms. <br>
DODO: Please, Doctor. You'll feel so much better afterwards. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I only wish I shared your confidence, my dear. However, I
suppose I'll meet you both back in the hotel lounge. Oh! There it goes
again. <br>

clean and tidy. Yet the Doctor wanders around the primitive operating
chair and eyes the basic equipment in dismay. He's about to leave but
winces as his troublesome tooth throbs once more. At the sound of
voices from the back room, the time traveller opens the connecting door
to find a young woman sitting on the dentist's lap, the two engaged in
a passionate embrace and obviously not expecting visitors.) <br>
KATE: I gotta get me that <br>
DOCTOR: I, er, forgive me, sir. I, er, I should have knocked. <br>

treatment. Down you go. That's the philosophy of toothache. Now, you go

real still, I'll er <br>

shooter. <br>

know what you're doing. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, well, I'm very glad to know you Mister Harper. Yes, I
suppose you've brought a message from my friends. <br>
HARPER: Well, a kind of a message, Doc. The boys are waitin' for you at
the saloon. They'd sure like to buy you a drink. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well, that's very sociable of them, but unfortunately I
don't touch alcohol. <br>
HARPER: That's not what I heard, Doc, but we'll play it your way. <br>

come looking for you, okay? <br>

KATE: Now, Doc. <br>
HOLLIDAY: Nah, nah, nah, nah. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a very charming man, that man Mister Harper. Did you
hear what he said? <br>
HOLLIDAY: Yeah, that's just Western hospitality, you know. But if
you'll forgive my saying so, you ain't dressed right for a party. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear man, I fail to see that my clothes have <br>
HOLLIDAY: Ah now, it ain't exactly your clothes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what is it then? <br>
HOLLIDAY: You ain't wearin' a gun. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I should hope not. I certainly disapprove of violence. <br>
HOLLIDAY: Now you can borrow mine. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. <br>
HOLLIDAY: Now, come along here. You just stand up here. Now you put the
holster on him. <br>
DOCTOR: I insist. <br>
HOLLIDAY: Now my gun here has my name printed on it, from way down
Alabama, where my father was a Colonel in the army. So you can return
that to me when you leave Tombstone, which no doubt you will. Now,
there you are sir. <br>

HOLLIDAY: You'll find a way to repay me. Goodbye, and good luck. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
HOLLIDAY: Goodbye and good luck. <br>

the gun by way of explanation. But Kate is quick to take advantage of
the confusion and produces her own weapon.) <br>

like it or not. <br>
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous, gentleman. Can you not uphold the law
without using firearms? <br>
WYATT: Well, old friend, now I've got Doc Holliday back, why, you can
hand in your badge any time you want to, Pop. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good heavens, what a relief. Here you are, Bat, there's
your badge and there is your wretched weapon! <br>
HOLLIDAY: Wyatt, how you proposin' to handle this little Clanton
matter? <br>
WYATT: Well, just walk right up there and face 'em. <br>
HOLLIDAY: You reckon old Pa Clanton will play it that simple? <br>
VIRGIL: Well, they'll reckon they're four to two. <br>
HOLLIDAY: One of them four is Johnny Ringo. I ain't lining up for no
square dance. I'm gonna play this my way. <br>
WYATT: So what's your way? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, what is your way, Doctor Holliday?

the bar.) <br>
DODO: Isn't it time you went to bed, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, how can I possibly sleep my dear, knowing that Steven is
mixed up with all this? <br>
DODO: I'm quite sure that Steven can take care of himself. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but I'm not just worrying about Steven, my dear. What
about this man Mister Werp? Supposing he gets killed? Who is going to
uphold law and order in this territory? Why they couldn't let Masterson
handle the affair I don't know, with a posse of deputies, and at the
end of it let the Clantons get a fair trial. <br>
MASTERSON: Proud to hear you say so, Doctor. If'n you feel that way
there's something you can do. I've tried all I know to talk Wyatt out
of this and he won't listen. I'm asking you to go talk to the Clantons.
Seems like that's our only chance. <br>
DOCTOR: Me? But my dear Sheriff, I should have thought you were the one
to convince <br>
MASTERSON: No, no, they know me for a friend of Wyatt's. But if'n you
go to 'em wearing your badge, say you'll guarantee them a fair trial,
it might just persuade 'em. Me, I'd rather face trial than Wyatt,
Virgil and Holliday together. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. <br>
DODO: And you might be able to help Steven. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, quite so, my dear. That thought had passed through my
head, yes. Well, Mister Sheriff, if you need my assistance I certainly
will go along and talk to them. <br>
MASTERSON: Good. <br>
(Masterson once more pins the badge to the Doctor's coat.) <br>
MASTERSON: Now, it's only about two hours to sun-up. You'd better get
started right now.

PA: When the shootin's over we'll have this town in the palm of our

STEVEN: There's still Morgan Earp. <br>

going be behind the Earps. <br>
PA: One more yap outta you, Regret, you're dead, boy. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah tut, tut, tut, tut, tut. If you are alluding to the presence
of Mister Ringo, I can assure you, sir, that that also has been
anticipated. They're quite ready for him. <br>
PA: Okay, supposing they are? There's still only two of them against
four. <br>
DOCTOR: You have been sadly misinformed. Doctor Holliday is there also.
<br>
PA: What? Kate, you said Holliday was in New Mexico. <br>
KATE: I blush with shame, Mister Clanton, indeed I do. That was a dad

Boys of gun fighting fame, <br>
Where the Earps and the Clantons, <br>
They played out their game. <br>
IKE: Here they come, boys. <br>
(The Earps appear at the corral entrance.) <br>
IKE: Now! <br>
(The Clantons open fire but the Earps stand their ground. <br>
IKE: Scatter! <br>

Earps come into range they start to return fire.) <br>
WYATT: Take the side. <br>
(Doc Holliday is advancing slowly along the side of the street unaware
that Ringo is just a few yards behind him.) <br>
DODO: Doc, look out! <br>
(Holliday spins round at Dodo's warning, but Ringo grabs the girl and
smiles broadly at his rival.) <br>
RINGO: Well, if it ain't Doc Holliday. Who invited you, Doc? <br>
HOLLIDAY: You did, Ringo. It seemed kinda seemly to show up. <br>
RINGO: Throw down your gun, or the girl gets it. <br>
(Doc throws his revolver aside and it skims across the sidewalk, coming
to rest in the road. Ringo's eyes follow it, and continuing to hold
Dodo tightly as a shield, he moves to pick it up. But as the gunman
stoops, Dodo catches him off balance and shoves him hard. He slips,
landing on his back in the dirt. Dodo runs for shelter as Doc calmly
takes out his Derringer and shoots.) <br>
HOLLIDAY: I'm sorry Johnny. <br>
(The Clantons and the Earps continue to trade bullets as Holliday
stands over the dying Ringo.) <br>
HOLLIDAY: I thought you'd do better than that, Mister Ringo. <br>
RINGO: I will, next time. <br>

HOLLIDAY: Ah now Missy, you sure do perplex me. Go on now, you get the
hell outta here. <br>
DODO: I'm sorry, Doc. I was only trying to help. <br>
HOLLIDAY: You try to help me any more, you'll be the death of me. Go
on! <br>

HOLLIDAY: Ringo was here. <br>
WYATT: And? <br>
HOLLIDAY: He ain't no more. <br>
(Billy Clanton is firing from beneath a wagon.) <br>
BILLY: Phin! I'm gonna get Doc Holliday! <br>
(Under cover of a volley of shots from Ike, Billy crawls forward to
take new sanctuary under the porch of a building, from where he
continues to fire on Holliday's position. But he's edgy, and his
bullets go wide. Doc stands and takes careful aim. Blam, blam, blam.
Billy looks up in surprise and pain before collapsing. He struggles to
sit up, unable to grip his gun properly. Doc steps forward and looks
Billy straight in the eye before firing a last shot. Billy's gun
discharges harmlessly into the ground as he dies. Phineas looks on
appalled, then breaks cover and runs around the back of the wagon,
emerging at the other end in plain sight of Virgil Earp. His shirt
stained crimson, Phineas staggers against the wagon, clutching at a
wheel for support before finally sinking under a barrage of shots from
the Earps. The last Clanton standing, Ike runs up some stairs and takes
aim at Holliday as he peers around the corner. He pulls the trigger but
the chamber is empty and the hammer clicks harmlessly. Doc fires, then
Wyatt and Virgil. Ike tumbles over the handrail and bites the dust.) <br>
BALLAD: They paid their sins <br>
And they lost on the draw. <br>
For the Earps they was faster <br>
And they was the law. <br>
So beware all you cowboys <br>
Who's yearning to sin. <br>
If the Earps is the lawmen <br>
You ain't gonna win.

HOLLIDAY: Masterson ain't. <br>

a 2,000 dollar reward.) <br>
