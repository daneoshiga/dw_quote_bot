<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In a wicker and wood hall, a scantily
leather-clad tribe of people meet to decide the fate of a young woman.)
<br>
CALIB: You are the leader, Andor. It is for you to decide. But there
can be but one punishment for such a heresy. Banishment. <br>
(The leader is sitting on a throne which looks like it has some
high-tech origin.) <br>
ANDOR: What say you, Sole? <br>
SOLE: (old man) You know you should not ask. <br>
ANDOR: Then it is agreed. You must be sent beyond. <br>
TOMAS: No! She's young, she spoke rashly. <br>
LEELA: Don't beg, Tomas. What I said was the truth. <br>
(The tribal shaman, with bald head and metal badge of office around his
neck, steps forward.) <br>
NEEVA: What she said profaned the holy purpose of the tribe of
Sevateem. <br>
LEELA: Holy purpose? To die in another useless attack? <br>
NEEVA: The great god Xoanon demands that she be cast out. He told me
this. <br>
LEELA: Liar! There is no Xoanon. <br>
NEEVA: Blasphemy! <br>
ANDOR: Leela, will you take the test of the Horda? <br>
(Leela shakes her head.) <br>
ANDOR: Will any take it for her? <br>
SOLE: I will. <br>
LEELA: No. You'll be killed too. <br>
SOLE: Be silent, daughter. You have said enough. <br>
ANDOR: Test him. <br>
(Two bare-chested young men take Sole away.) <br>
LEELA: Andor, please, call them back. What I said, I was wrong. Forgive
me, please. Neeva, greatest shaman, Speaker of Law, forgive me, please.
<br>
ANDOR: Be silent, girl. Your father was a warrior. Do not shame him. <br>
(Screams come from off camera. Leela and Tomas both use their right
hands to touch their neck, left shoulder and left hip as a form of
blessing.) <br>
ANDOR: Outcast of the tribe of Sevateem, be gone from us. <br>
NEEVA: Spawn of the evil one, return to your master. <br>
ANDOR: You have until sunrise. If you are still within the boundary
then, you must be thrown to the Horda. <br>
(Leela leaves. The tribal men gather in groups to mutter amongst
themselves, all except Tomas.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Animals call in the night, and a cybermat shaped
thing with a small forked tail slithers along the sandy ground as the
Tardis materialises amongst dead looking trees. The Doctor steps out,
looks around, and speaks to the camera.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think this is not Hyde Park. Could be a nexial discontinuity.
Must remember to overhaul those tracers. Put a knot in my hanky. <br>
(His hanky already has a knot in it.) <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder what that was for. Little look round, Doctor? Why not.
<br>
(Men with crossbows are stalking Leela through what passes for a
forest. She knows this, and hides behind the fattest tree trunk she can
find to get her own crossbow loaded with a dart. One of the hunters
comes into view, and she fires. He falls. She stoops to reload and
another hunter takes aim at her, only to get a dart in the shoulder
blade before he can do so.) <br>
LEELA: Tomas. What are you doing here? <br>
TOMAS: I've come to take you back. <br>
LEELA: You can't. <br>
TOMAS: I saw Neeva send them. We can tell the council. <br>
LEELA: It won't make any difference. Not now. <br>
TOMAS: You can't cross the boundary. <br>
LEELA: They didn't leave me much choice. <br>
TOMAS: There are phantoms in the beyond. <br>
LEELA: Feast fire stories. <br>
TOMAS: Well, there's something there. <br>
LEELA: Then I'll face it. I can take care of myself. <br>
TOMAS: I'll go with you. <br>
LEELA: No. Go back to the tribe. I'm going now. Goodbye, Tomas. Beware
of the devious Calib. One day he'll get so cunning even he won't know
what he's planned. <br>
(Elsewhere, the Doctor is whistling 'Colonel Bogey' as he explores.
Something large growls nearby. Leela hears it too, and is afraid. She
starts to run as lianas move behind her, until she trips and falls at
the Doctor's feet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. Hello, did I startle you? Don't be afraid. I won't hurt
you. <br>
LEELA: The Evil One. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, nobody's perfect, but that's overstating it a little. I'm
the Doctor. What's your name? <br>
LEELA: Leela. <br>
DOCTOR: Leela. A nice name, Leela. I never met anyone called Leela.
Would you like a jelly baby? <br>
LEELA: It's true, then. They say the Evil One eats babies. <br>
DOCTOR: You mustn't believe all they say. No, these are sweets. They're
rather good. Go on, have one. <br>
(He holds out the paper bag to her.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go on. <br>
(Leela takes a black jelly baby and sniffs it, then tears it in half to
eat.) <br>
DOCTOR: Leela. Leela, either you've got four friends with very bad
colds, or we're in danger. Which is it? <br>
LEELA: They're your creatures. <br>
DOCTOR: They are? I wonder if they know that. What are they like? <br>
LEELA: They can't be seen. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
LEELA: They are phantoms. <br>
DOCTOR: Invisible. We've got a chance. <br>
(The Doctor takes what looks like a wind-up alarm clock from his
pocket, except it only has the numbers 0 to 4 on it, anticlockwise.) <br>
LEELA: A magic talisman? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's a clockwork egg timer. To our friends, whatever they
are, the visible spectrum is irrelevant. They're blind. Crudely
speaking, they home in on vibrations. <br>
(The Doctor winds it up and puts it on a large stone nearby. Leela
picks up her crossbow.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Leela <br>
LEELA: They've gone. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush. I want you to do exactly as I say. You and
I are going to walk away from here very slowly and very quietly. And no
matter what happens, you mustn't cry out or make any sudden move. And
above all, you mustn't run until I tell you. Is that clear? <br>
(Leela nods.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Now come on. Come on. <br>
(The Doctor takes Leela's hand and they carefully walk away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Freeze. <br>
LEELA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush! <br>
(Big footprints appear in the sand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now tread carefully. <br>
(The Doctor trips and falls flat on his face in front of the
footprints. The egg timer goes off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Saved by the bell. Come on. Come on. <br>
(Stones near the egg timer go flying in all directions, then the timer
is squished flat.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TOMAS: Calib! Calib, wait. I don't know if you're
interested, but Neeva sent two men in secret to try and kill Leela. <br>
CALIB: I'm interested, Tomas. <br>
TOMAS: They failed. <br>
CALIB: Neeva is making mistakes. <br>
TOMAS: You must call a council meeting and tell them. <br>
CALIB: Tell them what? <br>
TOMAS: That he broke the law. <br>
CALIB: Oh, don't be naive, Tomas. Even if the council believed it,
don't you think Neeva would have an answer? He's the Speaker of Law. <br>
TOMAS: There must be something we can do? <br>
CALIB: There is. You know he's promised us victory in the raid. <br>
TOMAS: What more would you expect? <br>
CALIB: No, he's promised us! He says Xoanon has told him we will win.
You see what that means? <br>
TOMAS: That he will look a fool if we don't. <br>
CALIB: More than that. He's going to look like the charlatan he is.
Then we can move against him and that puppet, Andor. <br>
TOMAS: Many men are going to die, Calib. We should stop the raid! <br>
CALIB: Leela tried. <br>
TOMAS: And she's probably dead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LEELA: Stop, we're safe now. We can rest. The
creatures won't cross the boundary. <br>
DOCTOR: How can you be sure? <br>
LEELA: They never have. You should know that. <br>
DOCTOR: I keep on telling you, I'm not the Evil One. Who was it saved
your life? <br>
LEELA: You did. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Never cross the boundary? You know something?
I'm sure those creatures don't stay on their side of the boundary out
of a sense of fair play. There must be a fence of some kind. <br>
LEELA: A fence? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, a fence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Xoanon's shrine]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (This room is directly behind the meeting hall.
Neeva is relaxing on what looks suspiciously like an acceleration couch
when Tom Baker calls his name.) <br>
XOANON [OC]: Neeva! Neeva! <br>
(Neeva kneels down.) <br>
NEEVA: Speak, lord, for your servant hears. <br>
XOANON [OC]: The girl Leela has returned across the boundary. You have
failed. <br>
NEEVA: O great god Xoanon, I have faithfully done all that you
commanded of me. <br>
XOANON [OC]: You crawling thing, do you presume to argue? <br>
(Neeva grovels.) <br>
NEEVA: No, master. Forgive me. <br>
XOANON [OC]: She and the one who is with her must be destroyed. See
that it is done. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor removes a blue-green rosette plant to
reveal a piece of equipment half buried in the sand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Got it. Low intensity sonic disrupter set in a hundred and
eighty degree spread. Simple but effective. <br>
LEELA: Does that keep away the phantoms? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It gives them a nasty headache if they go too close.
They're probably set at intervals along the whole boundary. <br>
(He puts the plant back.) <br>
DOCTOR: The technology's quite advanced, so you didn't put them there. <br>
LEELA: Xoanon! <br>
(Leela blesses herself again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Xoanon? What's those? <br>
LEELA: He's worshiped by the tribe. <br>
DOCTOR: What, he's a god? <br>
LEELA: Yes. I was cast out for speaking against him. <br>
DOCTOR: Really. <br>
LEELA: It's said he's held captive. <br>
DOCTOR: By whom? <br>
LEELA: By the Evil One and his followers, the Tesh. Maybe there is a
holy purpose. I don't know what to believe anymore. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that sounds healthy anyway, Leela. Never be certain of
anything. It's a sign of weakness. Now, where's this Xoanon held? <br>
LEELA: Within the Black Wall, wherein lies Paradise. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that just religious gobbledygook, or is that an actual
place? <br>
LEELA: There is a Wall. <br>
DOCTOR: Is there. Will you show me? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Meeting hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ANDOR: Why has the game disappeared from the land?
Where is the love of Xoanon for his people? Where is your magic? <br>
NEEVA: Xoanon knows there are those amongst the people who do not wish
to fight. <br>
ANDOR: And so he starves us? <br>
NEEVA: No, but how can he bless people who do not love him? There will
be food for those who brave the Wall in his name. <br>
ANDOR: Men do not fight well on empty stomachs! <br>
(Tomas enters.) <br>
NEEVA: The Wall will be at its weakest soon. Soon you can call the
warriors and I will speak the litany. <br>
ANDOR: Do not delay too long. <br>
(Neeva leaves by the back door. Andor thumps the arm of his 'throne' in
anger.) <br>
ANDOR: Well, Tomas? <br>
TOMAS: There's something I wish to say. <br>
ANDOR: Yes? <br>
TOMAS: You should know that I agreed with Leela about the attack. It's
madness. Many of us will die and we shall achieve nothing. <br>
ANDOR: Nevertheless, we shall attack. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the meeting hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Neeva is eavesdropping.) <br>
ANDOR [OC]: It is the will of Xoanon. <br>
TOMAS [OC]: We only have Neeva's word for that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Meeting hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ANDOR: We must have faith. <br>
TOMAS: In the word of an assassin? He sent men to try and kill Leela,
but perhaps you already knew that. <br>
ANDOR: Watch your tongue, boy! And don't let me hear you speak against
the attack again. We shall strive to free Xoanon from the Tesh, and we
will do it together, as one people. <br>
TOMAS: Yes, Andor. <br>
ANDOR: Come, Tomas <br>
(Andor and Tomas leave by the front door, as Neeva watches from the
back door.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Night is falling again.) <br>
LEELA: Shush. <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
LEELA: I thought I heard something. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: Into cover, quick. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't. Leela? Leela, where are you? <br>
LEELA: Over here. <br>
DOCTOR: What? This is no time to be playing games. <br>
LEELA: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't understand? If they're preparing for a battle,
they're hardly likely to send men on patrol on the off-chance that you
might come back. <br>
(Two crossbow bolts thud into the tree trunk directly in front of the
Doctor. Leela is hiding behind it.) <br>
DOCTOR: On the other hand, I could be wrong about that. <br>
[OC]: Stand still! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. (sotto) Keep down, Leela, and get moving. <br>
LEELA: (sotto) I can't leave you. They'll kill you. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto): Go away. (loud) That was either very good shooting or
very bad. Either way, I wouldn't dream of moving. <br>
(Three men with crossbows come into view.) <br>
WARRIOR: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. Who are you and why are you shooting at me? <br>
WARRIOR: Where is Leela? <br>
DOCTOR: Who? <br>
WARRIOR: Spread out. She must be here somewhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, would you mind if I turned round? I feel a bit silly
talking to this tree. <br>
(The Doctor turns and walks forward, and the warrior blesses himself.) <br>
WARRIOR: The Evil One. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear, you too. Well then, tread softly, gentlemen, or I'll
turn you into toads. <br>
(Leela starts to creep away.) <br>
DOCTOR: That gesture you did. Yes, that's the one. It's presumably to
ward off evil. It's interesting because it's also the sequence for
checking the seals on a Starfall Seven spacesuit. And what makes that
particularly interesting is that you don't know what a Starfall Seven
spacesuit is, do you. <br>
(The Doctor holds a jelly baby under the nose of the red-haired
warrior.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now drop your weapons, or I'll kill him with this deadly jelly
baby. <br>
WARRIOR: Kill him, then. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
WARRIOR: Kill him, then. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't take orders from anyone. <br>
(The Doctor eats the jelly baby.) <br>
DOCTOR: Take me to your leader. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Meeting hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The hall is already full when Andor enters and
goes to his 'throne'. Neeva is parading a piece of tech with four blue
cylinders along the top and two pipes coming out of the sides, whilst
silently muttering his incantations.) <br>
ANDOR: Bring it forth. <br>
(The Doctor is escorted in. He is blindfolded with his own scarf, and
his hands are tied behind his back. His captor unwraps the scarf from
his face.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good evening. I think you're going to be very happy I came here
tonight. <br>
(Leela is using a very large hunting knife to cut through the fabric
that makes up the back wall of Neeva's hut. She climbs through. In the
hall, we see Neeva waving his tech up and down the Doctor's body like a
Native American Medicine man.) <br>
NEEVA: Hi ya, hi ya. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd be careful of that if I were you. It's an ultrabeam
accelerator. <br>
NEEVA: See how it fears the sacred relics of Xoanon. <br>
DOCTOR: If there happens to be a charge in there, you could transform
this whole village into a smoky hole in the ground. <br>
NEEVA: Hear how it threatens us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, look, if you'll just untie my hands, I think I have
an idea of what's going on. I may be able to help. <br>
NEEVA: Hear how it squirms for release. Hey, hi ya. Ah, it cannot
deceive us. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, I can see you're a person of very superior intellect.
(to Andor) Are you the leader of this tribe, or his he? <br>
ANDOR: Bring it closer. <br>
(The Doctor is pushed forward.) <br>
ANDOR: Will you release our god Xoanon? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, gladly, if I was holding him prisoner, but I'm not. <br>
ANDOR: Then you must be destroyed, that we may release him. <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? <br>
(Andor brings his knife up to the Doctor's throat.) <br>
NEEVA: Wait, Andor. Call the warriors together and I will speak the
litany. Then it shall be destroyed before them and they will know that
victory is ours. <br>
ANDOR: Very well. <br>
NEEVA: I will prepare myself. <br>
ANDOR: Guard, give the signal. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't hurry on my account. <br>
(Leela hides as Neeva enters his hut. Outside, someone is striking gong
made of a large square of metal, labelled Survey Team 6.) <br>
ANDOR: I cannot believe it. <br>
DOCTOR: Andor, listen to me. <br>
ANDOR: No. No! <br>
DOCTOR: Andor, please listen to me. I am not the Evil One. I am a
traveller, that's all. Your tribe has obviously been visited by
travellers before. <br>
ANDOR: Before? But that is impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: They're space travellers, Andor. Men from another world. The
whole place is littered with their equipment, their weapons and tools.
Your legend of a captive god is obviously related to them in some way. <br>
ANDOR: Guard it well. <br>
DOCTOR: Andor, please think about what <br>
ANDOR: Its words are evil. <br>
DOCTOR: Andor. <br>
ANDOR: Do not listen to him! <br>
(Andor leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Andor, killing me isn't going to help you. It isn't going to do
me much good either, is it. </font></p>

himself with the remains of spacesuit. The helmet hangs down his back.)

NEEVA: Let the tribe of the Sevateem partake of your strength, Xoanon,

shaman of the Sevateem. Hear my prayer. </font></p>

listens to the litany.) <br>
NEEVA: Our fathers of the tribe of Sevateem were sent forth by God to

ALL: And still we seek. <br>
NEEVA: They searched and found it not. While they searched, the tribe
of Tesh. <br>
ALL: Cursed be the cowards of Tesh. <br>

us. <br>

NEEVA [OC]: And the Evil One raised the Tower of Immolo and the Black
Wall and gave them to the tribe of Tesh. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you do that? <br>
LEELA: Janis thorn. It paralyses, then kills. There's no cure. <br>

means that his room is actually a back room to the meeting hall, and

landed. Here. <br>

DOCTOR: Jabel, do your people have a holy purpose? <br>
JABEL: We serve Xoanon and tend the holy places. We guard his tower
against the savage. We deny the flesh so that our minds may find
communion with Xoanon. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Well, it has a sort of logic. Outside the barrier, physical
courage and strength, inside the barrier, paraphysical achievement and
the sort of psi power you used against Leela. It's an experiment in
eugenics. <br>

round the throat but he jabs a sharp elbow into her stomach. Gentek
moves the Doctor back to the doorway.) <br>
DOCTOR: This isn't necessary. I've got a wonderful idea. <br>
(Finally the Doctor frees himself and bends down, grabbing the guard's
leg and throwing him onto the floor. They wrestle, with the guard
trying to make the Doctor touch the electrified walls, while Leela
tries to get her breath back. Finally the Doctor pushes him off, and he
goes staggering back against the wall to die a jerking death.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why didn't you listen? <br>
LEELA: He acted as though he was possessed. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Xoanon's just warming up. Come on. When he gets desperate
enough he'll destroy everything to get at us. <br>
(The lights return to normal, and Leela carefully picks up the weapon.)

drawers while Leela keeps watch at the doorway.) <br>

DOCTOR: They don't alter their views to fit the facts. They alter the
facts to fit their views, which can be uncomfortable <br>
(He spots Leela's blank face in a mirror.) <br>
DOCTOR: If you happen to be one of the facts that needs altering. <br>
(The Doctor ducks just as Leela fires. She stands still so he quickly
hides behind a stanchion and puts together some of the pieces he took
from the drawers with his sonic screwdriver. Leela moves and points the
weapon at him.) <br>

soon gain entry to the tower. Captain Jabel, what must we do? There is
no time. The savages are attacking! <br>
JABEL: Is that your reason for behaving like a degenerate animal? <br>
GENTEK: Forgive me, I <br>
JABEL: You are an acolyte of the People of Tesh, the chosen of Xoanon.
Would he take into communion with him an unreasoning brute, a mindless
beast? <br>
GENTEK: I accept my fault and seek forgiveness. My mind and flesh which
should be two are one, and the way was hid by blood. <br>
JABEL: The flesh is strong and we are weak. Now, Gentek, make your
report. <br>
GENTEK: (calmly) The savages have attacked the main lock. They
outnumber us. What must we do? <br>
JABEL: Fall back gradually. I will have the heavy duty disrupters set

DOCTOR: Flashing? He's put the atomic generators on overload. He got
desperate sooner than I thought. <br>
LEELA: What does that mean? <br>

build a reverse memory transfer system and wipe my personality print
from its brain. <br>
LEELA: And if you can't do it? <br>

forced to come this way? <br>
GENTEK: Yes, Captain. <br>
JABEL: Good. All that remains is to project a blank wall in front of
the disrupters. As soon as the savages are all in the corridor, we will
demolish them before they even know where the beams are coming from. <br>

my torment. I made my madness reality. <br>
DOCTOR: But you told yourself you were breeding a race of superhumans. <br>
XOANON: Independence, strength, boldness and courage in one tribe.
Self-denial, control, telepathy in the other. <br>

ready to select the best of both. <br>
