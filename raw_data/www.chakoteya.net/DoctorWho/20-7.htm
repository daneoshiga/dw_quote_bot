Who twentieth anniversary story.) <br>
DOCTOR 1: One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until
then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward
in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(On an alien planet, a tall, dark tower rises from
a desolate landscape. A susurration
of voices fills the empty, torch-lit corridors. <br>
Meanwhile, on another planet, Turlough settles down by a ruin to sketch
the peaceful rural landscape. Welcome to Plas Brondanw, Gwynedd.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor runs a cloth over his shiny new
console, all gleaming metal and sharp corners with inset control
panels. Tegan enters from the interior.) <br>
TEGAN: Finished? <br>
DOCTOR 5: Yes. Looks rather splendid, doesn't it? <br>
TEGAN: But will the Tardis work properly? <br>
DOCTOR 5: Of course, once everything's run in. <br>
TEGAN: Didn't you repair anything? <br>
DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tardis is more than a machine, Tegan. It's like a
person. It needs coaxing, persuading, encouraging. <br>
TEGAN: You mean it's just as unreliable. <br>
DOCTOR 5: You have little faith, Tegan. <br>
(The Doctor pulls the door lever, and they fail to open.) <br>
TEGAN: Do you blame me? <br>
(A well aimed thump opens the doors.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Eye of Orion]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis is parked inside the ruins. The Doctor
goes out through an archway to where Turlough is sketching.) <br>
TURLOUGH: It's marvellous here. I feel so calm and relaxed. <br>
DOCTOR 5: It's the high bombardment of positive ions. <br>
TEGAN: It's like Earth after a thunderstorm. <br>
DOCTOR 5: Same cause and reason. <br>
TEGAN: It's beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR 5: For some, the Eye of Orion is the most tranquil place in the
universe. <br>
TEGAN: Can't we stay here? <br>
DOCTOR 5: Why not? For a while. We could do with a rest. <br>
(Somewhere, a gloved hand turns a ball control by an illuminated
pentagon with a model of the tower in the middle. An image of the Dark
Tower appears on a screen, then we go to an enclosed garden where the
First Doctor is taking a stroll. Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0403528/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Richard Hurndall</a>,
who did a magnificent job in the role. Suddenly he sees a conical
object coming at him from the sky. The elderly gentleman tries to run,
but it quickly sweeps him up. The gloved hand picks up a model of him
and places it on one segment of the pentagon. <br>
The Fifth Doctor clutches his chest in sudden pain.) <br>
DOCTOR 5: Ah! <br>
TURLOUGH: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR 5: Just a twinge of cosmic angst. <br>
TEGAN: Cosmic? <br>
DOCTOR 5: As if I'd lost something.

Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart, who is retired and in civilian clothes.) <br>
CRICHTON: Right. <br>
BRIGADIER: Thank you. <br>
CRICHTON: Well, to civilian life. <br>
BRIGADIER: You know, I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to
this reunion. A chance of re-meeting old friends. <br>
CRICHTON: There was one chap we tried to get hold of. What was his
name? Used to be your scientific advisor. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, the Doctor. <br>
CRICHTON: Yes that's right. <br>
BRIGADIER: Wonderful chap. All of them. <br>

Stewart. <br>
CRICHTON [OC]: How did he know he was here? <br>

Doctor does a neat turn resulting in him taking the coat off.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Oh, thank you. Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: Good heavens. Is it you? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, yes. For once, I was able to steer the Tardis. And here
I am. <br>
CRICHTON: It's all right, Sergeant. <br>
SERGEANT: Very good, sir. <br>
(The Sergeant hangs up the Doctor's coat and leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: I'm not too late, am I? <br>
BRIGADIER: What for? <br>
DOCTOR 2: For your speech as guest of honour. <br>
BRIGADIER: How did you know? <br>
DOCTOR 2: I saw it in the Times. <br>
CRICHTON: That's impossible. The reporter's still here. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Tomorrow's Times. And, er, and who is this? <br>
BRIGADIER: That's Colonel Crichton, my replacement. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Ah. Yes, mine was pretty unpromising, too. <br>
BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor, we'll take a stroll round the ground,
shall we? Awfully sorry about this. Do excuse me for a moment. DOCTOR
2: You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm. Don't like it. <br>
(The Brigadier collects their coats and goes to the French windows.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR 2: After you. <br>
BRIGADIER: What? <br>
DOCTOR 2: After you. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, very well. <br>
(Outside, the Brigadier helps the Doctor on with his coat. The Sergeant
enters.) <br>
SERGEANT: Everything all right, sir? <br>
CRICHTON: What the blazes is going on? Who was that strange little man?
<br>
SERGEANT: The Doctor. <br>
CRICHTON: Who?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor fastens his coat with a piece of
string.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes. Yeti, Cybermen. We've seen some times, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR 2: And Omega. Don't forget Omega. <br>
BRIGADIER: As if I could! <br>
DOCTOR 2: And the terrible Zodin. <br>
BRIGADIER: Who? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Oh, you weren't concerned with her, were you? She happened in
the future. They were covered in hair. Used to hop like kangaroos.
Well, I must say goodbye, Brigadier. I really shouldn't be here at all.
I'm not exactly breaking the laws of time, but I am bending them a
little. <br>
BRIGADIER: You never did bother much about rules, as I remember. What's
the matter? <br>
(The conical object is heading their way.) <br>
BRIGADIER: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Brigadier, I think our past is catching up on us. Or maybe
it's our future. Come on, run! <br>
(They run for the trees.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I'm too old for his sort of thing. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Where's it gone? We must get back to the Tardis before it's
too late. Run! <br>
(But the cone gets them both. The gloved hand places two figures in
another section of the pentagon.)

DOCTOR 5: It's fading. It's all fading. <br>
TURLOUGH: What's fading? <br>
DOCTOR 5: Great chunks of my past, detaching themselves like melting
icebergs. Ah!<br>
(More pain.) <br>
TEGAN: Do something. Help him! <br>
DOCTOR 5: Oh, no. No, don't look so worried. I'll have it all worked
out soon. Everything's all right. Everything's quite all right. <br>
(The Doctor puts his hands on Turlough and Tegan's shoulders, and
collapses.)

he sees the cone coming for him.) <br>
DOCTOR 3: Great balls of fire! <br>
(He turns Bessie around in a junction and floors the accelerator. After
a few moments he loses sight of the cone in his wing mirror.) DOCTOR 3:
Good old Bessie. <br>
(And promptly gets swept up and taken away. <br>

to do? <br>
TURLOUGH: He seems to be under some kind of psychic attack. <br>
DOCTOR 5: I am being diminished. Whittled away, piece by piece. A man
is the sum of his memories, you know. A Time Lord even more so. <br>
TEGAN: What can we do to help you? <br>
DOCTOR 5: Get me into the Tardis. <br>
(They carry him back into the ruins.) <br>

trundles down the driveway.) <br>
K9: Mistress, do not go out. <br>
SARAH: What is it? <br>
K9: Danger, Mistress. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
K9: I can sense danger, Mistress. Telepathic trace faint but rapidly
increasing in strength. Do not go out. <br>
SARAH: What kind of danger? <br>
K9: Positive data not yet available. <br>
SARAH: Well, I can't stay home. You have to give me a reason. <br>
K9: Negative, Mistress. Data analysis shows too many variables. Danger
readings now becoming much higher, Mistress. Suggestion. Take me with
you. <br>
SARAH: I can't. Honestly, I can't. The car's in docks so I've got to go
by bus. <br>
K9: There is danger, Mistress. My sensors indicate it is now extreme.
And the Doctor is involved. <br>
SARAH: Well, now I know you're imagining things. See you later. <br>

K9: Danger! Doctor! Danger! Mistress!

Doctor and the First Romana are punting.) <br>
DOCTOR 4: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvell,
Judge Jeffreys, Owen Chadwick. <br>
ROMANA: Who?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR 4: Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes, some of the greatest labourers in the
history of Earth have thought here. <br>
ROMANA: Newton, of course. <br>
DOCTOR 4: Oh, definitely Newton. <br>
ROMANA: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. <br>
DOCTOR 4: That's right. <br>
ROMANA: So, Newton invented punting. <br>
DOCTOR 4: Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius. <br>
ROMANA: Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so <br>
DOCTOR 4: Restful? <br>
ROMANA: No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in
the other. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, the colours. <br>
DOCTOR 4: It's October. <br>
ROMANA: I thought you said we were coming here for May week. <br>
DOCTOR 4: I did. May week's in June. <br>
ROMANA: I'm confused. <br>
DOCTOR 4: So was the Tardis. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours. <br>
DOCTOR 4: Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt
nothing can go wrong. No co-ordinates, no dimensional stabilisers,
nothing. Just the water, the punt, a strong pair of hands and a pole. <br>
(The pole becomes stuck as they go under another bridge. The cone comes
down and whisks them both away. <br>
The gloved hand punches frustratedly at its controls as the image
refuses to become a model.)

get away. Her model is placed with the Third Doctor's on the pentagon.)
<br>
TEGAN: Two hearts. <br>
TURLOUGH: Well, his body's all right. He just seems to be fading away.
Why did he have to set the Tardis moving? We were safe before he did
that. <br>
TEGAN: Look <br>
(The Doctor starts to fade in and out.) <br>
TEGAN: Doctor? <br>
(The time rotor stops moving.) <br>
TEGAN: What's going on?&nbsp;<br>
TURLOUGH: We've landed. <br>
(Turlough turns on the scanner to show the desolate place with the Dark
Tower in the distance. <br>
The gloved hand places three figures in the fifth section of the
pentagon whilst the fourth flashes on and off.) <br>
TURLOUGH: According to the instruments, we're nowhere, in no time. <br>
TEGAN: The Doctor must have forgotten to reconnect something. <br>
TURLOUGH: No. The instruments are all working perfectly. They just
won't tell us anything. The Tardis is paralysed. <br>
TEGAN: How did we get here? What do we do now? <br>
TURLOUGH: We wait until the Doctor recovers. <br>

CASTELLAN: The constitution clearly states that when in emergency
session, the members of the inner council are unanimous <br>
FLAVIA: Which indeed we are <br>
BORUSA: The President of the Council may be overruled. What a
ridiculous clause. Very well, have him enter. <br>
CASTELLAN: With all due respect, Lord President, your regeneration has
not helped your stubbornness. <br>
(Citadel guards open the doors and the Master enters.) <br>
MASTER: Lord President, Castellan, Chancellor Flavia. This is a very
great and, may I say, a most unexpected honour. I may be seated? Now
then, what can I do for you? <br>
BORUSA: You are one of the most evil and corrupt beings this Time Lord
race has ever produced. Your crimes are without number and your
villainy without end. Nevertheless, we are prepared to offer you a full
and free pardon. <br>
MASTER: What makes you think I want your forgiveness? <br>
CASTELLAN: We can offer you an alternative to your renegade existence. <br>
BORUSA: Regeneration. A complete new life cycle. <br>

(They embrace.) <br>
SUSAN: Thank goodness I've found you. How did we get here? What's
happening? <br>
DOCTOR 1: I wish I knew, my dear. <br>
SUSAN: As soon as I found myself in this horrible place I started
looking for you. Somehow I knew I'd find you here. <br>
DOCTOR 1: Well, the important question now is where are we, and why? <br>
(The shadow of a Dalek appears on another wall.) <br>
SUSAN: (sotto) We must be on Skaro. <br>
DOCTOR 1: (sotto) We were brought here. Perhaps the Dalek was, too. <br>
(The Dalek comes round the corner.) <br>
SUSAN: Run, Grandfather! <br>

Doctor. The Doctor must be destroyed. Exterminate. Exterminate.

CASTELLAN: Recently, the Zone has become reactivated. Somehow, it is
draining energy from the Eye of Harmony. <br>
FLAVIA: To an extent which endangers all Gallifrey. <br>
BORUSA: We must know what is happening there. <br>
MASTER: Did it occur to you to go and look? <br>
BORUSA: Two of the High Council went into the Zone. Neither returned. <br>
MASTER: So you sent for the Doctor? <br>
CASTELLAN: We looked for the Doctor, but he no longer exists. Not in
any of his regenerations. <br>
BORUSA: The Doctor has been taken out of time. <br>
(An image of the Fourth Doctor and Romana appears on the screen.) <br>
CASTELLAN: We believe the attempt to lift him from his time stream was
unsuccessful. There he must stay until we can find and free his other
selves. <br>
MASTER: And if you cannot? The cosmos without the Doctor scarcely bares
thinking about. What makes you think his other selves are in the Zone? <br>
BORUSA: Their time traces. They converge there. <br>
MASTER: And you can get me into the Zone? <br>
CASTELLAN: We have a power-boosted, open-ended transmat beam. <br>
MASTER: Ah. Why me? <br>
BORUSA: Because we need someone determined, experienced, ruthless,
cunning. <br>
MASTER: And disposable? <br>
CASTELLAN: Not at all. You would be useless to us dead. <br>

DOCTOR 2: You want to get home? <br>
BRIGADIER: Of course. <br>
DOCTOR 2: That is why we are here. Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever
led you astray? <br>
BRIGADIER: On many occasions. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, well, this will be the exception. Come along.

looks at the harp standing nearby and reads its inscription.) <br>
DOCTOR 5: The Harp of Rassilon. I never knew he was musical. Borusa
either for that matter. <br>

the massive sarcophagus with its emblems of Time Lords on the side.

enters from the other side with Sarah.) <br>
DOCTOR 1: Ah, there you are at last, dear fellow. What kept you? <br>
DOCTOR 3: What kept me? Of all the confounded arrogance. <br>
DOCTOR 1: Never mind, never mind, you can tell me later. Come and take
a look at this. <br>
DOCTOR 3: What is it? <br>

TEGAN: Tegan. <br>

DOCTOR 3: Hmm. Fascinating. <br>
DOCTOR 1: What happened to the little fellow? <br>
DOCTOR 2: The little fellow is perfectly all right, thank you very
much. Of course I'm here. You don't imagine anything you two could do
could stump me, do you? Let's have a look. What's this? <br>
(He pushes the other two Doctors aside.) <br>
TEGAN + SARAH: Brigadier? <br>
BRIGADIER: Good heavens. It's Miss Smith, isn't it. Miss Jovanka. Don't
ask me how we got here. It was like a cross between Guy Fawkes and
Hallowe'en. <br>
DOCTOR 3: Lethbridge Stewart? Oh, my dear fellow. How very nice to see
you again. <br>
BRIGADIER: Great heavens, you as well? Though I can't exactly say it's
nice to be here. Do you know, I was enjoying <br>
DOCTOR 3: You'll have to excuse me, old chap. We've got a very
important inscription to translate and I think they'll get it all wrong
without me. <br>
BRIGADIER: Typical. Absolutely typical. <br>
SARAH: Oh, I know, I know. Drag you through time and space without so
much as a bye or leave, then leave you out when things get interesting.
<br>
TEGAN: My version isn't any better. <br>
SARAH: Which one's yours? <br>
DOCTOR 2: So, that's what it's all about. I never dreamed. <br>
DOCTOR 1: It changes nothing, absolutely nothing. We lower the
forcefield, get the young fellow back from Gallifrey and all go home.
This doesn't concern us. It mustn't. <br>
TEGAN: What does the inscription say? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'd quite like to know as well. <br>
SARAH: Yes, we've all been through a great deal to get here. <br>
DOCTOR 1: You. Tell them. <br>
DOCTOR 2: It's Old High Gallifreyan, the ancient language of the Time
Lords. Not many people understand it these days. <br>
THE DOCTORS: Fortunately, I do. <br>
BRIGADIER: All very interesting, I'm sure, Doctors, but what does it
say? <br>
DOCTOR 3: That this is the Tomb of Rassilon, where Rassilon lies in
eternal sleep. <br>
DOCTOR 2: It also says that anyone who's got this far has passed many
dangers and shown great courage and determination. What does this bit
mean? <br>
DOCTOR 3: To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose. <br>
DOCTOR 2: I know what it says. What does it mean? <br>
DOCTOR 1: It also promises that whoever takes the ring from Rassilon's
hand and puts it on shall get the reward he seeks. <br>
SARAH: What reward? <br>
DOCTOR 1: Immortality. <br>
BRIGADIER: What, live forever? Never die? <br>
DOCTOR 1: That is what the word means, young man. <br>
SARAH: But that's impossible. <br>
DOCTOR 3: Apparently not. <br>
DOCTOR 2: It seems Rassilon possesses it now, and is willing to share
it with whoever takes the ring. <br>
MASTER: Thank you, gentlemen, that is exactly what I needed to know. I
came here to help you. A little unwillingly, but I came. My services
were scorned, my help refused. Now I shall help myself to immortality. <br>
DOCTOR 1: Out of the question. <br>
DOCTOR 3: You're hardly a suitable candidate. <br>
DOCTOR 2: For anything. <br>
(The Master points his tissue compression eliminator at the Doctors.) <br>
MASTER: The decision is scarcely yours. Killing you once was never
enough for me, Doctor. How, how gratifying to do it three times over. <br>
BRIGADIER: Nice to see you again. <br>

punch to the chin, knocking him out.)

BORUSA: You show very little surprise. Can it be that you suspected me?

DOCTOR 5: Not at first. Your little charade fooled me for a while. <br>
BORUSA: Yes, it was rather neat, wasn't it? Such a pity about the
Castellan, but then I needed someone to use for a diversion. <br>

I could continue <br>

BORUSA: Perhaps, but you will never overcome me. <br>
DOCTOR 5: We don't need to. Soon, Chancellor Flavia will be here with
her guards, or can you overcome the whole High Council? <br>

notorious renegades. We shall see who is believed. <br>

DOCTOR 2: Don't believe him. <br>
DOCTOR 5: It's nonsense. <br>
DOCTOR 1: Don't listen to them, Lord Rassilon. President Borusa speaks
the truth. <br>
RASSILON: You believe that Borusa deserves the immortality he seeks? <br>
DOCTOR 1: Indeed I do. <br>
RASSILON: He shall have it. Take the Ring. <br>

corpse on the top of the sarcophagus.) <br>
RASSILON: You claim immortality, Lord Borusa. You will not turn back? <br>
BORUSA: Never! <br>
RASSILON: Then put on the Ring. Others have come to claim immortality
through the ages. It was given to them, as it shall be given to you. <br>

flickering one way and another.) <br>

Borusa vanishes and his face appears in the black portion of the
sarcophagus. His eyes flicker briefly, then they all return to stone.
The companions can move again.) <br>
RASSILON: And what of you, Doctors? Do you claim immortality too? <br>
DOCTORS: That's very kind of you. No. No, no thank you! <br>
DOCTOR 5: No, my Lord. All we ask is that we be returned to our proper
place in time and space. <br>
RASSILON: It shall be done. <br>
DOCTOR 5: One of us is trapped. <br>
RASSILON: I know. He too shall be freed. <br>
(The Fourth Doctor and Romana return to their punt.) <br>
RASSILON: So shall the one who is bound. His sins will find their
punishment in due time. <br>
(The Master disappears.) <br>
RASSILON: It is time for your other selves to depart. Let them make
their farewells and go. You have chosen wisely, Doctor. Farewell. <br>
(Rassilon vanishes. The First Doctor chuckles.) <br>
DOCTOR 5: Did you know what would happen? <br>
DOCTOR 1: Hmm? Oh, I'm so sorry. I suddenly realised what the old
proverb meant. To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose. It was all
part of Rassilon's trap to find out who wanted immortality and put him
out of the way. He knew very well that immortality was a curse, not a
blessing. <br>
DOCTOR 5: Well, now it seems we must part, just as I was getting to
know me. <br>
DOCTOR 2: So, you're the latest model, hmm? <br>

FLAVIA: It can form part of your inaugural address. <br>
DOCTOR 5: My what? <br>
FLAVIA: Doctor, you have evaded your responsibilities for far too long.
The disqualification of President Borusa leaves a gap at the very
summit of the Time Lord hierarchy. There is only one who can take this
place. Yet again, it is my duty and my pleasure to inform you that the
full Council has exercised its emergency powers to appoint you to the
position of President, to take office immediately. <br>
DOCTOR 5: Oh, no. <br>
FLAVIA: This is a summons no Time Lord dare refuse. To disobey the will
of the High Council will attract the severest penalties. <br>
DOCTOR 5: Very well, Chancellor Flavia. You will return to Gallifrey
immediately and summon the High Council. You have full deputy powers
until I return. I shall travel in my Tardis. <br>
FLAVIA: Oh, but Doctor <br>
DOCTOR 5: You will address me by my proper title. I am President, am I
not? You will obey my commands. (to Tegan and Turlough) Into the
