IAN: Perhaps we've landed on top of something. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
BARBARA: Or inside something. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? This says everything has stopped, but the ship. <br>
SUSAN: What did you mean, Barbara, inside something? <br>
IAN: Perhaps that's why we still appear to be moving. <br>
BARBARA: Try the scanner, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Covered with static. Let's try it again, Susan. <br>
(The screen is just streaks of static) <br>
IAN: That could be caused by an unsuppressed motor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, or a magnetic field. <br>
SUSAN: Shall we go outside, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I shan't be happy until I've solved this little mystery. <br>
BARBARA: I don't know why we ever bother to leave the ship. <br>
DOCTOR: You're still thinking about the experiences you had with the
Aztecs. <br>
BARBARA: No, I've got over that now. <br>
IAN: There's one thing about it, Doctor. We're certainly different from
when we started out with you. <br>
SUSAN: That's funny. Grandfather and I were talking about that just
before you came in. How you've both changed. <br>
BARBARA: Well we've all changed. <br>
SUSAN: Have I? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it all started out as a mild curiosity in a junkyard, and
now it's turned out to be quite a, quite a great spirit of adventure,
don't you think? <br>
IAN: Yes. We've had some pretty rough times and even that doesn't stop
us. It's a wonderful thing, this ship of yours, Doctor. Taken us back
to prehistoric times, the Daleks. <br>
SUSAN: Marco Polo, Marinus. <br>
BARBARA: And the Aztecs. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and that extraordinary quarrel I had with that English
king, Henry the Eighth. You know, he threw a parson's nose at me. <br>
BARBARA: What did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: Threw it back, of course. Take them to the Tower, he said.
That's why I did it. <br>
BARBARA: Why? <br>
SUSAN: The Tardis was inside the Tower. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, it was long before you appeared on the scene.
However, now, let us get back to this little problem. Open the door,
Susan. <br>
IAN: Have you checked everything, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Plenty of fresh air, temperature normal. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, just the unknown, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They walk out into a room with people in uniform
sitting in chairs, very still) <br>
IAN: You were right, Barbara. We have landed in something. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a spaceship. Close the door, Susan. Let us be careful.
There's been some kind of catastrophe here. <br>
(Ian takes the pulse of one man. He's intact, flexible, but) <br>
IAN: Dead. <br>
SUSAN: This one's a girl. <br>
BARBARA: I'm afraid she's the same. What could have happened? I can't
see a wound or anything. <br>
IAN: Suffocation, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I never make uninformed guesses, my friend, but certainly
that's one answer. Oh, dear, dear, dear, what a tragedy you know. She's
only a few years older than Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, let's go back to the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
SUSAN: I don't know. I've got a feeling about this. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, I can sense something too. <br>
IAN: You mean that whatever it was killed them could kill us? <br>
DOCTOR: Chesterton, have you noticed anything about this watch? (and
the man's) Neither of them are working. These are the non-winding type.
A movement of the wrist recharges the spring inside for twenty four
hours. <br>
IAN: Yes, and they both stopped at about three o'clock. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, then suppose we say that they've only just stopped. Now
that would mean that the last movement of their wrists would be at
least twenty four hours ago. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, he's still warm. <br>
BARBARA: Then they've only just died. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't make sense, does it. But the facts are all here. I
think it would be wise if we returned to the ship and left these
people. There's nothing we can do for them. <br>
BARBARA: No, we can't even bury them. <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, open the door, Susan. <br>
(The man groans and slumps forward over his desk) <br>
IAN: His heart had stopped beating, Doctor. He was dead. <br>
MAITLAND: (something) <br>
IAN: What do you want? Yes? <br>
MAITLAND: Over there. <br>
IAN: Where? There? <br>
MAITLAND: Behind you. <br>
IAN: Here? <br>
MAITLAND: No, on the left. <br>
IAN: What, this? (a metal box) <br>
MAITLAND: Yes, that. <br>
(Ian gives it to him, and a heartbeat starts up) <br>
MAITLAND: Carol. Place this against Carol's chest. <br>
BARBARA: I'm sorry, Carol's dead. <br>
MAITLAND: Please, do as I ask. <br>
(The heartbeat sound and she wakes up) <br>
IAN: You were both dead. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, what was in that box? <br>
MAITLAND: It's a heart resuscitator. When you found us, we were in a
very long sleep, but we weren't dead. My name is Maitland. This is
Carol Richmond, my co-astronaut. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, are you from the Earth? <br>
MAITLAND: Yes. <br>
BARBARA: So are we. How's it looking? <br>
CAROL: The Earth, do you mean? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
CAROL: Still too much air traffic. <br>
IAN: They got it off the roads, did they? <br>
MAITLAND: You might say that, yes. <br>
IAN: Barbara and I, we come from London. Tell me, is Big Ben still on
time? <br>
MAITLAND: What century do you come from? The twenty first, perhaps? <br>
BARBARA: No, the twentieth. <br>
MAITLAND: I see. <br>
CAROL: What's Big Ben? <br>
BARBARA: Well, it's a clock. Near Westminster Abbey. <br>
MAITLAND: Yes, you see, the whole lower half of England is called
Central City now. There hasn't been a London for four hundred years. We
come from the twenty eighth century. <br>
CAROL: Captain Maitland, these people must leave immediately. <br>
MAITLAND: Yes, you will have to. <br>
IAN: But there are so many things we want to know. <br>
MAITLAND: There's only danger here for you. You must go. <br>
BARBARA: Danger? What sort of danger? <br>
MAITLAND: It's better that you don't know what happened to us. <br>
BARBARA: But we might be able to help you. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, Barbara. I learned not to meddle in other people's
affairs years ago. (Ian laughs) Now, now, now, don't be absurd. There's
not an ounce of curiosity in me, my dear boy. Tell me, why are you in
danger? <br>
MAITLAND: Very well, I'll try to explain. Out there is a planet we call
the Sensphere. The creatures on it, the Sensorites, have always
prevented us from leaving this area of space. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean they have some kind of power over your craft. <br>
MAITLAND: Exactly. But it's not that simple. They not only control our
craft, they have some influence over us as well. <br>
DOCTOR: Hypnosis, do you mean? <br>
MAITLAND: No, I do not mean hypnosis. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what then? <br>
MAITLAND: Somehow they have some control over our brains. They are
hostile, these Sensorites, but in the strangest possible way. They
won't let us leave this area of space yet they don't attempt to kill
us. <br>
SUSAN: What had happened when we found you? <br>
CAROL: The same thing that's happened many times before. The Sensorites
have put us into a deep sleep that gives the appearance of death, and
yet they've never made any actual effort to destroy us. <br>
MAITLAND: Far from it. We both have very hazy recollections of them
returning from time to time to our ship to actually feed us. <br>
IAN: Doesn't add up at all. <br>
CAROL: This is why you must leave us at once. <br>
MAITLAND: Yes. The Sensorites may try to prevent you from leaving. <br>
(An alien hand holds a device over the Tardis lock) <br>
BARBARA: I can smell something burning. <br>
SUSAN: So can I. <br>
MAITLAND: You mustn't delay any longer. <br>
IAN: I'm inclined to agree with him, Doctor. But surely there's
something we can do for you? <br>
MAITLAND: No. Nobody can help us. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, couldn't we take them back with us? <br>
MAITLAND: We cannot leave this ship. <br>
CAROL: You see, there's John to think of too. <br>
DOCTOR: John? <br>
BARBARA: Ian, there is something burning. <br>
IAN: Yes, I think you're right. Maitland, you wouldn't have anything
shorting, would you? <br>
MAITLAND: No, that's not possible. <br>
(Amid smoke, the alien hand withdraws the Tardis lock mechanism from
the door) <br>
BARBARA: It seems to be coming from over here. <br>
DOCTOR: You have additional crew, I take it? <br>
CAROL: Yes. <br>
MAITLAND: Doctor, you must go. Leave us. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it seems to me that there's nothing else I can do.
Goodbye, my friend. Bye, bye, my child. Come along, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Goodbye. <br>
BARBARA: It's stronger over here, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? Perhaps it's coming from inside the Tardis. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather! <br>
DOCTOR: Good gracious! They've taken the lock! <br>
SUSAN: It's not so much the lock, it's the opening mechanism. The
door's permanently locked! <br>
IAN: Permanently? But there must be some way of getting in? What can we
do, Doctor? Break down the door? <br>
DOCTOR: And disturb the field dimensions inside the Tardis? We dare
not. We've been most effectively shut out. <br>
BARBARA: The Sensorites? <br>
DOCTOR: Who else? <br>
SUSAN: What do they want with us? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. And why have they kept those other two in
captivity, hmm? <br>
(the ship shakes) <br>
CAROL: The Sensorites! Get back! Get away! <br>
IAN: Must get up the other end. <br>
DOCTOR: What is happening, my friend? Can't you control the ship? <br>
MAITLAND: I'm powerless. The Sensorites are stronger than I am. <br>
DOCTOR: Which is your parallel thrust? <br>
MAITLAND: There. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Velocity, Chesterton. Check velocity. <br>
IAN: It's not even on the unit marker, Doctor. <br>
MAITLAND: Don't try and control the spacecraft. It's suicide, I tell
you. <br>
DOCTOR: Please go away. <br>
IAN: The velocity needle's hitting the red, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, stabilisers, Maitland. <br>
(The ship stops shaking) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, at last. At last. The ship was rolling about on its axis. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, look! We're heading straight for it. <br>
CAROL: It's the Sense-Sphere. <br>
DOCTOR: Where's your deflection rays? Maitland! Deflection rays. <br>
MAITLAND: There, the white panel. But it's useless. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we'll see about that. We'll see about that. Reading,
please. <br>
CAROL: Mach three, braking one. <br>
IAN: Nineteen miles to the nearest point of impact. <br>
CAROL: Closing fast. <br>
SUSAN: Barbara, we're going to hit. We're going to hit! <br>
CAROL: Lifting slightly. <br>
MAITLAND: You're on collision course. <br>
DOCTOR: Jet. Jet course. Port. Now. <br>
IAN: Velocity still rising. <br>
DOCTOR: Jet reverse. Starboard. Now. <br>
CAROL: Increasing to mach four. Heading straight for point of impact. <br>
IAN: The altitude is still falling. <br>
CAROL: Mach four. <br>
DOCTOR: Barbara, see that panel? Check status. Three lights normal. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. Three lights on. <br>
DOCTOR: Boost engines. Forward thrust and lock. <br>
(The planet fills the viewscreen, then they veer off to the left) <br>
MAITLAND: Why couldn't I do it? <br>
(later) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my friend, are you feeling better? <br>
MAITLAND: Yes, my head's much clearer. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I rather fancy that's settled that little bit of
solution. You know, I think these Sensorites have found a way to take
control of your minds. <br>
IAN: Do you think they were deliberately trying to kill us, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I don't. I think it was an exercise in fear and power. <br>
CAROL: Yes, but for some reason or other your minds aren't open to
them. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and you found a way to resist them, whereas Maitland here,
his power to resist was taken from him. <br>
MAITLAND: I was afraid. <br>
IAN: You weren't afraid. They just made you hopeless. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, they're dangerous and cunning, these people. But that's
not all. Things are very strange here. You know, they can control, they
can frighten and yet they don't attempt to kill you. Furthermore, they
feed you and keep you alive. All this is most extraordinary. <br>
IAN: Yes. Talking about food, I shall be glad when we eat. How's it
coming along? <br>
BARBARA: All right. Be ready in a minute. <br>
SUSAN: Iron rations a la carte. <br>
CAROL: Well, from the size of our stocks, they've obviously been giving
us their own food. <br>
BARBARA: What about water, Carol? <br>
CAROL: Down there on the right. <br>
BARBARA: Right, we'll find it. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, have either of you ever met any of these creatures or
seen them? <br>
CAROL: John has. <br>
IAN: Ah, he's the other member of your crew, isn't he. <br>
MAITLAND: Yes, our mineralogist. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd like to have a talk with him. <br>
MAITLAND: I'm afraid that's out of the question. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? Why not? <br>
MAITLAND: I'd rather not talk about it. <br>
(Barbara and Susan walk past the tank marked water to a hatch) <br>
BARBARA: I suppose she meant the water was through this door. Let's try
it. <br>
SUSAN: I can't see any handle on the door. Try this. That doesn't work.
<br>
(then she spots the electric eye and waves her hand in front of it. The
hatch opens) <br>
SUSAN: That's funny. Oh, I see, it's the ray. I must have broken the
connection. <br>
BARBARA: Let's get that water. I'm dying of thirst. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, so am I. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They step through the hatch) <br>
BARBARA: Well, down here on the right, she said. <br>
(And another hand shuts the hatch behind them. It belongs to a
shuffling man with a glazed expression) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cabin]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The women find a small room) <br>
BARBARA: I don't think we should stay in here. <br>
SUSAN: (picking up a book) Hey, this is bliss. <br>
BARBARA: I wonder where that water is? <br>
SUSAN: I don't know. <br>
BARBARA: Shh. Listen. <br>
(The shuffling footsteps come closer) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: Don't you see? John may be able to give us
some valuable information. <br>
CAROL: I told you. You can't see him. <br>
DOCTOR: You're both being rather secretive. <br>
IAN: Where are the others? <br>
(Maitland rushes to the hatch and tries to open it) <br>
MAITLAND: We should have warned them. <br>
IAN: What is it? What's wrong? <br>
CAROL: The door's been locked on the other side. Quickly. They're in
danger. We must get in from the other end. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MAITLAND: This way. This is the other way through.
<br>
CAROL: Oh, it's no use. The ray's been jammed on the other side. <br>
MAITLAND: I'm sorry, Ian. There's nothing we can do. <br>
IAN: But what is it? What's wrong? What's going on inside there? <br>
MAITLAND: It's no use, no use. <br>
IAN: Barbara! Susan! <br>
CAROL: No! No, please. No! <br>
IAN: Are there Sensorites in there? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The shuffling man comes right up to Barbara and
Susan, they step to one side and he falls over. They run back down the
corridor but the hatch doesn't open for them. They duck into a store
room instead) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The man comes in as they hide behind the filing
cabinet, and starts crying, then staggers out again without seeing
them) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CAROL: We must find out about John. <br>
MAITLAND: We've been over this a hundred times before, Carol. <br>
CAROL: But the other times were different. The Sensorites made our
decisions for us. <br>
MAITLAND: As far as we know they still do. <br>
CAROL: But the Doctor and the others showed us we can resist them. We
can! It's only fear that makes us weak, that's all. <br>
MAITLAND: That may be so, but we mustn't go in there, Carol. It's too
dangerous. <br>
CAROL: What you really mean is, I mustn't go in there. You're afraid
for me, aren't you? <br>
MAITLAND: I know what John means to you. <br>
CAROL: The last time I saw him, he didn't even know my name. I must see
him. I must find out. Besides, there are the girls. <br>
MAITLAND: All right. <br>
IAN: Maitland, you must get that door opened. <br>
MAITLAND: Yes, I'll have to cut round the lock. <br>
IAN: All right, well get on with it. <br>
MAITLAND: I'll get the machine rigged up. <br>
IAN: Carol, tell me. What is it that you're both afraid of? <br>
CAROL: John's in there with your friends. He and I were going to get
married when we got back to the Earth. The Sensorites attacked him far
more than Captain Maitland and me. I had to sit there helplessly and
watch him get worse and worse. <br>
IAN: You mean they've taken over his mind. <br>
CAROL: Yes. <br>
IAN: What's it done to him? Carol, you've got to tell me. <br>
CAROL: He'll be frightened of strangers. He may become violent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Barbara and Susan sneak out of the storage room,
but don't see John leaning against the wall. He pushes a lever then
shuffles after them. They cannot open any other doors. Just as they
think he's going to attack them, he falls to his knees) <br>
SUSAN: He's crying. <br>
JOHN: Who are you? You look like my sister. Have you come to help me?
Four years. <br>
BARBARA: Are you one of the crew of the spaceship? You want to tell me
something? About yourself? <br>
SUSAN: Is he trying to say he's ill? <br>
JOHN: Yes. Ill. <br>
BARBARA: (comforting him) Don't be afraid. We'll take care of you. <br>
SUSAN: What do you think happened to him, Barbara? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Maitland is cutting into the door with a sonic
device) <br>
IAN: Where's the power come from? <br>
MAITLAND: Electro-magnectics. We should be to the locks very soon. <br>
IAN: You say you haven't seen John for months? <br>
CAROL: He was dangerous once the Sensorites got at his brain. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't you go faster? Susan's in there. <br>
MAITLAND: It won't be long now. <br>
(There's a noise, Maitland stops) <br>
DOCTOR: Now what is it? Get on with the job, please. <br>
MAITLAND: Listen, don't you hear it? I thought there was something
else. <br>
IAN: You mean that high-pitched whine? Is that it? <br>
MAITLAND: Sensorites. <br>
CAROL: They must be near. That noise is caused by the machines that
carry them through space. <br>
MAITLAND: Carol, get back to your instruments. Doctor, would you take
the controller seat? <br>
DOCTOR: Anything but this awful waiting. <br>
IAN: What about Barbara and Susan.<br>
MAITLAND: There's no time now. Look for glowing lights on the move
about the ship. <br>
IAN: How will they attack us? <br>
MAITLAND: They won't. Not in the normal way. <br>
IAN: Then how can we defend ourselves. <br>
MAITLAND: You'll find out soon enough. Look out there. There they are!
See them moving? <br>
IAN: Yes, but they look miles away. <br>
MAITLAND: It won't take them long to get here. <br>
IAN: How long do you think it'll take them, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. They must have made the journey before. They were
here before, remember? They took away the lock mechanism from my ship. <br>
IAN: Yes. Probably took it back to their own planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and now they're coming back, with what orders? To take
over our minds? Hmm? Or to kill us? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BARBARA: Do you hear that? <br>
SUSAN: It's coming from outside. <br>
BARBARA: No, you need rest. There's nothing wrong. <br>
JOHN: I'll protect you. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. All right. You'll protect us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: Would it be a good idea to move? <br>
MAITLAND: Where to? We already know we can't leave this area of space. <br>
IAN: All the same, I think <br>
MAITLAND: Anyway, we're not going to be destroyed. Had the Sensorites
intended that, they would have done so long ago. <br>
IAN: If that collision course was their idea of a joke, I'd hate to be
one of their enemies. <br>
CAROL: They wouldn't really try to crash us. They just keep on playing
this game of nerves. <br>
DOCTOR: What's that noise? <br>
MAITLAND: Yes, we always hear that. <br>
CAROL: Interference now on all our scans. <br>
MAITLAND: Now remember, all of you, no violence unless the Sensorites
start it first. <br>
IAN: Why no violence? Surely we've got the right to protect ourselves? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Chesterton. It's our minds that they take over, so we
must presume that the brain is all important. Now let our own
intelligence be our own defence, and attack. <br>
(It goes quiet) <br>
CAROL: I can sense them all around us now. <br>
MAITLAND: Shh. <br>
IAN: Doctor. Doctor. <br>

the stronger. <br>
IAN: Doctor, look at these two. <br>
DOCTOR: Maitland. Maitland! Can you hear me? Fear, my boy. It's
loosened his mind. It gives the Sensorites a chance to control it. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, ignore it. Maitland! <br>
MAITLAND: Yes. I hear you. <br>

MAITLAND: Work. <br>

SUSAN: Just a few minutes ago. What is it? <br>
JOHN: They're here. Inside here. <br>
BARBARA: John, open the door. <br>
JOHN: Frighten them? No, I can't do that. No. No. <br>
SUSAN: Somebody's talking to him. Inside his mind. <br>
JOHN: No, don't force me. You can't. I won't do it. My head! Pain.
(unintelligible) <br>
SUSAN: Somebody's ordering him to do something, I know they are.
Something to harm us. </font></p>

IAN: Oh, not again. How long will this take? <br>
MAITLAND: It's the only way. <br>
IAN: Yes, I know. Just that I'm so worried about Barbara and Susan. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, now. Try and contain your emotions. Use self-control.
Otherwise it confuses the brain and leaves it wide open to an attack by
the Sensorites. Look at Maitland here. Fear and inertia left him
vulnerable. <br>
IAN: Yes, it's true enough, Doctor. <br>
CAROL: The Sensorites are in the ship now. <br>
IAN: What? How did they get here? <br>
CAROL: Through the loading bay. <br>
DOCTOR: But that can't be where Barbara and Susan are now? <br>
CAROL: No, but we must get to them as soon as possible. <br>
IAN: Nobody's arguing about that. <br>
DOCTOR: But that man John's with them. <br>
CAROL: The Sensorites have control over John's mind. They may force him
to obey their orders. <br>
IAN: How's it coming. <br>
MAITLAND: Slowly, but it's working. <br>
IAN: If only we knew what was happening on the other side of this door.

JOHN: Give me your hand. They want me to frighten you. I mustn't give

SUSAN: He's so tense, Barbara. Can't we help him? <br>

JOHN: You're not afraid? <br>
BARBARA: Not while we have you to protect us. <br>
SUSAN: It's quiet and peaceful here. There's no real danger. <br>
JOHN: The Sensorites. <br>
BARBARA: We're your friends, John. <br>
JOHN: Friends. No, they are my friends! <br>
SUSAN: Barbara, I've got an idea. <br>
BARBARA: What? <br>
SUSAN: He's quiet now, but we can't be sure the Sensorites won't make
him help them. Look, if they can use their brains, why can't we use
ours? <br>
BARBARA: To defend him? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, and ourselves. Grandfather and I landed on a planet once
called Esto. The plants there used thought transference. If you stood
in between two of the plants, they set up a sort of screeching noise.
Grandfather said it was because they were aware of another mind. <br>
BARBARA: Breaking in on their communications. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, exactly. I thought if we both tried together. <br>
BARBARA: Well anything's better than just sitting here. <br>
JOHN: Sensorites! They're near us now. <br>
SUSAN: You see? If we both think of the same thing at the same time. <br>
BARBARA: What do you mean? We defy you. Something like that? <br>
SUSAN: Yes. Yes, we defy you. We've got to picture the words very
clearly in our minds. We must both concentrate very hard. Ready? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. When I count to five. One, (cut to Sensorites) four,
five. <br>

IAN: It's going. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, it might be possible for Susan's thoughts to reach out to
the Sensorites. <br>
CAROL: So we really can resist them? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. And there's that friend of yours, you know. John. We must
look after him. Let me see now. Of course, they have a hold of his
mind, you know. <br>
CAROL: He's sleeping peacefully now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder. Did Susan release the pressure? <br>
SUSAN: I had hundreds of voices in my mind, Grandfather. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and that was a dangerous thing to do, child. Because you
were strong-willed and without fear, they didn't harm you. <br>
MAITLAND: He's resting now. Did you know his hair was almost white? <br>
DOCTOR: There's nothing wrong with that. <br>
MAITLAND: In a man of thirty, Doctor? And he looks so old. Why have the
Sensorites done this? What do they want from us? <br>
DOCTOR: I <br>
IAN: Doctor. John muttered something just now, before he passed out.
Sounded like, the dreams of avarice. Now, on Earth we have a saying.
Rich beyond the dreams of avarice. I think he's discovered something.
Would explain why he's had the worst of it from the Sensorites. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. What were John's duties? <br>
MAITLAND: He's our mineralogist. <br>
IAN: You see? Makes sense. John mumbling something about riches. I
think he must have discovered something that the Sensorites wanted to
keep secret, so they silenced him and kept all of you prisoners about
their planet. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And now they're trying to do the same to us. We must get
the lock of the Tardis back. Have you tried talking to them? <br>
MAITLAND: Talking to them? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we must try. We must. </font></p>

SENSORITE 2: (a deeper voice) The human creatures who are newly arrived
seem to possess more intelligence than the others. <br>

BARBARA: And then what happened? <br>
CAROL: That was the first time the Sensorites attacked us. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you like to look at that graph for a moment? <br>
IAN: Yes. Oh, there's nothing much here. Very ordinary collection of
things. Oxygen, hydrogen, sodium. <br>
SUSAN: What's that? <br>
IAN: It's a spectrograph, Susan. You see these lines? They represent
the emission wavelengths. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, yes, of course. <br>

CAROL: You're very strange people. <br>
SUSAN: Are we? <br>
CAROL: Well, you've come from nowhere and you seem to be going nowhere.
<br>
BARBARA: We're very dependant on the Doctor. He leads and we follow. <br>
CAROL: Travel without a purpose? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, no, there's a purpose in it. He's trying to get us back to
our own time. On Earth. <br>
CAROL: Oh, I see. <br>
SUSAN: Isn't' it a better thing to travel hopefully than arrive? <br>
CAROL: Anything's better than circling round a planet for ever and
being kept alive. Alive. It's been more like a living death. <br>
DOCTOR: (having looked through a notebook) I just don't understand.
There must be a clue here somewhere. There must be. <br>
IAN: Well I don't know, Doctor. Certainly isn't here. <br>
MAITLAND: I studied it whenever I could, but it didn't look like
anything that would cause much excitement. The Sensphere is just an
ordinary planet with a slightly bigger land mass than usual, but that's
all. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. That's very interesting. May I? <br>
MAITLAND: Certainly. <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. <br>
SUSAN: I know the Sensorites have discovered thought transference. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. And when John discovered something, he became so excited
that his mind opened up and broadcast it to the Sensorites. And it was
something they wanted kept a secret. <br>
DOCTOR: What? What is this? What was it Chesterton said? Rich beyond
the dreams of avarice. Yes. Of course. Of course! I know what he found.
<br>
IAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Molybdenum. It's here, in the graph, but it's all mixed up with
the lines so it doesn't make obvious reading. <br>
IAN: Molybdenum? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
MAITLAND: It resists very high temperatures. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It's used as an alloy in steel. In fact this machine would
be useless without it. Now let me see. Iron melts at one thousand five
hundred and thirty nine degrees centigrade, and molybdenum melts at two
thousand six hundred and twenty two degrees centigrade. So, you know,
we've some idea. Yes, I see now just what John found. I wonder if he
was excited. Yes, that planet must be full of it. Full of it! It's a
veritable gold mine! <br>

soon as you discovered molybdenum. <br>

go back to their Earth, hmm? <br>
SENSORITE 2: None of you can ever again leave the area of the
Sensphere. <br>
IAN: Why not? <br>
SENSORITE 1: You know the answer to that. <br>
IAN: Because of molybdenum. We are not interested in it. <br>
SENSORITE 2: So you say, but once before we trusted Earth men, to our
cost. <br>
DOCTOR: So Earth men have visited the Sensphere. <br>
SENSORITE 1: Yes, and they caused us a fearful affliction. We shall not
allow it to happen again. <br>
MAITLAND: What do you expect us to do? Drift around for ever? <br>
SENSORITE 1: No, you must all come back with us. A special area has
been prepared for you on the Sensphere. There you will live, and there
you will be looked after. <br>
DOCTOR: These people cannot possibly accede to your request. It's out
of the question. <br>
SENSORITE 2: You will do exactly as we tell you because you have no
choice. None of you. <br>
DOCTOR: My party does have a choice, and I assure you we have no
intention of spending the rest of our lives with you. <br>

SENSORITE 1: We intend taking you down to the Sensphere, but we do not
wish to harm you in any way. <br>

must get off this ship. <br>
SENSORITE 1: What if we refuse? <br>
IAN: We will attack you. <br>
SENSORITE 1: The other Earth people will not be able to help you. <br>
BARBARA: Surely we've proved that we don't need help. <br>
SENSORITE 2: You have only proved that you can lock doors. We can
unlock them. <br>
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, both of you. You've taken the lock of my ship
and I want it returned immediately. <br>
SENSORITE 1: You're in no position to threaten us. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't make threats. But I do keep promises. And I promise you
I shall cause you more trouble than you bargained for if you don't
return my property! <br>

BARBARA: What do they mean, decide? <br>

to us. <br>

DOCTOR: Next time, if there is a next time, they might try and control
your mind, my child. Like they've done to these two people. <br>
MAITLAND: Doctor, is there no way you can get into your own ship? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not unless they return what they stole from my ship. <br>
CAROL: But they'll never give it back to you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear, they're not invincible. Oh, no, no, no. Did any of
you notice the peculiarity in their eyes? <br>
MAITLAND: No, I can't say I did. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a fallacy, of course, that cats can see in the dark. They
can't. But they can see better than we humans, because the iris of
their eyes dilates at night. Yes. <br>
IAN: What are you driving at, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all perfectly simple, Chesterton. You see, the
Sensorites eyes are the exact opposite to that of a cat. The Sensorites
eyes were completely dilated, that is, enormous, in light. <br>
IAN: The conclusion being that they would contract in darkness. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. And that is our best weapon. The Sensorites will be
frightened of the dark. <br>
SUSAN: You can't be sure of that. You're only sure they can't see in
the dark. <br>
DOCTOR: I very much doubt, my child, whether they can see in the
semi-darkness. <br>
BARBARA: But Doctor, assuming you're right <br>
IAN: Which he is, of course.<br>
DOCTOR: Naturally. <br>
BARBARA: Well, how can you be sure that the Sensorites will be
frightened of the dark? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Barbara, wouldn't you be afraid if you couldn't see
your enemies, hmm? Thank you for your admiration, dear boy. Thank you. <br>
IAN: I never said a word. <br>
DOCTOR: Telepathy. You know, telepathy isn't only a prerequisite of the
Sensorites. I know sometimes what you're thinking. <br>
SUSAN: Don't want to go. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear. What? <br>
BARBARA: They're talking to her again. <br>
IAN: What are they saying? <br>
SUSAN: Shh. I can't hear them very well. Oh, that's better. There's
just one voice a long way away. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what's the message, child? <br>
SUSAN: Oh. Oh, all right. But none of the others must be harmed. Don't
move, any of you. Grandfather, it was the only way. They knew I'd
agree. <br>

DOCTOR: Before we make this journey, one or two questions. <br>
SENSORITE 1: There's time. The craft has not arrived yet. <br>
DOCTOR: These discs you wear round your neck. You press them to your

SENSORITE 1: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Otherwise, you communicate as we do. <br>
SENSORITE 1: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Quite remarkable. Then you use telepathy to blanket
out the minds of the spaceship's crew, hmm? <br>
SUSAN: Gently, Grandfather. Don't antagonise them. <br>
DOCTOR: I merely want to know why you attacked Maitland and the others.
<br>
SENSORITE 1: Ten years ago, five human beings landed on the Sensphere.
Our planet welcomed them. Their minds were closed against us, although
we sensed they thought our planet was a rich one. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, rich in minerals, yes, quite. Go on. <br>
SENSORITE 1: Then the five men quarrelled. Two of the humans took off
in a ship. It exploded a mile in the atmosphere. <br>
BARBARA: What happened to the other three men? <br>
SENSORITE 1: We imagine they hid themselves aboard, then fought the
other two for control. Anyway, all were killed. <br>
IAN: Yes, but that still doesn't explain why you attacked Maitland and
the others. <br>
SENSORITE 1: Ever since that day of the explosion in the sky, our
people have been dying in greater numbers every year. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, some kind of disease I imagine, Chesterton. <br>
IAN: Maybe. <br>
BARBARA: Could be as simple as scarlet fever. <br>
SUSAN: And yet you're allowing us to visit your planet? <br>
SENSORITE 1: Our people are dying, and the First Elder says he senses
great knowledge in you. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha! I thought so. Yes, yes, yes, some kind of bargaining
ahead of us. <br>
SENSORITE 2: The craft is approaching. <br>
IAN: Well I suppose it's worth it, Doctor, if we get the lock of the
Tardis back. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, provided we can produce our side of the bargain. That's
the whole point of the issue. Well, my dear. Reluctant as I am to leave
you, I'm afraid we have no alternative. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, I shall be all right. I'm more worried about you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I shall manage. Come along my boy. Susan. <br>
IAN: Sorry about this, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: I keep telling you I shall be all right. <br>
IAN: All right. <br>
BARBARA: Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Yes? <br>
BARBARA: Look, I know how you feel, but your grandfather loves you. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, I know. <br>
BARBARA: Be patient. We're all on your side really, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: Susan. We can't do without you. Can we? <br>
IAN: Well, we're all ready now. <br>

2ND ELDER: The deaths of our people will increase. <br>
1ST ELDER: You cannot prove that. <br>
2ND ELDER: The deaths began at the time of the last visit of human
beings. Why should we welcomed to our planet the same creatures who
have been the means of our destruction. <br>
1ST ELDER: I am the ruler of this planet, am I not? <br>
2ND ELDER: Of course. <br>
1ST ELDER: Then what is the point of a ruler if he's not allowed to
rule? I have decided to invite these humans because I hope to use them
to end the deaths of our own people. <br>
2ND ELDER: But how? <br>
1ST ELDER: I will explain. Sometimes one must use fire to make fire. <br>
2ND ELDER: The First Elder makes a wise decision. In one degree I
confess I am anxious. These creatures, these Earth people, are loud and
ugly things. Why could we not have met them in the desert or in the
mountains? <br>
1ST ELDER: It is a failure of all beings that they judge through their
own eyes. To them, we may appear to be ugly. What we must create
between us is trust. That is why I have invited them to my palace. <br>
2ND ELDER: But are we sure these Earth creatures are beings as you say?
There are animals in the deserts and mountains, but we do not invite
them in to our palaces. Perhaps these Earth creatures are animals too? <br>
1ST ELDER: Do not underestimate them. Do we possess a spaceship that
can cross the barriers of the universe? And this small mechanism, which
my men brought to me, looks like an ordinary lock but in point of fact
is an electronic miracle which reveals a mind of science far beyond
ours. And this new arrival known as the Doctor. His mind was quick to
realise our weakness in the dark and use it against us, but, I would
remind you, not unfairly. Merely to protect the girl called Susan.
Well, and what does our city administrator say? <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Sir, you were elected to lead our people because of your
great brain. I would not dare to question your actions. <br>
1ST ELDER: No opinion can be worse sometimes than a very dogmatic one. <br>
(The First Elder leaves) <br>
2ND ELDER: You need not fear me. You may speak your mind. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I am cautious. You are his second opinion, yet he makes
his decisions without you. <br>
2ND ELDER: He makes a wise decision. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Based entirely upon trust. Do you trust these Earth
creatures? No more do I. <br>
2ND ELDER: The decision of the First Elder cannot be set aside. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I would not suggest such a thing. His mind is pure. We
are realists. That is why I have beamed the disintegrator to this room.
<br>
2ND ELDER: Without permission? You are presumptuous. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I am the city's administrator. It is my duty to protect
the one who rules. Can you say that these Earth creatures will not use
force? I am only guarding the First Elder. One suspicious act and the
disintegrator will destroy them. <br>
2ND ELDER: Very well. But you will do nothing further until I have
considered the matter. <br>

when he found that our planet contained a valuable ore that his mind
just opened up and shouted out the secret to us. <br>
DOCTOR: Molybdenum. <br>
1ST ELDER: That is correct. He thought of a fleet of spaceships to come
here and mine the metal and transport it back to his own planet. We saw
the pictures he formed in his mind, and we saw that it was the end of
our way of life. We had no alternative but to imprison him and his
friends in orbit round the Sensphere. <br>
IAN: Yes, but that's no reason for driving him out of his mind. <br>
1ST ELDER: Happened only, I assure you, because of his excitement. His
mind had no reserve, no defence. We caused the others to sleep, but he
heard the full power of our voices in his brain. Stop. Do not drink.
Why do you offer insult to our guests? Why do you not give them the
same food and drink that I am given? Who ordered this? The city

DOCTOR: Yes, well, I have to say, very comprehensive. Now, gentlemen,
time is not on our side. I believe your people have been dying because
there is atropine poison in the aqueduct water. Now, allow me. I've
made a few notes here which might interest you. Now these are the
symptoms. Atropine causes dilation of the blood vessels. Temperature
rises and pulse rate becomes very rapid. A rash may appear. The mouth
and throat both become extremely dry. Now what we have to do is this,
gentlemen. Isolate the poison and then prescribe the remedy. <br>
SCIENTIST 2: We give you our assistance. <br>

died. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, of course some may be able to resist it or perhaps some of
the water is good. <br>
SCIENTIST: But all the water is the same. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but surely from different outlets? <br>
SCIENTIST 2: There are ten districts in the city, but only one source. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, gentlemen, there's a poison at work here. I know the
signs. Now what you must do is to test samples from each and every
district. Where did that come from? <br>
SCIENTIST 2: This palace. It is district ten. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Well now, I suggest that you sample that bottle, and
mark it and then start keeping records. And there's not a moment to
lose. And remember, I want samples from all the outlying districts.
It's imperative. <br>
(And so the testing starts, as Ian becomes delirious. District after
district comes back negative for contaminants, until - ) <br>
DOCTOR: This one! I've found it. And just as I suspected, atropine
poison. That's why your people have been dying off. <br>

supply of the antidote you sent, Doctor, was intercepted by my Second
Elder, my advisor. He has since disappeared. <br>
SUSAN: We saw him in the courtyard. <br>
1ST ELDER: His behaviour is a mystery. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, strange indeed, sir. I tried to talk to him and he ran
away. <br>
IAN: Yes. You still won't accept that he's done something bad. <br>
1ST ELDER: I cannot. I selected him for office, but it is not pride
which makes me defend my choice. I know that Sensorite. I trust him. <br>
SUSAN: And yet you can't explain his actions. <br>
1ST ELDER: A mystery does not mean that he is guilty. <br>
(A Sensorite enters with a cloak) <br>
1ST ELDER: For the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear sir. That's most civil of you. I ruined my jacket down
in the aqueduct, but of course I have others on my ship. Thank you. <br>
SUSAN: Very smart. <br>
DOCTOR: Beau Brummell always said I looked better in a cloak. <br>

1ST ELDER: The City Administrator wishes to speak? <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Urgently, sir. A story has been put before me that you
should hear. <br>
1ST ELDER: Now? <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: It concerns the Second Elder and these Earth creatures. <br>
1ST ELDER: Very well. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Enter. <br>
(The Warrior and the Engineer enter) <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Tell your story. <br>
ENGINEER: Sir, the Second Elder is dead. He was killed in the
courtyard. I saw the man who killed him. <br>
1ST ELDER: The man? <br>
ENGINEER: Yes, sir. It was the man called the Doctor. <br>
SUSAN: That's not true! <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: The Senior Warrior here has evidence. Speak. <br>
WARRIOR: I met the Second Elder in the courtyard, as he ordered me to.
I gave him the firing key of the disintegrator. Then I saw the Doctor
go after the Second Elder. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I did that, but I didn't kill him. <br>
ENGINEER: I saw you. You wrestled for possession of the firing key. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: There is the firing key, bent as though in a struggle. <br>
ENGINEER: And finally, when the Second Elder resisted, you took an
object from inside your coat, and struck him down and killed him. <br>
1ST ELDER: This is a grave charge. <br>
IAN: But obviously untrue, sir. <br>
1ST ELDER: Why? <br>
IAN: How did you recognise the Doctor? <br>
ENGINEER: His hair is different. <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
ENGINEER: So are his clothes. <br>
IAN: Oh, yes, his clothes. You say that you saw him take an object from
his pocket. <br>
ENGINEER: Yes. <br>
IAN: You could see quite clearly? You're sure it was from his coat
pocket? <br>
ENGINEER: I tell you yes! All the Sensorites know the Doctor by his <br>

IAN: The Doctor's coat is outside the aqueduct. You are lying. <br>
ENGINEER: Then, then it was a cloak he was wearing! Yes, it was. I'm
sure of it now. It was a cloak. <br>
1ST ELDER: I have just presented the Doctor with that cloak. Your story
is a tissue of lies. Remove him. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I shall interview you myself. <br>
(The Warrior leads the Engineer away) <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Sir, you must forgive his wild accusation, but I felt
his story should be brought before you. <br>
1ST ELDER: You acted correctly. What can have possessed my advisor? <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: The Second Elder, sir, was always opposed to our
visitors. Perhaps he stole the firing key in order to attack them with
the disintegrator? <br>
SUSAN: I bet he stole our antidote too. He was our enemy. <br>
1ST ELDER: A sad matter. But since he has deceived us, my sympathy
shall not be wasted. As to his replacement. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I have his sash of office here, so that you may select a
new advisor immediately. <br>
IAN: Perhaps he ought not to look further than this room.<br>
SUSAN: Yes. If he thought he got promotion because of us, he'd be a
useful ally. <br>
DOCTOR: Just what I was thinking. Yes, of course, we have no wish to
interfere in your affairs, but the City Administrator appears to have
all the qualifications. <br>
1ST ELDER: Well, what do you say? Can you accept such power, such
authority? <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: My only ambition is to serve the Sensorite nation. <br>
1ST ELDER: Then accept this sash. I make you my advisor. From now on
you will be know as the Second Elder, second only on the Sensphere to
me. And once this order is made, only a betrayal of trust can set it
aside. <br>
(The Administrator takes of his neck band, and the First Elder puts the
sash on him. But I'll still call him Administrator) <br>
1ST ELDER: My new advisor and I have much to discuss. You will excuse
us? <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. My companions and I will pay a visit to the man
John, and note his progress. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, you were going to ask about Barbara. <br>
IAN: I don't think this is quite the moment. I'll ask later. <br>
SUSAN: All right. <br>

ADMINISTRATOR: He is a menace to our society. <br>
1ST ELDER: I agree. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Let him be punished. <br>
1ST ELDER: He shall be. We must also find who his accomplice is. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Ah. So you believe that another Sensorite is working
with him? <br>
1ST ELDER: Obviously. He had to guard the girl Carol. Who then
delivered the letter she was forced to write? <br>
(Susan and Barbara enter) <br>
1ST ELDER: What I cannot tolerate is accusation. I must have clear and
definite proof. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Yes, sir. Clear and definite proof. <br>
1ST ELDER: Come in, my friends. You have been questioning this
Sensorite who has acted so treacherously? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, and what he told us is terrifying. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Has he identified his accomplice? <br>
BARBARA: No. <br>
SUSAN: Not yet. <br>
BARBARA: But he did say that the maps and the guns given to the Doctor
and Ian are quite useless. <br>
1ST ELDER: Outrageous. This Sensorite will die for this. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, but what about Grandfather and Ian? <br>
1ST ELDER: What can I say? Lost and unarmed in the aqueduct. <br>
BARBARA: I'm afraid that answer isn't good enough. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Do not be insolent to the First Elder! <br>
BARBARA: Look, you must decide who your friends are, and save them. <br>
1ST ELDER: There is nothing I can do. <br>
BARBARA: Is there an authentic map to the aqueduct? <br>
1ST ELDER: Yes. <br>
BARBARA: Well, if Susan and I can find a way to rescue them, will you
help us? <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I am suspicious of these creatures, sir. They ask too
much. <br>
1ST ELDER: That other human being, the Doctor, he found a cure for our
people. He has placed his life in danger for the sake of the Sensorite
nation. Yes, I will give you all the help I can. </font></p>

yet. <br>
(Roaring sound) <br>
DOCTOR: Courage, my boy, both hands. Come on. <br>
IAN: Doctor. Something moved slightly up ahead of us. <br>
(The Doctor rolls up the map to make a club and gives it to Ian. He
sneaks up on something or someone but they get away) <br>
IAN: Doctor, it was a man! I know it was. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you sure? <br>
IAN: Yes. Look. This came away in the struggle. <br>
DOCTOR: It looks like a shoulder flash. I-N-E-E-R. Yes, just as I
suspected. It must be one of those survivors from the spaceship that
exploded. <br>
IAN: Why should they come here? <br>
DOCTOR: To hide and poison the water. <br>
IAN: Yes, but why poison the water in the first place. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go and ask him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Reception room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There's a scale model on a table) <br>
BARBARA: This is the entrance to the aqueduct. <br>
1ST ELDER: Yes. <br>
BARBARA: Tell me, do you think I could use one of your mind
transmitters? <br>
1ST ELDER: You have my permission to try. But how will it help you? <br>
BARBARA: John and I will go down to the aqueduct, Susan will stay here
and direct us. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, then we can guide them both out. <br>
1ST ELDER: My scientists tell me that you do not require the use of our
mind transmitter. <br>
SUSAN: Well, I've always been able to read your mind, but only when you
allowed me to. <br>
1ST ELDER: Your mind must be finely tuned. The frequencies covering the
surface of the Sensphere are numerous. You must be able to break in on
the major ones. <br>
BARBARA: Well I can't. Do you mind if I try your invention? <br>
1ST ELDER: Hold it to your forehead and try to close your mind to
everything but the person to whom you wish to communicate. It is safe
provided you do not allow your concentration to slip. <br>
BARBARA: All right. Susan, let's try a little experiment. <br>
SUSAN: Right. (a moment of telepathy) The entrance to the aqueduct is
there. <br>
BARBARA: It works. Well, there's no point in delaying. As soon as John
and I reach the entrance, you start directing us. All right? <br>
SUSAN: All right. Carol'll be here to help me. <br>
BARBARA: Good. Oh, by the way, I would like one of your warriors left
here with Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, one that you trust implicitly. <br>
1ST ELDER: I trust all Sensorites. You will be guarded safely. <br>
SUSAN: Thank you. Please find them, Barbara. <br>
(Barbara leaves) <br>
1ST ELDER: A very capable human being. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, she is. <br>
1ST ELDER: Gentle, yet with strong determination and courage. <br>
BOTH: I was going to <br>
SUSAN: I was going to say, why do you trust your people? <br>
1ST ELDER: Why do you want to make me doubt them? <br>
SUSAN: Trust can't be taken for granted. It must be earned. I trust
you, but only because I know you. <br>
1ST ELDER: But Susan, our whole life is based on trust. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, and that might be your downfall. Look you don't trust the
ground you walk on until you know it's firm, do you. So why trust your
people blindly? <br>
1ST ELDER: When I listen to you, you who are so young among your own
kind, I realise that we Sensorites have a lot to learn from the people
of Earth. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather and I don't come from Earth. Oh, it's ages since
we've seen our planet. It's quite like Earth, but at night the sky is a
burned orange, and the leaves on the trees are bright silver. <br>
1ST ELDER: My mind tells me that you wish to see your home again, and
yet there is a part of you which calls for adventure. A wanderlust. <br>
SUSAN: Yes. Well, we'll all go home some day. That's if you'll let us. <br>
1ST ELDER: I think I will. </font></p>

DOCTOR: No, no, my boy. No, no, no, no. I'm marking these, the
sections, the pipes. <br>
IAN: Uncanny. It's so quiet. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Perhaps they're preparing an ambush. <br>
IAN: You're a cheerful soul, I must say. <br>
DOCTOR: I assure you, dear boy, my spirits couldn't be higher.
Collecting evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, calculating it,
pursuing it until it's inevitable. It's fascinating. <br>
(Ian is staring at a bearded figure) <br>
IAN: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't interrupt, young boy. It's most irritating. <br>
(Then the Doctor sees a figure too) <br>
DOCTOR: Chesterton. <br>
IAN: I know. I've been trying to tell you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's all right. Let's back up and perhaps we can
jump out on them. <br>
(Then they realise they are caught between two people) <br>
IAN: You were right about the ambush, weren't you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Don't do anything to alarm them. <br>
MAN 1: (nearest the Doctor) You have come at last. <br>
DOCTOR: We came to find you. <br>
IAN: That's right. <br>
MAN 2; Watch them, Number One. <br>
MAN 1: We have been waiting for you. Are they all dead? <br>
DOCTOR: Dead? <br>
IAN: The Sensorites, you mean? <br>
MAN 1: Yes, the Sensorites. Do you have a spaceship? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
MAN 1: Are there more of you? <br>
IAN: No. <br>
MAN 2: No others in the channels at all? You haven't brought the
Sensorites with you? <br>
IAN: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Wouldn't you like to leave these tunnels and go out into the
sunshine again? <br>
MAN 1: No, they would hear our minds talking. Follow me. He is going to
talk to you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought there'd be a third. <br>
MAN 1: Yes, the Commander. You'll have to talk to him. Follow me. <br>

We're going to try and follow these marks, Susan. So instead of you
directing us, we'll tell you what route we're going to take. <br>
JOHN: Let's hope they were made by the Doctor, that's all.

COMMANDER: This is the best news I've had for a long time. (shakes
their hands) I'm very glad to see you both. Did you have a rough
journey? Yes, of course. I'm sure you must have done. Let's have
something to sit down on, Number One. <br>
MAN 1: Yes, sir. They're very rough quarters here. You'll have to
excuse that. But I'm sure you're both used to battle stations by now.
Yes. Excuse me. Number Two, you can take over ammunition detail now.
You'll find the new supplies all ready. Hide it in pipe number seven
this time. All right, carry on. <br>

COMMANDER: Number One? <br>
MAN 1: Yes, sir. <br>

MAN 1: Yes, sir. <br>
COMMANDER: Have to keep discipline up, you know. But they're all good
men. Very fine, Morale's very high here. Sit down. <br>
IAN: Well, you have a very well ordered base here, sir. <br>
COMMANDER: It's very good of you to say so. <br>
DOCTOR: We have a surprise for you. The war with the Sensorites is
over. <br>
COMMANDER: Is that true? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. <br>
COMMANDER: And the planet's ours now, is it? Completely? <br>
IAN: Completely. <br>
COMMANDER: Well, this is absolutely wonderful! We nearly lost, you
know. I had command of a fine spaceship, very fine. Two of my men
deserted, pretended they had to go back to Earth to get reinforcements.
<br>
DOCTOR: So you had to blow up your spaceship. <br>
COMMANDER: Yes. Still, I suppose I'll get another one. I'll be able to
afford it now. Planet's very rich <br>
IAN: Oh, yes. Molybdenum. <br>
COMMANDER: Oh, you know about that, do you? You do realise this war has
been fought by me and my men here. Any treasure trove is ours. <br>
DOCTOR: That's quite understandable, isn't it, Chesterton. <br>
COMMANDER: And I'm prepared to back that statement up with force, if
necessary. I have good supplies here. Loyal men. Of course, we're just
discussing this. But you are alone, aren't you. Hardly in a position to
fight me. And I have my men, and my organisation. <br>
MAN 1: Commander. Warning in route two. <br>
COMMANDER: What? Have you been telling me lies? You've brought other
people with you, haven't you? <br>
MAN 1: Perhaps they're really allies of the Sensorites. <br>
COMMANDER: No, Number One, not allies. Spies. The war isn't over at
all, is it. I thought it was a bit too good to be true. <br>
IAN: Now just a minutes. We knew nothing this warning system of yours <br>
COMMANDER: No, of course you didn't, and it's tripped you up, hasn't
it? Number One, there'll be a court martial. Immediately. Treason. <br>
IAN: Barbara! <br>
BARBARA: Ian. <br>
IAN: What on Earth are you doing here? <br>
(babble of greetings between the four) <br>
COMMANDER: What's this? Who are these people? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you misjudged us, sir. These people are part of the
committee, here to welcome you. We all came down here to take you out
again to the surface. <br>
IAN: To celebrate your success, sir. <br>
BARBARA: What's going on? <br>
IAN: Play it cool. <br>
COMMANDER: And who is this? <br>
IAN: This is our navigator. She is going to lead us back. <br>
COMMANDER: Well, I'm glad the fighting's over. Look forward to a bit of
a rest now for a while. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you deserve it, sir. So do your men. And I think the
sooner we take you out into the sunshine, the better. <br>
COMMANDER: Number One, assemble the men, please. We'll be leaving
immediately. It seems we have a victory to celebrate. You might pass on
my congratulations to the men, Number One. <br>

instructions) <br>

entrance, there. When they have all come through, you will step out and
prevent anyone from escaping back into the aqueduct. Now take your

others back to Earth. <br>
BARBARA: They were completely insane. They really believed they were at
war with you. <br>
1ST ELDER: At some time, they must have opened their minds, or
experimented with the mind transmitters. Every really rational thought
was crushed out, and all they had left was the game they played. The
game of war. <br>
BARBARA: What about the Second Elder? <br>
1ST ELDER: You finding the map proves his treachery. He will be
banished to the outer wastes. <br>
IAN: Well, I think we must go back to the ship, sir. <br>

SUSAN: They're coming. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter, my child? <br>
SUSAN: I had a talk with the senior Scientist just before we left. It
seems that the Sensphere has an extraordinary number of ultra high
frequencies, so I won't be able to go on using thought transference. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. It's rather a relief, I think. After all, no
one likes an eavesdropper about, do they. No, I think you obviously
have a gift in that direction. When we get home to our own place, I
think we should try and perfect it. <br>
SUSAN: When will we get back, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, my dear. This old ship of mine seems to be an
aimless thing. However, we don't worry about it, do we? Do you? <br>
SUSAN: Sometimes I feel I'd like to belong somewhere, not just be a
wanderer. Still, I'm not unhappy. <br>

IAN: Well, at least they know where they're going. <br>
DOCTOR: Implying I don't? <br>
IAN: I didn't mean anything <br>
DOCTOR: So, you think I'm an incompetent old fool, do you? <br>
IAN: Now, Doctor, I never said that. <br>
DOCTOR: Since you are so dissatisfied, my boy, you can get off the
ship. At the very next place we stop, I shall take you off myself, and
that is quite final. Carry on. </font></p>
