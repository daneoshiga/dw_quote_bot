VICKI: I shall miss them, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Who? <br>
VICKI: Ian and Barbara. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I shall miss them too. First Susan and now them. Come over
here, my dear, I'd like to talk to you. <br>
VICKI: What about the control panel? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's all right, my dear. It's already set. Their decision
certainly surprised me, although it shouldn't, I know. But it was quite
obvious they intended to take the first opportunity of going back home.
<br>
VICKI: Well, they weren't getting any younger, were they? <br>
DOCTOR: It's lucky for you child, they're not here to hear you say
that. Good gracious me. You think they're old? What do you think of me?
<br>
VICKI: You're different, Doctor. Anyway, we may land in their time one
day and be able to talk over old times. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps Vicki, perhaps. <br>
VICKI: Anyway, it's done now. I wonder where the Tardis'll take us
next? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's done now, although I must admit I'm left with a small
worry. <br>
VICKI: You know, I wouldn't mind New York. I didn't get to see a lot of
it, what with the Daleks and everything. But what I saw from the top of
the Empire State Building, I wouldn't mind going back there. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Vicki, I'm trying to talk to you. <br>
VICKI: Oh, sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: I just wanted to ask you, are you sure you didn't want to go
home too? I didn't give you very much time to consider now, did I? I
should hate to think that you're just staying for the sake of an old
man. <br>
VICKI: Oh, Doctor! I made my decision. I wanted to stay. Anyway, I
wouldn't have anything to go back to. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, your father <br>
(Rattle) <br>
VICKI: Did you hear that? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps it's something fallen down, or maybe we've changed
course. <br>
(Thump) <br>
VICKI: (sotto) There's someone in the living quarters. Doctor, be
careful. It's obviously a Dalek. <br>

open, and a
ragged man carrying a stuffed toy staggers out and falls on the floor.)

VICKI: We thought you were dead. <br>
STEVEN: Well, I nearly was. I just managed to climb down that cable
before it burned out. Then I came after you. <br>
VICKI: You should have shouted. <br>
STEVEN: Should have? I never stopped! Say, this is quite a ship you've
got here, Doc. Never seen anything like it. <br>
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, young man. Sit down. Now, there are two
things you can do. One, sit there until you get your breath back, and
two, don't call me Doc! Now do I make myself clear? <br>
STEVEN: Yes, yes, whatever you say, Doc-tor! <br>
DOCTOR: Apart from that young man, I'm quite willing to accept you at
your face value. <br>
VICKI: You were lucky to find the Tardis in all that jungle. <br>
STEVEN: Yeah, we were lucky. You know, I don't seem to remember much
about it. There was a door. I went through it. I must have flaked out.
I remember registering that, well, it didn't look like a ship. It was
very small. I must have been delirious. <br>
VICKI: I don't suppose you were. It is very small outside. It's just in
here it's big. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, come off it! <br>
VICKI: You don't believe me, do you? <br>
STEVEN: Oh, of course I do, Vicki. Every word. <br>
VICKI: This isn't an ordinary ship, you know. This is a time machine. <br>
STEVEN: Time? Look, this ship may have a way-out design, but time
machines? That's ridiculous. <br>
VICKI: Doctor? He says the Tardis isn't a time machine. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, does he now? <br>
VICKI: Tell him. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't see why I should, my child. He'll learn soon enough. <br>
STEVEN: Look, Doctor, I've seen some spaceships in my time, admittedly
nothing like this. Well, what does this do? <br>
DOCTOR: That is the dematerialising control and that, over yonder, is
the horizontal hold. Up there is the scanner, those are the doors, that
is a chair with a panda on it. Sheer poetry, dear boy. Now please stop
bothering me. <br>
STEVEN: Look, you gave this ship a name just now, what was it? <br>
VICKI: Tardis, T A R D I S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimensions
In Space. <br>
STEVEN: IDBI. <br>
VICKI: What? IDBI? <br>
STEVEN: I D B I. <br>
VICKI: Yes? <br>
STEVEN: It means I Don't Believe It. <br>
VICKI: You'll see, you'll see. <br>
DOCTOR: Vicki? <br>
VICKI: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: I've checked up on all the readings. Now I think our guest will
need a wash and brush up. So I think the best thing for you to do is go
and find him some clothes and a cloak. Bring mine as well. We'll show
him whether this is a time machine or not. <br>
VICKI: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, judging by the readings, my child, I think we've landed
on the planet Earth.

ELDRED: Wulnoth with you? <br>
EDITH: Inside. <br>
ELDRED: Something's landed on the beach. I saw it from the cliff. <br>
WULNOTH: What is it? <br>
ELDRED: A large box washed ashore by the tide, probably from a ship. I
didn't go down, I came for you. <br>
WULNOTH: What sort of box? <br>
ELDRED: I don't know. It's just very big. I've never seen anything like
it before. <br>
WULNOTH: The tide'll be turning. We must hurry. You lead the way. <br>
EDITH: It's a long way to the beach and back. What about your meal?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is examining a metal helm with horns
on) <br>
DOCTOR: Where did you say you found this, Vicki? <br>
VICKI: Just down there. I saw it as soon as I came out of the ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a bit rusted but, er, it's not as old as that. Tenth,
eleventh century? England. Well, there you are, young man. What do you
think of that now, eh? A Viking helmet. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, maybe. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, maybe? What do you think it is, a space
helmet for a cow? <br>
STEVEN: Look, it could just as easily be part of a costume. You know, a
toy left here by a child. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish, rubbish. <br>
STEVEN: No more so than your theory. Though your ship is, to say the
least, a little unusual. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see, so you've changed your idea's now. <br>
STEVEN: If it is a time machine, I'm not saying it is, mind you, but if
it is, shouldn't you know where we are? You know, your control panel? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, but unfortunately, we have a slight technical
hitch at the moment. Excuse me. <br>
VICKI: As a matter of fact, we never know where we're going to land
next. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, so assuming I believe what you tell me, you can't take me
home. <br>
VICKI: Not by any direct route. Let's go exploring now? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps we should find a village whereby we can convince
this young upstart of the true facts. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, great, Doctor. I'm all for that. But there is one thing
that bothers me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes? What is it now? <br>
STEVEN: Well, how come you chose such an unusual design for your ship?
A Police telephone box? Is that right? <br>
(The Monk is hiding behind a rock, listening to them) <br>
DOCTOR: The design is completely immaterial, young man. The Tardis is
required to land and blend in with its surroundings. <br>
STEVEN: Blend in? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, quite so. For instance, If we were to land in the middle
of the Indian mutiny, well, I'm sure the ship could possibly take on
the appearance of a howdah. <br>
STEVEN: How-what? <br>
DOCTOR: A Howdah! A carrier on the back of an elephant. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, I see. Oh, and, and if it landed on the pebbles/ <br>
DOCTOR: On the what? <br>
STEVEN: If it landed on the beach against the cliffs, it'd take on the
appearance of a large rock? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but you do keep on, don't you. <br>
STEVEN: Do you wonder why I don't believe you? You know, that large
rock over there looks exactly like a Police telephone box. <br>
VICKI: That is merely another technical hitch and the Doctor will
repair it one day. Anyway, if we're going to do any exploring we should
do it now, 'cos it's going to get dark in a minute. <br>
DOCTOR: Now I suggest we take a walk along the beach and try and find a
spot where the cliffs run down to sea level. <br>
STEVEN: Yeah, but that could be miles. It'd be much quicker to go up
here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so possibly it might, but I'm not a mountain goat and I
prefer walking to it any day, and I hate climbing! <br>
VICKI: We'll go with you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, you won't, you'll stay with the ship and wait 'til I've got
to the top then you can both climb up and join me. <br>
VICKI: But, Doctor, you might get <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not going to argue, my child. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, but. <br>
(The Doctor leaves) <br>
STEVEN: Oh, heck. <br>
VICKI: You might try being a bit more tactful in future <br>
STEVEN: Don't you start as well, come on, let's go up. <br>
VICKI: No, I think we should stay here and wait for him like the Doctor
said. <br>
STEVEN: Why? We've got to go up there sooner or later. It might as well
be sooner. We can walk along the top and meet. Hey, that bit there
looks climbable. Come on. <br>
VICKI: I'm not <br>
VICKI + STEVEN: very good on heights! <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, what's this? <br>
EDITH: Mead. <br>
DOCTOR: Mead? Oh, mead. Yes, of course, yes. Yes, how nice of you, yes.
Delightful, thank you, thank you. Well, here's to your very good
health. <br>
(The Doctor drinks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, delightful. Oh, yes, delightful. Tell me, is the monastery
near here? <br>
EDITH: No, it's not far from here. It's just at the top of the hill.
And when the winds in the right direction, you can hear the monks much
clearer, as though they're down in the village. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, quite understandable, you know.
Sounds do play funny tricks at times. <br>
EDITH: I, er, I hope you will forgive a woman's harsh welcome. We do
fear strangers but we're very happy to welcome a traveller. Not that we
see many in this wild place. I'm sure that when my husband returns,
he'll insist that you stay the night. And then you can rejoin your
friends in the morning. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's very kind, very kind indeed. And I do hope they
won't worry about me too much. You know, I hadn't intended to walk
quite so far. You are near the coast? <br>
EDITH: Yes. While there are fish in the sea, one need never starve. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. <br>
EDITH: Course, there are bad things, too. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, of course, of course, my dear. The Vikings, for example? <br>
EDITH: Not that we've seen much of them, this year. Except for that one
raid that was beaten off just north of here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I had heard about that battle, yes, yes. The King, er,
greatly improved the position no end. <br>
EDITH: The King? Harold Godwinson? We received no help from him. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, it seems like yesterday that the good King Edward was
laid to rest. When was it? <br>
EDITH: It was the beginning of the year. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, of course. Yes, yes, yes, the beginning of the year, yes,
yes, yes. How silly. Yes, it's most refreshing. <br>
EDITH: Oh, I'll get you more. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you, my dear. <br>
(Edith goes into the hut) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, if Harold is king, and Edward was laid to rest at the
beginning of the year, then it must be 1066! Yes. Judging by the
appearance of these leaves, late summer. And a balmy night, a balmy
night. <br>
(Edith returns) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, my dear. Thank you, thank you. Er, you know,
it's a bit stupid of me but, we are in Northumbria? <br>
EDITH: Yes, of course, we are. Why do you ask? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing, nothing, I just that I wasn't sure whether I'd
crossed the border or not. Yes, it's a bit tedious of me, isn't it? But
you must have patience with an old man. <br>
EDITH: Oh, please, sit down and rest before the fire. You must be tired
after your journey. Forgive me, I have things to do before Wulnoth
returns. <br>
DOCTOR: I will, I will, and thank you indeed. Thank you. Yes, it's a
great pity that Barbara isn't here. Now, if my memory of English
history serves me right, we're about to have a Viking invasion and very
soon. Now, let me think. Harold came north to defeat Hardrada, the
Norwegian King. Yes, now that was before he faced William the Conqueror
at Hastings. It's all very interesting. Yes, that's very, very, very,
very interesting. It's going to put that young man in his place. <br>
(The chanting slows down then suddenly gets back up to speed again) <br>
DOCTOR: Woman! Woman! Where are you? <br>
EDITH: What? What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: The monastery. Where is it, did you say? <br>
EDITH: Well, at the top of the hill. Why? What's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: The monks, have they been here long? <br>
EDITH: No, the monastery itself's been deserted for years and years and
then, several weeks ago, a few monks must have moved back in. <br>
DOCTOR: And you haven't seen them? No one in the village has? <br>
EDITH: One's been seen, but never spoken to. How does he know that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you've been very kind, and a great help, yes. I'm sorry,
but I must take my leave of you. <br>
EDITH: Are you going to the monastery? <br>

MONK: Because you're not wearing the right sort of clothes. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I see, I see. First, you want to open the door, then
you want the chance to reverse the position with the help of whoever it
is outside? Secondly, you want to get me into a monk's habit so that
whoever that is, would recognise me as an imposter. <br>
MONK: Dear me, dear me, what an untrusting nature you have, my son. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and you can drop the monk's act. <br>
MONK: I'm only trying to help. Whoever it is, it's probably as
traveller knocking for shelter. Who else could it be? Doctor, I must
remind you this is a monastery, a place of refuge, sanctuary. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VICKI: Is he coming out yet? <br>
STEVEN: Yes, yes, here he is. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, back. Elbow room, please. Now keep still. We're not out of
the wood yet. <br>
(He carefully pulls on the string and out comes the chosen component) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, there it is! I've done it, I've done it, I've done it. <br>
STEVEN: Well, nothing's happened, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hasn't it? Hasn't it, my dear boy? <br>
VICKI: Come on, aren't you going to tell us? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, sometime, my dear, sometime. Here, put that in your
pocket. Quite safe. <br>
(The Doctor puts a paper on top of the altar.)<br>
VICKI: Oh, is that the letter you wrote. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and <br>
VICKI: To the Monk. <br>
DOCTOR: Keep your hands off it, young lady. I don't want you nosing
into peoples personal and private correspondence. Gracious me. Well, I
think we've finished here. Now, lets go. <br>
STEVEN: Back to the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, certainly, back to the Tardis. Yes, come along. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: There it is, my dear. There's the Tardis.
Safe and sound. Didn't I tell you so? <br>
VICKI: Oh, am I glad to see that old police box again. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, glad indeed. Well, we must start climbing down the cliff
and get aboard as soon as we can. There's going to be an invasion
shortly. <br>
STEVEN: What? You mean any minute now the Viking fleet's going to sail
past here? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, my boy, yes. And history will be <br>
DOCTOR + VICKI: Allowed to take its natural course. <br>
STEVEN: You know, I'm beginning to like the idea of being a crew member
on a time machine. <br>
VICKI: A crew member? You'll be lucky. He's the crew. We're just the
passengers. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and both very welcome ones, my dear. Come along, come
along. Come on, come on. <br>
STEVEN: It's a heck of a way down. Wish we had a pair of wings.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Monk runs in, breathless, and bars the door) <br>
MONK: Oh. Oh, I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. It's
ridiculous. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Chapel]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MONK: Yes, I was right. They're gone. Well, I
suppose I'd better be on my way again too. <br>
(He sees the letter on the altar) <br>
MONK: The Doctor. (reads) My dear fellow, I'm sure will you excuse me
but I didn't want to say goodbye, as you are obviously going to be very
busy for some time. He's right there. Just in case you still idea's
about your master plan, I've taken precautions to stop your time
meddling. How could he stop a Mark 4? Possibly one day in the future,
when you've learnt your lesson, I shall return and release you. Release
me? Ha! Me? Oh, the old fool. I wonder what he meant by release me?
Well, I'll be going. <br>
(But he can't get in. His Tardis is now the size of the altar. It's no
longer bigger inside than outside.) <br>
MONK: Ah! Ah! What's he done? He's taken my dimensional control! He's
ruined my time machine! I'm, I'm marooned. Marooned! In 1066. Oh,
Doctor. Doctor! Doctor! <br>
(Down on the beach, the Tardis dematerialises.
