asteroids. It's female pilot has an injured co-pilot.)<br>
JOURNEY:
Aristotle, this is Wasp Delta, do you hear me? Stay with me, Kai. Stay
with me, please. Aristotle! We have been hit. Major damage.
Aristotle!<br>

opens her eyes to see the brass handles of the console. She sees the
Doctor and scrambles for her hand gun, and keeps it pointing at him.)<br>
DOCTOR: You'll probably feel a bit sick. Please, don't be.<br>
(The Doctor is holding a card tray with two takeaway coffees in it.)<br>
JOURNEY: Where's my brother?<br>
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor.<br>
JOURNEY: He was right beside me. Where's Kai? How did I get here?<br>
DOCTOR:
I materialised a time capsule exactly round you and saved your life one
second before your ship exploded, but do please keep crying.<br>
JOURNEY: My brother's just died.
<br>
DOCTOR: His sister didn't. You're very welcome. Put the gun down.
<br>
JOURNEY: Or what? <br>
DOCTOR: Or you might shoot me. Then where will you be?
<br>
JOURNEY: In charge of your vessel.
<br>
DOCTOR: You'd starve to death trying to find the light switch. Who are
you?<br>
JOURNEY:
I'm Lieutenant Journey Blue of the Combined Galactic Resistance. I
demand you take me back to my command ship, the Aristotle, which is
currently located
<br>
DOCTOR: No. Hey, not like that.
<br>
JOURNEY: You will take me back to my command ship,
which is currently positioned<br>
DOCTOR: No, no. Come on. Not like that. Not like that. Get it right<br>
(Journey lowers her gun.)<br>
JOURNEY: Will you take me back to my ship? Please?
<br>
DOCTOR: The Aristotle's the big fella parked in the asteroid belt,
yeah? <br>
(The Doctor sets the Tardis moving.)<br>
JOURNEY: It's shielded.<br>
DOCTOR: More or less. <br>
(The Aristotle is hiding by one edge of a long thin asteroid. Journey
opens the Tardis door.)<br>
DOCTOR<b>: </b>Dry your eyes, Journey Blue. Crying's for
civilians. It's how we communicate with you lot.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Med Sec 07]<br>
<br>
</b>(The Tardis has neatly parked
herself in a corner of a large section. There are pieces of metal
debris and a soldier is driving a small buggy in the background.)<br>
JOURNEY: It's smaller on the outside.<br>
DOCTOR: It's a bit more exciting when you go the other way. This isn't
a battleship. Medical insignia. It's a hospital.
<br>
(An older man with a greying beard speaks. He is backed up by armed
soldiers.)<br>
MORGAN: We don't need hospitals now. The Daleks don't leave any
wounded, and we don't take any prisoners.<br>
DOCTOR: I saved your little friend here, if that's in any way relevant
to mention. <br>
JOURNEY: That's true, sir. He did.
<br>
MORGAN: Thank you.<br>
DOCTOR: You're welcome. I wish I could've done more.
<br>
MORGAN: Then you should have. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay.<br>
MORGAN: But you did save Journey, and for that I am personally
grateful. <br>
DOCTOR: Well
<br>
MORGAN: However, the security of this base is absolute. So we're still
going to kill you.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a roller coaster with you, isn't it?
<br>
MORGAN: Shoot him, bag him and throw him outside. <br>
JOURNEY: No! Stop!
<br>
MORGAN: I'm sorry. He might be a duplicate.<br>
JOURNEY: He's a doctor. And we have a patient, don't we, Uncle?<br>
<br>
<b>[Corridor]</b><br>
<br>
DOCTOR: Why does a hospital need a doctor?<br>
MORGAN: The Aristotle wasn't always hidden. The Daleks got here before
us.<br>
JOURNEY: You don't like soldiers much, do you?
<br>
DOCTOR: You don't need to be liked. You've got all the guns.
<br>

(The soldiers stand guard at&nbsp;door 078.)<br>
DOCTOR: Wow! A moleculon nanoscaler.<br>
(A large clear tube with bench seats down the inside. A bit like a
decompression chamber for divers.)<br>
JOURNEY: You know what it does, then?
<br>
DOCTOR: It miniaturises living matter. What's the medical
application, though? Do you use it to shrink the surgeons so they can
climb inside the patients? <br>
MORGAN: Exactly.
<br>
DOCTOR: Fantastic idea for a movie. Terrible idea for a proctologist.
Are you going to miniaturise me?
<br>
MORGAN: You're a doctor, aren't you? <br>
(He opens a pair of secure doors further along.)<br>
MORGAN: And this is your patient.<br>
(A scratched eyepiece glows blue.)<br>
DOCTOR: No, you don't understand. You can't put me in there.
<br>
RUSTY: Doctor?<br>

dome.)<br>

DANNY: Dismissed.

SECRETARY: So, Mister Pink, did you have a good weekend?
<br>
DANNY: Yeah, I did, thanks. <br>
SECRETARY: Yeah, I'll bet you did. What did you get up to?
<br>
DANNY: Er, you know. A bit of reading.

that's all the questions on page 32, except the last one, and then
everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday. Any questions? <br>
FLEMING: Sir?
Have you ever killed a man?

(Groans from the rest of the class.)<br>
DANNY: I was a soldier.
There were other soldiers and some of them weren't on our side. I shall
leave the rest to your imagination.
And, please, think of another question?
<br>
FLEMING: Okay. Have you ever killed anyone who wasn't a soldier?
<br>
DANNY: Just to repeat, that's all the questions on page 32, except
the last one, and then everything on page 33. All that in for Thursday.

Oh, Beth, can I have a word?
<br>
BETH [OC]:&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, sure.
<br>
CLARA: Er, was it you that I saw outside doing the soldiery thing?
<br>
DANNY: Ah yeah, probably. The Coal Hill Cadets. Just a bit of fun.
<br>
CLARA: What, teaching them how to shoot people?
<br>
DANNY: There's a bit more to modern soldiering than just shooting
people. I like to think there's a moral dimension. <br>
CLARA: Ah, you shoot people then cry about it afterwards?
<br>
DANNY: Ah.
<br>
CLARA: Something wrong? <br>
DANNY: Nothing, no.
Sorry, no, nothing. I just.
I didn't think they'd say anything, that's all. <br>
CLARA: Sorry?
<br>
DANNY: Have they told everyone?
<br>
CLARA: No, no, no. As far as I know, nobody has told anybody anything.
What are you talking about?
<br>
DANNY: Why did you just say the crying thing?
<br>
CLARA: I was being funny. <br>
DANNY: Why?
<br>
CLARA: I just do that.

DANNY: Why? <br>
CLARA: I don't know.

DANNY: Anyway I, er, I've left some stuff in my class. <br>

and considered, without kindness or restraint.
Clara, be my pal and tell me, am I a good man?
