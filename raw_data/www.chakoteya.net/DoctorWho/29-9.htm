BAINES: Perhaps if that human heart breaks, the Time Lord will emerge. <br>
(Out of sight, Latimer takes the watch from his pocket, and opens it.
Golden energy shimmers and the Family turn their heads quickly.) <br>
VOICE: Time Lord. <br>
BAINES: It's him! <br>
(Latimer closes the watch. Martha gets the gun off Jenny and uses her
as a shield while she aims it at Baines.) <br>
MARTHA: All right! One more move and I shoot. <br>
BAINES: Oh, the maid is full of fire. <br>
MARTHA: And you can shut up! <br>
(She fires the gun at the ceiling.) <br>
CLARK: Careful, Son of Mine. This is all for you so that you can live
forever. <br>
BAINES: Shoot you down. <br>
MARTHA: Try it. We'll die together. <br>
BAINES: Would you really pull the trigger? Looks too scared. <br>
MARTHA: Scared and holding a gun's a good combination. Do you want to
risk it? <br>
(The family lower their guns. Joan returns to the Doctor.) <br>
MARTHA: Doctor, get everyone out. There's a door at the side. It's over
there. Go on. Do it, Mister Smith. I mean you. <br>
JOAN: Do what she said. Everybody out, now. Don't argue, Mister
Jackson. They're mad. That's all we need to know. Susan, Miss Cooper,
outside, all of you. <br>
(The villagers run out, screaming.)&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Move yourself, boy. Back to the school, quickly. <br>
MARTHA: And you. Go on. Just shift. <br>
DOCTOR: What about you? <br>
MARTHA: Mister Smith, I think you should escort your lady friend to
safety, don't you?

Family.) <br>
MARTHA: Don't try anything. I'm warning you, or Sonny boy gets it. <br>
BAINES: She's almost brave, this one. <br>
JENNY: I should have taken her form. Much more fun. So much spirit. <br>
(Martha backs away as the Family move forward.) <br>
MARTHA: What happened to Jenny? Is she gone? <br>
JENNY: She is consumed. Her body's mine. <br>
MARTHA: You mean she's dead. <br>
JENNY: Yes. And she went with precious little dignity. All that
screaming. <br>

BAINES: Get the gun! <br>

rubbish as a human. Come on! <br>

BAINES: Run! Ah, this is super. We've been in hiding for too long. This
is sport. <br>
JENNY: I can smell the schoolteacher. He's gone back to his academy. <br>
BAINES: And what do we know about her? <br>
(Jenny's body glows green.) <br>
JENNY: This body has traces of memory. Was once her friend. Martha
would go walking to the west. Husband of Mine, follow the maid's scent.
Go to the west. Find out what she was keeping secret. <br>
CLARK: Soldiers! <br>

BAINES: As for you, Mother of Mine, let's go to school.

grabs the bell and starts ringing it.) <br>
MARTHA: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe one man can't fight them, but this school teaches us to
stand together. Take arms! Take arms! <br>
MARTHA: You can't do that! <br>
DOCTOR: You want me to fight, don't you? Take arms! Take arms! <br>
HUTCHINSON: I say sir, what's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Enemy at the door, Hutchinson. Enemy at the door. Take arms!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BAINES: They're sounding the alarms. <br>
JENNY: I wouldn't be so pleased, Son of Mine. These bodies are silly
and hot. They can damage and die. That's why we need the Time Lord. <br>
BAINES: Indeed. They will have guns. Perhaps a little caution. Sister
of Mine, you're such a small little thing. Find a way in and spy on
them.

MARTHA: You can't do this, Doctor. Mister Smith! <br>
DOCTOR: Redfern, maintain position over the stable yard. Faster now.
That's it. <br>
MARTHA: They're just boys. You can't ask them to fight. They don't
stand a chance. <br>
DOCTOR: They're cadets, Miss Jones. They are trained to defend the King
and all his citizens and properties. <br>
(The Headmaster enters.) <br>
ROCASTLE: What in thunder's name is this? Before I devise an excellent
and endless series of punishments for each and every one of you, could
someone explain very simply and immediately exactly what is going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Headmaster, I have to report the school is under attack. <br>
ROCASTLE: Really? Is that so? Perhaps you and I should have a word in
private. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I promise you, sir. I was in the village with Matron. It's
Baines, sir. Jeremy Baines and Mister Clark from Oakham Farm. They've
gone mad, sir. They've got guns. They've already murdered people in the
village. I saw it happen. <br>
ROCASTLE: Matron, is that so? <br>
JOAN: I'm afraid it's true, sir. <br>
ROCASTLE: Murder on our own soil? <br>
JOAN: I saw it. Yes. <br>
ROCASTLE: Perhaps you did well then, Mister Smith. What makes you thing
the danger's coming here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, sir, they said <br>
JOAN: Baines threatened Mister Smith, sir. Said he'd follow him. We
don't know why. <br>
ROCASTLE: Very well. You boys, remain on guard. Mister Snell, telephone
for the police. Mister Philips, with me. We shall investigate. <br>
MARTHA: No! But it's not safe out there. <br>
ROCASTLE: Mister Smith, it seems your favourite servant is giving me
advice. You will control her, sir. <br>
(Rocastle and Philips leave.) <br>
MARTHA: I've got to find that watch.

hiding with the watch.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Hold me. Keep me safe. Keep me dark. Keep me closed. The
time is not right. Not yet. Not while the Family is abroad. Danger! <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROCASTLE: So. Baines and one of the cleaning staff.
There's always a woman involved. Am I to gather that some practical
joke has got out of hand? <br>
BAINES: Headmaster, sir. Good evening, sir. Come to give me a caning,
sir? Would you like that, sir? <br>
ROCASTLE: Keep a civil tongue, boy. <br>
PHILIPS: Now come on, everyone. I suspect alcohol has played its part
in this. <br>
(The Doctor watches from a window.) <br>
PHILIPS: Let's all just calm down. And who are these friends of yours,
Baines, in fancy dress? <br>
BAINES: Do you like them, Mister Philips? I made them myself. I'm ever
so good at science, sir. Look. <br>
(He pulls the arm off a scarecrow.) <br>
BAINES: Molecular fringe animation fashioned in the shape of straw men.
My own private army, sir. It's ever so good, sir. <br>
ROCASTLE: Baines, step apart from this company and come inside with me.
<br>
BAINES: No, sir. You, sir, you will send us Mister John Smith. That's
all we want, sir, Mister John Smith and whatever he's done with his
Time Lord consciousness. Then we'd be very happy to leave you alone. <br>
ROCASTLE: You speak with someone else's voice, Baines. Who might that
be? <br>
BAINES: We are the Family of Blood. <br>
ROCASTLE: Mister Smith said there had been deaths. <br>
BAINES: Yes, sir. And they were good, sir. <br>
ROCASTLE: Well, I warn you, the school is armed. <br>
BAINES: All your little tin soldiers. But tell me, sir, will they thank
you? <br>
ROCASTLE: I don't understand. <br>
BAINES: What do you know of history, sir? What do you know of next
year? <br>
ROCASTLE: You're not making sense, Baines. <br>
BAINES: 1914, sir. Because the Family has travelled far and wide
looking for Mister Smith and, oh, the things we have seen. War is
coming. In foreign fields, war of the whole wide world, with all your
boys falling down in the mud. Do you think they will thank the man who
taught them it was glorious? <br>
ROCASTLE: Don't you forget, boy, I've been a soldier. I was in South
Africa. I used my dead mates for sandbags. I fought with the butt of my
rifle when the bullets ran out, and I would go back there tomorrow for
King and Country! <br>
BAINES: Et cetera, et cetera. <br>
(Baines vapourises Philips.) <br>
BAINES: Run along, Headmaster. Run back to school. And send us Mister
Smith!

Smith. Can you tell me why? <br>
DOCTOR: Honestly, sir, I have no idea. And the telephone line's been
disconnected. We are on our own. <br>
ROCASTLE: If we have to make a fight of it, then make a fight we shall.
Hutchinson, we'll build a barricade within the courtyards. Fortify the
entrances, build our defences. Gentlemen, in the name of the King, we
shall stand against them. <br>
BOYS: Yes, sir! Right, come on. Let's get moving. <br>
(A wooden beam is put across the main doors.) <br>
BOY: Hurry, get back. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Barricade the kitchens. Secure the passageway to the
stables. <br>
(He drags Latimer out of his hiding place.) <br>

us.

<br>
MARTHA: I know it sounds mad, but when the Doctor became human, he took
the alien part of himself and he stored it inside the watch. It's not
really a watch, it just looks like a watch. <br>
JOAN: And alien means not from abroad, I take it. <br>
MARTHA: The man you call John Smith, he was born on another world. <br>
JOAN: A different species. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah. <br>
JOAN: Then tell me. In this fairy tale, who are you? <br>
MARTHA: Just a friend. I'm not. I mean, you haven't got a rival, as
much as I might. Just his friend. <br>
JOAN: And human, I take it? <br>
MARTHA: Human. Don't worry. And more than that, I just don't follow him
around. I'm training to be a doctor. Not an alien doctor, a proper
doctor. A doctor of medicine. <br>
JOAN: Well that certainly is nonsense. Women might train to be doctors,
but hardly a skivvy and hardly one of your colour. <br>
MARTHA: Oh, do you think? Bones of the hand. Carpal bones, proximal
row. Scaphoid, lunate, triquetal, pisiform. Distal row. Trapezium,
trapezoid, capitate, hamate. Then the metacarpal bones extending in
three distinct phalanges. Proximal, middle, distal. <br>
JOAN: You read that in a book. <br>
MARTHA: Yes, to pass my exams. Can't you see this is true? <br>
JOAN: I must go. <br>
MARTHA: If we find that watch, then we can stop them. <br>
JOAN: Those boys are going to fight. I might not be a doctor, but I'm
still their nurse. They need me. </font></p>

together. <br>
DOCTOR: Not quite as planned. <br>
JOAN: Tell me about Nottingham. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry? <br>
JOAN: That's where you were brought up. Tell me about it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it lies on the River Leen, its southern boundary
following the course of the River Trent which flows from Stoke to the
Humber. <br>
JOAN: That sounds like an encyclopaedia. Where did you live? <br>
DOCTOR: Broadmoor Street. Adjacent to Hotley Terrace in the district of
Radford Parade. <br>
JOAN: But more that facts. When you were a child, where did you play?
All those secret little places, the dens and hideaways that only a
child knows? Tell me, John. Please tell me. <br>
DOCTOR: How can you think that I'm not real? When I kissed you, was
that a lie? <br>
JOAN: No, it wasn't. No. <br>
DOCTOR: But this Doctor sounds like some, some romantic lost prince.
Would you rather that? Am I not enough? <br>
JOAN: No, that's not true. Never. <br>
DOCTOR: I've got to go. <br>
JOAN: Martha was right about one thing, though. Those boys, they're
children. John Smith wouldn't want them to fight, never mind the
Doctor. The John Smith I was getting to know, he knows it's wrong,
doesn't he? <br>

JOAN: Yes. Yes, he is. <br>
DOCTOR: Why can't I stay? <br>
MARTHA: But we need the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What am I, then? Nothing. I'm just a story. <br>
(The Doctor runs away and the women follow.) <br>
BAINES: One more phase and we won't have to hunt. The Doctor, Mister
Smith, the boy, the watch, they will come to us. Soldiers, guard this

JOAN: Er, the Cartwrights. That little girl at the school, she's Lucy
Cartwright, or she's taken Lucy Cartwright's form. If she came home
this afternoon and if the parents tried to stop their little girl, then
they were vanished. <br>
(Joan touches the teapot.) <br>
JOAN: Stone cold. How easily I accept these ideas. <br>
DOCTOR: I must go to them, before anyone else dies. <br>
JOAN: You can't. Martha, there must be something we can do. <br>
MARTHA: Not without the watch. <br>
DOCTOR: You're this Doctor's companion. Can't you help? What exactly do
you do for him? Why does he need you? <br>
MARTHA: Because he's lonely. <br>

LATIMER: It told me to find you. It wants to be held. <br>
JOAN: You've had this watch all this time? Why didn't you return it? <br>
LATIMER: Because it was waiting. And because I was so scared of the
Doctor. <br>
JOAN: Why? <br>
LATIMER: Because I've seen him. He's like fire and ice and rage. He's
like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun. <br>
DOCTOR: Stop it. <br>
LATIMER: He's ancient and forever. He burns at the centre of time and
he can see the turn of the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Stop it! I said stop it. <br>
LATIMER: And he's wonderful. <br>
JOAN: I've still got this. The journal. <br>
DOCTOR: Those are just stories. <br>

watch out, for but that wasn't included. <br>

DOCTOR: Falling in love? That didn't even occur to him? <br>
MARTHA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Then what sort of man is that? And now you expect me to die? <br>
MARTHA: It was always going to end, though! The Doctor said the
Family's got a limited lifespan, and that's why they need to consume a
Time Lord. Otherwise, three months and they die. Like mayflies, he
said. <br>
DOCTOR: So your job was to execute me. <br>
MARTHA: People are dying out there. They need him and I need him.
Because you've got no idea of what he's like. I've only just met him.
It wasn't even that long ago. But he is everything. He's just
everything to me and he doesn't even look at me, but I don't care,
because I love him to bits. And I hope to God he won't remember me
saying this. <br>
(A explosion close by.) <br>
LATIMER: It's getting closer. <br>
DOCTOR: I should have thought of it before. I can give them this. Just
the watch. Then they can leave and I can stay as I am. <br>
MARTHA: You can't do that! <br>
DOCTOR: If they want the Doctor, they can have him. <br>
MARTHA: He'll never let you do it. <br>
DOCTOR: If they get what they want, then, then <br>

those creatures would live forever to breed and conquer, for war across
the stars for every child. Martha, Timothy, would you leave us alone,
please? <br>

on the village continues as Martha and Latimer sit outside, then she
hugs him.) <br>
JOAN: If I could do this instead of you, then I would. I'd hoped. But
my hopes aren't important. <br>
DOCTOR: He won't love you. <br>
JOAN: If he's not you, then I don't want him to. I had one husband, and
he died. I never thought, ever again. And then you were so <br>

looking.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I think the explanation might be you've been fooled by a
simple olfactory misdirection. Little bit like ventriloquism of the
nose. It's an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy. But it
has got to be said, I don't like the looks of that hydroconometer. It
seems to be indicating you've got energy feedback all the way through
the retrostabilisers feeding back into the primary heat converters. Oh.
Because if there's one thing you shouldn't have done, you shouldn't
have let me press all those buttons. But, in fairness, I will give you
one word of advice. Run. <br>

BAINES [OC]: He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing. The
fury of the Time Lord. And then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who
had fought with gods and demons, why he'd run away from us and hidden.
He was being kind. <br>
(Clark, wearing heavy chains, falls into a pit.) <br>
BAINES [OC]: He wrapped my father in unbreakable chains, forged in the
heart of a dwarf star. He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a
collapsing galaxy to be imprisoned there forever. <br>
(Jenny is sucked out of the Tardis in deep space.) <br>
BAINES [OC]: He still visits my little sister once a year every year. I
wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is. Can you see?
He trapped her inside a mirror, every mirror. If ever you look at your
reflection and see something move behind you, just for a second, that's
her. That's always her. As for me, I was suspended in time. And the
Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England, as their
protector. <br>

did.
