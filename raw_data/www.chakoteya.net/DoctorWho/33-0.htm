phone call to the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Amy. Amy? Hello? Amy, it's me, the Doctor. Hello. Bit of a
situation. <br>
COMPUTER: Intruder alert. <br>
DOCTOR: I've got my finger on a button, which is fine, but as soon as I
take my finger off the button the spaceship is going to explode.
(Sparks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Argh. Which is good in one way, because the spaceship in
question is about to attack the Earth, but bad in another way, because
I'm on the spaceship and I'm going to get all smithereened. Now, plan.
I'm going to send you the coordinates so you can fly the Tardis here
and rescue me. Only three flaws in this plan as far as I can see. One,
I don't have the coordinates. Two, you can't fly the Tardis. Three, oh
dear, you're not even there. You left ages ago. Oh, well. I think I
just wanted a chat before all the smithereens. Merry Christmas, Amelia.

the crater in the field nearby. It contains an occupied spacesuit.) <br>

reveal a lot of hair.) <br>

MADGE: Cyril, what are you doing awake? <br>
(His older sister is also in her night clothes.) <br>
LILY: It's the moon's fault, apparently. It's too interesting. <br>
CYRIL: It's astronomy. <br>
LILY: Don't make up words. He's always making up things and breathing. <br>
MADGE: Where's your father? <br>
CYRIL: In the garden. <br>
MADGE: What's he doing in the garden? <br>
CYRIL: Agriculture. <br>
LILY: You're not fooling anyone. <br>
MADGE: Listen, Cyril. Tell him that I've borrowed Mister Goldsmith's
car. That I found a spaceman in a field, possibly an angel, but he's
injured and I can't get his helmet off, so I'm having to take him into
town to find a police telephone box, all right? <br>
CYRIL: All right. <br>

the car by gently running into a wooden bollard.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! Did we just bump into something? <br>
MADGE: No, no. <br>
DOCTOR: We seemed to bump into quite a lot of things. <br>
MADGE: Well, a lot of things get in the way. It's hardly my fault. You
need to take that silly thing off. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't. Impact suit. It's still repairing me. <br>
MADGE: Repairing you? <br>
(She helps him out of the car.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, you know, that's the idea. <br>
MADGE: Won't it repair you all back to front? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No. <br>
MADGE: Well, that's good. Oh, that's a street lamp. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I got that impression. <br>
MADGE: Round this way. Don't you want me to take you to hospital or
something? You're welcome to come to our house. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I'm fine. I just need to find the, er, the key. <br>
MADGE: Do you want me to do it with a pin? I'm good with a pin. <br>

DOCTOR: Multi-dimensional, triple encoded temporal interface. Not
really susceptible to pointy things. <br>
MADGE: Got it. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Suddenly the last nine hundred years of time travel seem
that bit less secure. Thank you for taking care of me. You didn't have
to, you know. You've been very kind. <br>
MADGE: Oh, don't be silly. It's Christmas Eve. No one should be alone
at Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: What did you say your name was? <br>
MADGE: Madge. Madge Arwell. <br>
DOCTOR: If thre's anything that I can do for you, let me know. <br>
MADGE: How? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Make a wish. That usually works. <br>
MADGE: Does it? <br>
DOCTOR: It did for me. You're here, aren't you? Well, don't wait around
here. Just off you go home. I'll just go and, and wait inside here. <br>

LILY: For Christmas, like he always does. Now, hurry up and think of
something. <br>
CYRIL: But we're going to Uncle Digby's house. Will he be there? <br>
LILY: He will, won't he, mother? Daddy will be there. <br>
MADGE: Of course he will. <br>

MADGE: Oh, this is no good. Where's Mister Cardew? He was supposed to
be here. <br>
(Madge goes to knock on the door.) <br>
CYRIL: Maybe it's haunted by the ghost of Uncle Digby. <br>
LILY: Uncle Digby is still alive. He's in a home in Battersea. <br>
MADGE: Mister Cardew! <br>
CYRIL: But why do we have to come here? <br>
LILY: Because of the bombing, stupid. <br>
CYRIL: I like the bombing. It's exciting. <br>
LILY: Will Father be here? Well, he will, won't he? You said he'd meet
us at the house. <br>
MADGE: He'll be here. Of course he will. You don't need to keep asking

ultimate bedroom. A sciencey wiencey workbench. A jungle. A maze. A
window disguised as a mirror. A mirror disguised as a window. Selection
of torches for midnight feasts and secret reading. Zen garden,
mysterious cupboard, zone of tranquillity, rubber wall, dream tank,
exact model of the rest of the house, not quite to scale. Apologies.
Dolls with comical expressions, the Magna Carta, a foot spa, Cluedo, a
yellow fort. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, I couldn't fit everything in. There had to be sacrifices.

DOCTOR: Hammocks! I know. <br>
CYRIL: But how do you get on? <br>
DOCTOR: Watch and learn, kid. <br>

hammocks.) <br>

MADGE: Yes. No. I don't know. Just please go downstairs! <br>
LILY: You don't need to shout. <br>

MADGE: Why are you doing all this? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm just trying to take care of things. I'm the caretaker. <br>
MADGE: That's not what caretakers do. <br>
DOCTOR: Then why are they called caretakers? <br>
MADGE: Their father's dead. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. <br>
MADGE: Lily and Cyril's father, my husband, is dead and they don't know
yet, because if I tell them now, then Christmas will always be what
took their father away from them, and no one should have to live like
that. Of course, when the Christmas period is over, I shall. I don't
know why I keep shouting at them. <br>
DOCTOR: Because very time you see them happy, you remember how sad
they're going to be, and it breaks your heart. <br>
LILY [OC]: Mother, come and see! <br>
CYRIL: Mother! You've got to see this! <br>
DOCTOR: Because what's the point in them being happy now if they're
going to be sad later. <br>
CYRIL [OC]: Mother. <br>
LILY [OC]: Mother, are you coming? <br>
DOCTOR: The answer is, of course, because they are going to be sad
later. Now, we'd better get downstairs. I think they may have found the
main sitting room. <br>

have a look. <br>
LILY: Go to sleep. <br>

out of the room. She hears noises and sees lights from the Doctor's
wing of the house and goes to investigate. Then Cyril comes out of the
room with a torch.)

DOCTOR: Famous last words. <br>
LILY: Why have you got a phone box in your room? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not a phone box, it's my wardrobe. I've just painted it to
look like a phone box. <br>
LILY: Well, what are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Rewiring. <br>
LILY: Why would you rewire a wardrobe? <br>
DOCTOR: Have you seen the way I dress? <br>
LILY: Who are you? Really, who are you? <br>

DOCTOR: Your brother, where is he? <br>
(Cyril is downstairs, untying the big present. He opens the box and
light streams out, along with some snowflakes. He crawls inside and
looks out on a snow covered forest. The box is suspended off the
ground. He backs out into the main sitting room as Lily looks into
their room.) <br>
LILY: Still in bed, asleep. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Faulty, then. <br>
(Cyril summons up his courage and goes into what is definitely Not
Narnia because he didn't get there through the back of a wardrobe. A
nearby tree grows some big glass baubles. He picks one, and it gets
bigger in his hand. He drops it and it grows again, then begins to
crack. Cyril runs back through the box. The Doctor's alarm beeps
again.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're sure he's still in bed? <br>

hatched and gone, leaving tracks.)

Cyril! <br>

LILY: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: In a forest, in a box, in a sitting room. Pay attention. He's
about twenty minutes ahead. <br>
LILY: But we just saw him. <br>
DOCTOR: Time moves differently across the dimensional planes. What do
they teach you in schools these days? <br>
LILY: But I don't understand where we are. <br>
DOCTOR: We've gone through a dimensional portal thingy. <br>
LILY: Well, what's that supposed to be? Where did it come from? <br>
DOCTOR: It was a present, and it wasn't supposed to be opened till
Christmas Day. Honestly, who opens their Christmas presents early?
Okay. Shut up. Everyone. <br>
(The forest whispers. <br>
Further ahead, the tracks Cyril is following are getting larger and
larger.) <br>
LILY: I don't understand. Is this place real, or is it fairyland? <br>
DOCTOR: Fairyland? Oh, grow up, Lily. Fairyland looks completely
different. Now, these are Cyril's footprints, and these are the ones he
was following. Notice anything? <br>
LILY: The other footprints are getting bigger. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Whatever your brother's following, it's growing. <br>
LILY: Well, we have to get after him. <br>
(Lily runs forward, brushing against a tree and knocking some of its
snow off. It grows baubles.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's okay, you're fine. Don't worry. <br>
LILY: Is that tree alive? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course it's alive. It's a tree. <br>
LILY: But is it dangerous? <br>
DOCTOR: Every rose has its thorns. <br>
LILY: They're like Christmas tree decorations. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Naturally occurring Christmas trees. How cool is that? <br>
LILY: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a big universe. Everything happens somewhere. Call it a
coincidence. Call it an idea echoing among the stars. Personally, I
call it a brilliant idea for a Christmas trip. Or it should've been. Do
you know the difference between wind and trees talking to each other? <br>
LILY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: No wind. I've been here many times, but I've never heard the
trees so active. Something's wrong. What are you doing? What are you up
to? <br>
(The Doctor looks at a bauble and his reflection turns into the image
of a wooden man.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Lily, I really am, but there is something very wrong
in this forest, and your brother's right in the middle of it.

no floors, just a staircase around the walls, and he can see all the

starts to walk up the stairs. The wooden

what Cyril was following. The growing thing. Hatched from a bauble on a
tree. Grew to this size in less than an hour, I'd say. Impressive. And
so is this building. Yes. It's grown, see. This building, it isn't a
building. It's a group of trees grown in the shape of a building.
Disguised as a building. Ooo, clever. I love. Clever, clever old

LILY: Because it's a trap? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Thing about people, we can never resist a door. <br>
LILY: So this is a trap. What, we've just walked straight into a trap? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(More like a field, a bit rough and overgrown.) <br>
DOCTOR: No stars to light the way, Madge? There was one. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bomber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR [OC]: There was you. <br>
CO-PILOT: What is it? <br>
REG: I don't know, but it's all we've got. We can follow it. <br>
(And he does, through the Time Vortex.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lawn]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Madge Arwell, who flew a whole forest
though the Time Vortex, plus one husband. <br>
(The Bomber has landed safely.) <br>
DOCTOR: He did it again, Madge. He followed you home. Look what you can
do, Mother Christmas. <br>
REG: Madge, what am I doing here? <br>
MADGE: It's Christmas Day, my love! Where else would you be? <br>
REG: Christmas Day? How? <br>
MADGE: We took a short cut. <br>
(Big family reunion.) <br>
LILY + CYRIL: Daddy! <br>
DOCTOR: Happy crying. Humany wumany.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Attic]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Down in the main sitting room, the happy family
are doing a jigsaw in front of a roaring fire. Later, Madge comes into
the attic and sees the Tardis. The Doctor comes out of it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
MADGE: Of course. It's you, isn't it? My spaceman angel, with his head
on backwards. <br>
DOCTOR: How do I look the right way round? <br>
MADGE: Funnier. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. <br>
MADGE: So you came back. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you were there for me when I had a bad day. Always like
to return a favour. Got a bit glitchy in the middle there, but it sort
of worked out in the end. Story of my life. <br>
MADGE: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you did it all yourself, Madge Arwell. But thanks for
thanking me. <br>
MADGE: Now, the last time I saw you, I went back the next day, but the
police box had gone. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. You want to see how it's done? <br>
MADGE: No. I want you to stay for Christmas, please. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, you see, things to do, people to see. <br>
MADGE: Of course. Yes. Family of your own. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no, actually. <br>
MADGE: Oh. Yes, yes, you said no family. But there must be people who
love you. Friends. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Well, yes, but. It's a long story. But they all think I'm
dead. Never mind. Anyway, watch my box do its thing. It's really cool.
You'll love it. <br>
MADGE: No. No one should be alone at Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm fine. I don't mind. I'm really very good at being <br>
MADGE: I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about your friends. You
can't let them think that you're dead. Not at Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: It's complicated. Very complicated. It's far too complicated to
explain right now. <br>
MADGE: You must tell them. At once. Off you go. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Mum. I'll think about it. <br>
(He kisses her on the cheek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, eyes on the box. <br>
MADGE: Oh, Caretaker? What if I require you again? <br>
DOCTOR: Make a wish. <br>
(He goes into the Tardis and it dematerialises as Reg comes in.) <br>
REG: What the hell was that? <br>
MADGE: That was just the Caretaker returning to the Time Vortex. It's a
lovely place. I've been there myself. Shall we go downstairs?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Front door]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor knocks on a blue suburban front door
with a yale lock.) <br>
AMY [OC]: Argh! If that is more carol singers, I have a water pistol!
You don't want to be all wet on a night like this. <br>
(She opens the door and squirts the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not absolutely sure how long <br>
AMY: Two years? <br>
(Squirt, squirt, squirt.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Fair point. <br>
AMY: So, you're not dead. <br>
DOCTOR: And a happy New Year! <br>
AMY: River told us. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course she did. <br>
AMY: She's a good girl. Well? I'm not going to hug first. <br>
DOCTOR: Nor am I. <br>
(They spend a few moments not looking at each other before laughing and
hugging.) <br>
AMY: Mister Pond! Guess who's coming for dinner? <br>
RORY: Whoa. Not dead, then. <br>
AMY: We've done that. <br>
RORY: Oh. <br>
AMY: We're about to have Christmas dinner. Joining us? <br>
DOCTOR: If it's no trouble. <br>
RORY: There's a place set for you. <br>
DOCTOR: But you didn't know I was coming. Why would you set me a place?
<br>
AMY: Oh, because we always do. It's Christmas, you moron. <br>
RORY: Come on. <br>
(Amy and Rory go inside. The Doctor hesitates, then feels his face. It
is wet with happy tears.)</font> </p>
