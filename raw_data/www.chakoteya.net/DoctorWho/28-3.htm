the Headmaster's office]</b>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A man comes down the stairs of Deffry Vale High
School and walks to the Headmaster's office. A girl is sitting on a
chair nearby.) <br>
FINCH: What do you want? <br>
NINA: The nurse sent me, sir. I was in English and I got a headache. <br>
FINCH: Then don't bother me, go home. <br>
NINA: I can't. <br>
FINCH: Why, is your mother at work? <br>
NINA: I live in Ambrose Hall. The children's home. <br>
FINCH: No parents. No one to miss you. I see why the nurse sent you.
You poor child. Poor thin, child. Come inside. <br>
(He opens the door and the girl walks through.) <br>
FINCH: It's nearly time for lunch. <br>
(The door closes behind them. There is a screech and flapping of wings,
and a scream.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Physics laboratory]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Up on the first floor, there is a change of class.
The teacher enters, wearing a brown suit and white sneakers.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good morning, class. Are we sitting comfortably? <br>
(The Doctor writes on the board.) <br>
DOCTOR: So, physics. Physics, eh? Physics. Physics. Physics! Physics.
Physics, physics, physics, physics, physics, physics, physics. I hope
one of you is getting all this down. Okay let's see what you know. Two
identical strips of nylon are charged with static electricity and hung
from a string so they can swing freely. What would happen if they were
brought near each other? <br>
(A young boy with spectacles puts his hand up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, er, what's your name? <br>
MILO: Milo. <br>
DOCTOR: Milo! Off you go. <br>
MILO: They'd repel each other because they have the same charge. <br>
DOCTOR: Correctamundo! A word I have never used before and hopefully
never will again. Question two. I coil up a thin piece of microwire and
place it in a glass of water. Then I turn on the electricity and
measure to see if the water's temperature is affected. My question is
this. How do I measure the electrical power going into the coil? <br>
(Just one hand goes up. Everyone else looks totally bored.) <br>
DOCTOR: Someone else. No? Okay, Milo, go for it. <br>
MILO: Measure the current and PDs in an ammeter and a voltmeter. <br>
DOCTOR: Two to Milo. Right then, Milo, tell me this. True or false. The
greater the dampening of the system, the quicker it loses energy to its
surroundings. <br>
MILO: False. <br>
DOCTOR: What is non-coding DNA? <br>
MILO: DNA that doesn't code for a protein. <br>
DOCTOR: Sixty five thousand nine hundred and eighty three times five? <br>
MILO: Three hundred and twenty nine thousand nine hundred and fifteen. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you travel faster than light? <br>
MILO: By opening a quantum tunnel with an FTL factor of thirty six
point seven recurring. <br>
(The Doctor's jaw drops.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Chips are still on the menu here. A young blonde
slops mash into the Doctor's tray. He walks away with a grin. A little
later she goes over to wipe his table.) <br>
ROSE: Two days. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, could you just? There's a bit of gravy. No, no, just,
just there. <br>
ROSE: Two days, we've been here. <br>
DOCTOR: Blame your boyfriend. He's the one who put us onto this. And he
was right. Boy in class this morning, got a knowledge way beyond planet
Earth. <br>
ROSE: You eating those chips? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, they're a bit different. <br>
ROSE: I think they're gorgeous. Wish I had school dinners like this. <br>
DOCTOR: It's very well behaved, this place. <br>
ROSE: Mmm. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought there'd be happy slapping hoodies. Happy slapping
hoodies with ASBOs. Happy slapping hoodies with ASBOs and ringtones.
Huh? Huh? Oh, yeah. Don't tell me I don't fit in.<br>
(The head dinner lady comes over.) <br>
JACKSON: You are not permitted to leave your station during a sitting. <br>
ROSE: I was just talking to this teacher. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
ROSE: He doesn't like the chips. <br>
JACKSON: The menu has been specifically designed by the headmaster to
improve concentration and performance. Now, get back to work. <br>
ROSE: See? This is me. Dinner lady. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll have the crumble. <br>
ROSE: I'm so going to kill you. <br>
(A dark teacher walks over to a girl with a pony tail.)&nbsp;<br>
WAGNER: Melissa. You'll be joining my class for the next period. Milo's
failed me, so it's time we moved you up to the top class. Kenny, not
eating the chips? <br>
(Tubby Kenny is eating a home prepared lunch from a Tupperware box.) <br>
KENNY: I'm not allowed. <br>
WAGNER: Luke. Extra class. Now. <br>
(Luke and Melissa follow Mister Wagner out. Headmaster Finch stands on
a balcony overlooking the canteen and watches it all.)

large cooking oil drum through. It has lots of strange symbols on the
side. They are wearing breathing masks and heavy duty protective
gauntlets.) <br>
JACKSON: Careful. Keep it steady. Don't spill a drop. I said, keep it
steady. Careful. That's it. Easy now. Steady. <br>
(Rose's phone rings.) <br>
JACKSON: Right. Second barrel. Quickly now! <br>

ROSE: I thought maybe you called me home just, well, just to call me
home. <br>
MICKEY: Do you think I'd just invent an emergency? </font></p>

and starts screaming.) <br>

the blinds are pulled down. Rose redials.) <br>

ROSE: Calling an ambulance. <br>
JACKSON: No need. She's quite all right. <br>
(There is a whumph! like a sudden fire, and a scream.) <br>
JACKSON: It's fine. She does that. <br>

now, please. Now, children, the things you will see. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Finch is talking to a not quite so young woman
investigative reporter, who hasn't changed her hairstyle in thirty
years.) <br>
FINCH: Our work here. My improvements aren't confined to the classroom.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We've introduced a new policy. School dinners
are absolutely free, but compulsory. Do try the chips. <br>
SARAH: Oh, I'd love to. Thank you. And it's got to be said, the
transformation you've brought about is amazing. I mean, maybe you're
working the children a little bit too hard now and then, but I think
good results, they're more important than anything. <br>
FINCH: Exactly. You're a woman of vision, Miss Smith. <br>
SARAH: Oh, I can see everything, Mister Finch. Quite clearly. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Staff room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PARSONS: Yesterday, I had a twelve year old girl
give me the exact height of the Walls of Troy in cubits. <br>
DOCTOR: And, it's ever since the new headmaster arrived? <br>
PARSONS: Finch arrived three months ago. Next day, half the staff got
flu. Finch replaced them with that lot, except for the teacher you
replaced, and that was just plain weird, her winning the lottery like
that. <br>
DOCTOR: How's that weird? <br>
PARSONS: She never played. Said the ticket was posted through her door
at midnight. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. The world is very strange. <br>
(The Headmaster enters.) <br>
FINCH: Excuse me, colleagues. A moment of your time. May I introduce
Miss Sarah Jane Smith. Miss Smith is a journalist who's writing a
profile about me for the Sunday Times. I thought it might be useful for
her to get a view from the trenches, so to speak. Don't spare my
blushes. <br>
(Finch leaves.) <br>
SARAH: Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I should think so. <br>
SARAH: And, you are? <br>
DOCTOR: Hm? Er, Smith. John Smith. <br>
SARAH: John Smith. I used to have a friend who sometimes went by that
name. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a very common name. <br>
SARAH: He was a very uncommon man. Nice to meet you. <br>
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you. Yes, very nice. More than nice. Brilliant. <br>
SARAH: Er, so, er, have you worked here long? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Er, it's only my second day. <br>
SARAH: Oh, you're new, then. So, what do you think of the school? I
mean, this new curriculum? So many children getting ill. Doesn't that
strike you as odd? <br>
DOCTOR: You don't sound like someone just doing a profile. <br>
SARAH: Well, no harm in a little investigation while I'm here. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Good for you. <br>
(Sarah moves away from the scary grinning Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good for you. Oh, good for you, Sarah Jane Smith. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The end of day bell rings. Kenny walks into the
now dark room to investigate a strange sort of eating sound. A nasty
large set of teeth snap at him from behind a row of computer screens,
then the teacher stands up.) <br>
WAGNER: This isn't your classroom, Kenny. Now run along. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(After dark, Sarah Jane Smith breaks into the
school.) <br>
ROSE: Oh, it's weird seeing school at night. It just feels wrong. When
I was a kid, I used to think all the teachers slept in school. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, team. Oh, I hate people who say team. Er, gang. Er,
comrades. Anyway, Rose, go to the kitchen. Get a sample of that oil.
Mickey, the new staff are all Maths teachers. Go and check out the
Maths department. I'm going to look in Finch's office. Be back here in
ten minutes. <br>
(The Doctor leaves.) <br>
ROSE: You going to be all right? <br>
MICKEY: Me? Please. Infiltration and investigation? I'm an expert at
this. <br>
(Mickey leaves, then comes back.) <br>
MICKEY: Where's the Maths department? <br>
ROSE: Down there, turn left, through the fire doors, on the right. <br>
MICKEY: Thank you. <br>
(Sarah Jane chases something flying in an upper corridor. Rose gets the
oil sample as instructed, then looks up as something screeches
overhead.)

Tardis parked inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Sarah Jane. <br>
SARAH: It's you. Oh, Doctor Oh, my God, it's you, isn't it. You've
regenerated. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Half a dozen times since we last met. <br>
SARAH: You look incredible. <br>
DOCTOR: So do you. <br>
SARAH: Huh. I got old. What are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, UFO sighting, school gets record results. I couldn't
resist. What about you? <br>
SARAH: The same. I thought you'd died. I waited for you and you didn't
come back, and I thought you must have died. <br>
DOCTOR: I lived. Everyone else died. <br>
SARAH: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Everyone died, Sarah. <br>
SARAH: I can't believe it's you. <br>
(Mickey screams.) <br>
SARAH: Okay, now I can! <br>
(Rose runs up.) <br>
ROSE: Did you hear that? Who's she? <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane, Rose. <br>
SARAH: Hi. Nice to meet you. You can tell you're getting older. Your
assistants are getting younger. <br>
ROSE: I'm not his assistant. <br>
SARAH: No? Get you, tiger. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MICKEY: Sorry! Sorry, it was only me. You told me
to investigate, so I started looking through some of these cupboards
and all of these fell on me. <br>
ROSE: Oh, my God, they're rats. Dozens of rats. Vacuum packed rats. <br>
DOCTOR: And you decided to scream. <br>
MICKEY: It took me by surprise! <br>
DOCTOR: Like a little girl? <br>
MICKEY: It was dark! I was covered in rats! <br>
DOCTOR: Nine, maybe ten years old. I'm seeing pigtails, frilly skirt. <br>
ROSE: Hello, can we focus? Does anyone notice anything strange about
this? Rats in school? <br>
SARAH: Well, obviously they use them in Biology lessons. They dissect
them. Or maybe you haven't reached that bit yet. How old are you? <br>
ROSE: Excuse me, no one dissects rats in school anymore. They haven't
done that for years. Where are you from, the dark ages? <br>
DOCTOR: Anyway, moving on. Everything started when Mister Finch
arrived. We should go and check his office. </font></p>

exactly are you? <br>

ROSE: Oh. Well, he's never mentioned you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I must've done. Sarah Jane. Mention her all the time. <br>
ROSE: Hold on. Sorry. Never. <br>

MICKEY: Come on? You've got to be kidding! <br>

K9 Mark Three to be precise. <br>
ROSE: Why does he look so disco? <br>
DOCTOR: Oi! Listen, in the year five thousand, this was cutting edge.
What's happened to him? <br>
SARAH: Oh, one day, he just, nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, didn't you try and get him repaired? <br>
SARAH: Well, it's not like getting parts for a Mini Metro, Beside, the
technology inside him could rewrite human science. I couldn't show him
to anyone. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooh, what's the nasty lady done to you, eh? <br>

SARAH: And Rose? <br>
DOCTOR: She was there too. <br>
SARAH: Did I do something wrong, because you never came back for me.
You just dumped me. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you. I was called back home and in those days humans
weren't allowed. <br>
SARAH: I waited for you. I missed you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you didn't need me. You were getting on with your life. <br>
SARAH: You were my life. You know what the most difficult thing was?
Coping with what happens next, or with what doesn't happen next. You
took me to the furthest reaches of the galaxy, you showed me
supernovas, intergalactic battles, and then you just dropped me back on
Earth. How could anything compare to that? <br>
DOCTOR: All those things you saw, do you want me to apologise for that?
<br>
SARAH: No, but we get a taste of that splendour and then we have to go
back. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at you, you're investigating. You found that school.
You're doing what we always did. <br>
SARAH: You could have come back. <br>
DOCTOR: I couldn't. <br>

K9: Oil. Ex ex ex extract. Ana ana analysing. <br>
MICKEY: Listen to him, man. That's a voice. <br>
SARAH: Careful. That's my dog. <br>
K9: Confirmation of analysis. Substance is Krillitane Oil. <br>
DOCTOR: They're Krillitanes. <br>
ROSE: Is that bad? <br>
DOCTOR: Very. Think of how bad things could possibly be, and add
another suitcase full of bad. <br>
SARAH: And what are Krillitanes? <br>
DOCTOR: They're a composite race. Just like your culture is a mixture
of traditions from all sorts of countries, people you've invaded or
have been invaded by. You've got bits of Viking, bits of France, bits
of whatever. The Krillitanes are the same. An amalgam of the races
they've conquered. But they take physical aspects as well. They cherry
pick the best bits from the people they destroy. That's why I didn't
recognise them. The last time I saw Krillitanes, they looked just like
us except they had really long necks. <br>

humans, sometimes they're aliens, and sometimes they're tin dogs. What
about you? Where do you fit in the picture? <br>

DOCTOR: As opposed to what? <br>
ROSE: I thought you and me were. I obviously got it wrong. I've been to

never even mention her. Why not? <br>

die. Imagine watching that happen to someone who you <br>
ROSE: What, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend
the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse
of the Time Lords. <br>

flies off.) <br>

FINCH: My name is Brother Lassa. And you? <br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor. Since when did Krillitanes have wings? <br>
FINCH: It's been our form for nearly ten generations now. Our ancestors
invaded Bessan. The people there had some rather lovely wings. They
made a million widows in one day. Just imagine. <br>
DOCTOR: And now you're shaped human. <br>
FINCH: A personal favourite, that's all. <br>
DOCTOR: And the others? <br>
FINCH: My brothers remain bat form. What you see is a simple morphic
illusion. Scratch the surface and the true Krillitane lies beneath. And
what of the Time Lords? I always thought of you as such a pompous race.
Ancient, dusty senators, so frightened of change and chaos. And of
course, they're all but extinct. Only you. The last. <br>
DOCTOR: This plan of yours. What is it? <br>
FINCH: You don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: That's why I'm asking. <br>
FINCH: Well, show me how clever you are. Work it out. <br>
DOCTOR: If I don't like it, then it will stop. <br>
FINCH: Fascinating. Your people were peaceful to the point of
indolence. You seem to be something new. Would you declare war on us,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm so old now. I used to have so much mercy. You get one
warning. That was it. <br>
FINCH: But we're not even enemies. Soon you will embrace us. The next
time we meet, you will join with me. I promise you.

you've got control of the building blocks of the universe. Time and
space and matter, yours to control. <br>
ROSE: What, and the kids are like a giant computer? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. And their learning power is being accelerated by the oil.
That oil from the kitchens, it works as a, as a conducting agent. Makes
the kids cleverer. <br>

DOCTOR: What's fifty nine times thirty five? <br>
ROSE: Two thousand and sixty five. Oh, my God. <br>
SARAH: But why use children? Can't they use adults? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's got to be children. The God maker needs imagination to
crack it. They're not just using the children's brains to break the
code, they're using their souls. <br>
(The Headmaster has entered the room.) <br>

solved, reality becomes clay in our hands. We can shape the universe
and improve it. <br>

Call me old fashioned, but I like things as they are. <br>

preserve the old order? Think of the changes that could be made if this
power was used for good. <br>

FINCH: No, someone like you. The Paradigm gives us power, but you could
give us wisdom. Become a God at my side. Imagine what you could do.
Think of the civilisations you could save. Perganon, Assinta. Your own
people, Doctor, standing tall. The Time Lords reborn. <br>
