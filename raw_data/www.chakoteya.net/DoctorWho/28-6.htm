because I can't be bothered to type up the whole recap section - the
Doctor points the recharging Tardis power cell at the Cybermen, who get
bent backwards then atomised by the golden energy.) <br>
RICKY: What the hell was that? <br>
DOCTOR: We'll have that instead. Run! <br>
(Mrs Moore sounds the van's horn.) <br>
MOORE: Everybody, in! <br>
PETE: I've got to go back. My wife's in there. <br>
DOCTOR: Anyone inside that house is dead. If you want to help, then
don't let her die for nothing. You've got to come with us right now. <br>
MOORE: Come on! Get a move on! <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, she's not your mother. <br>
ROSE: I know. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
MOORE: Finished chatting? Never seen a slower getaway in my life! <br>

Inside, Jackie peers round of the cellar door to see Cybermen nearby.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RICKY: What was that thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Little bit of technology from my home. <br>
MICKEY: It's stopped glowing. Has it run out? <br>
DOCTOR: It's on a revitalising loop. It'll charge back up in about four
hours. <br>
RICKY: Right. So, we don't have a weapon anymore. <br>
JAKE: Yeah, we've got weapons. Might not be one of those metal things,
but they're good enough for men like him. <br>
ROSE: Leave him alone. What's he done wrong? <br>
JAKE: Oh, you know, just laid a trap that's wiped out the Government
and left Lumic in charge. <br>
PETE: If I was part of all that, do you think I'd leave my wife inside?
<br>
RICKY: Maybe your plan went wrong. Still gives us the right to execute
you, though. <br>
DOCTOR: Talk about executions, you'll make me your enemy. And take some
really good advice. You don't want to do that. <br>
RICKY: All the same, we have evidence that says Pete Tyler's been
working for Lumic since twenty point five. <br>
ROSE: Is that true? <br>
RICKY: Tell them, Mrs M. <br>
MOORE: We've got a government mole who feeds us information. Lumic's
private files, his South American operations, the lot. Secret
broadcasts twice a week. <br>
PETE: Broadcast from Gemini? <br>
RICKY: And how do you know that? <br>
PETE: I'm Gemini. That's me. <br>
RICKY: Yeah, well you would say that. <br>
PETE: Encrypted wavelength six five seven using binary nine. That's the
only reason I was working for Lumic. To get information. I thought I
was broadcasting to the Security Services. What do I get? Scooby Doo
and his gang. They've even got the van. <br>
MICKEY: No, no, no. But the Preachers know what they're doing. Ricky
said he's London's Most Wanted. <br>
RICKY: Yeah, that's not exactly <br>
MICKEY: Not exactly what? <br>
RICKY: I'm London's Most Wanted for parking tickets. <br>
PETE: Great. <br>
RICKY: Yeah, they were deliberate. I was fighting the system. Park
anywhere, that's me. <br>
DOCTOR: Good policy. I do much the same. I'm the Doctor, by the way, if
anyone's interested. <br>
ROSE: And I'm Rose. Hello. <br>
PETE: Even better. That's the name of my dog. Still, at least I've got
the catering staff on my side. <br>
ROSE: I knew you weren't a traitor. <br>
PETE: Why is that, then? <br>
ROSE: I just did. <br>
PETE: They took my wife. <br>
ROSE: She might still be alive. <br>
PETE: That's even worse. Because that's what Lumic does. He takes the
living and he turns them into those machines. <br>
DOCTOR: Cybermen. They're called Cybermen. And I'd take those ear pods
off, if I were you. You never know. Lumic could be listening. <br>
(The Doctor zaps the ear pods with his sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: But he's overreached himself. He's still just a businessman.
He's assassinated the President. All we need to do is get to the city
and inform the authorities. Because I promise you, this ends tonight. </font></p>

it feel? <br>
CYBERMAN: We feel nothing. <br>
LUMIC: But in your mind, what do you think? <br>
CYBERMAN: We think the same. We are uniform. <br>
LUMIC: But you think of what? <br>
CYBERMAN: We think of the humans. We think of their difference and
their pain. They suffer in the skin. They must be upgraded. <br>
LUMIC: Excellent. Then let's begin. Computer, identify John Lumic. <br>
COMPUTER: Voice print acknowledged. <br>
LUMIC: Activate ear pod primary sequence. <br>
COMPUTER: Please state area of activation. <br>
LUMIC: The City of London. I've just declared Independence. Begin

(In a pedestrianised area, a Cybus download signal sounds and everyone
stops moving. Jackie
receives it too in the cellar. She walks past the Cyberman and out of
the cellar.) <br>
LUMIC: You will come to me, my dear children. The Immortal Ones. <br>
REPORTER [on TV]: All of London has been sealed off. There are reports
of an army. An army of metal men. All citizens should remove their ear
pods. I repeat, remove all ear pods. London has been placed under
martial law. If you're hearing this, stay in your homes. I repeat, stay

ROSE: Can't we just, I don't know, take them off? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't! Cause a brainstorm. Human race. For such an intelligent
lot, you aren't half susceptible. Give anyone a chance to take control
and you submit. Sometimes I think you like it. Easy life. <br>
JAKE: Hey, Come and see. <br>
(Around the corner are more people, and a squad of Cybermen.) <br>
ROSE: Where are they all going? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Lumic must have a base of operations. <br>
PETE: Battersea. That's where he was building his prototypes. <br>
ROSE: Why's he doing it? <br>
PETE: He's dying. This all started out as a way of prolonging life, of
keeping the brain alive at any cost. <br>
ROSE: The thing is, I've seen Cybermen before, haven't I? The head.
Those handle shapes in Van Statten's museum. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, there are Cybermen in our universe. They started on an
ordinary world just like this, then swarmed across the galaxy. This lot
are a parallel version, and they're starting from scratch right here on
Earth. <br>
PETE: What the hell are you two on about? <br>
RICKY: Never mind that. Come on, we need to get out of the city. Okay,
split up. Mrs Moore, you look after that bloke. Jake, distract them. Go

I apologise. If I, er, might? I'd like to request an upgrade, sir. I've
seen the future, and it's copyright Cybus Industries. Sign me up. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, I'll think of something. <br>
MICKEY: You're just making this up as you go along. <br>
DOCTOR: Yep. But I do it brilliantly. <br>
(Later, Mrs Moore has joined them and is using her Cybus Industries
laptop.) <br>
MOORE: That's a schematic of the old factory. Look. Cooling tunnels
underneath the plant. Big enough to walk through <br>
DOCTOR: We go under there and up into the control centre? <br>
MOORE: Mmm. <br>
PETE: There's another way in. Through the front door. If they've taken
Jackie for upgrading, that's how she'll get in. <br>
JAKE: We can't just go strolling up. <br>
MOORE: Or we could, with these. Fake ear pods. Dead. No signal. But put
them on, the Cybermen would mistake you for one of the crowd. <br>
PETE: Then that's my job. <br>
DOCTOR: You'd have to show no emotion. None at all. Any sign of emotion
would give you away. <br>
ROSE: How many of those you got? <br>

ROSE: We haven't got time. Doctor, I'm going with him, and that's that.
<br>
DOCTOR: No stopping you, is there? <br>
ROSE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell you what. We can take the ear pods at the same time. Give
people their minds back so they don't walk into that place like sheep.
Jakey-boy? Lumic's transmitting the control signal. It must be from
over there. <br>
(He waves his sonic screwdriver in the direction of the power station.
The Zeppelin is parked on top, with a circle of red lights blinking on
its bow, or stern.) <br>
DOCTOR: There it is. On the zeppelin, you see? Great big transmitter.
Good thing Lumic likes showing off. Reckon you could take it out? <br>
JAKE: Consider it done. <br>
DOCTOR: Mrs Moore, would you care to accompany me into the cooling
tunnels? <br>
MOORE: How could I refuse an offer of cooling tunnels? <br>
DOCTOR: We attack on three sides. Above, between, below. We get to the
control centre, we stop the conversion machines. <br>

DOCTOR: Mickey. You can er <br>
MICKEY: What, stay out of trouble? Be the tin dog? No, those days are

MOORE: Oh, my God. It's alive. It can feel. <br>
DOCTOR: We broke the inhibitor. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. <br>

DOCTOR: Can you remember your name? <br>
CYBERMAN: Sally. Sally Phelan. <br>
MOORE: You're a woman. <br>
CYBERMAN: Where's Gareth? <br>
MOORE: Who's Gareth? <br>
CYBERMAN: He can't see me. It's unlucky the night before. <br>
MOORE: You're getting married. <br>
CYBERMAN: I'm cold. I'm so cold. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. You sleep now, Sally. Just go to sleep. <br>
(He puts the sonic screwdriver inside the chest cavity and switches her
off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sally Phelan didn't die for nothing, because that's the key.
The emotional inhibitor. If we could find the code behind it, the
cancellation code, then feed it throughout the system into every
Cyberman's head, they'd realise what they are. <br>
MOORE: And what happens then? <br>
DOCTOR: I think it would kill them. Could we do that? <br>
MOORE: We've got to. Before they kill everyone else. There's no choice,
Doctor. It's got to be done. <br>
(Mrs Moore stands up. A Cyberman grabs her shoulder and electrocutes
her.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! No, you didn't have to kill her! <br>
CYBERMAN: Sensors detect a binary vascular system. You are an unknown
upgrade. You will be taken for analysis. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Yeah, but that's it. That's exactly the point! Oh, Lumic,
you're a clever man. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. But
everything you've invented, you did to fight your sickness. And that's
brilliant. That is so human. But once you get rid of sickness and
mortality, then what's there to strive for, eh? The Cybermen won't
advance. You'll just stop. You'll stay like this forever. A metal Earth

this planet so alive. People. Ordinary, stupid, brilliant people. <br>

DOCTOR: It's not yours to take. You're a Cyber Controller. You don't
control me or anything with blood in its heart. <br>
