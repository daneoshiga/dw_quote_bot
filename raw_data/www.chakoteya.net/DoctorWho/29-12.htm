followed by the Doctor, Jack and Martha.) <br>

JACK: I'm telling you, it's broken. It hasn't worked for years. <br>
DOCTOR: That's because you didn't have me. Martha, grab hold, now! <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JACK: The moral is, if you're going to get stuck at
the end of the universe, get stuck with an ex-Time Agent and his vortex
manipulator. <br>
MARTHA: But this Master bloke, he's got the Tardis. He could be
anywhere in time and space. <br>
DOCTOR: No, he's here. Trust me. <br>
MARTHA: Who is he, anyway? And that voice at the end, that wasn't the
Professor. <br>
JACK: If the Master's a Time Lord, then he must have regenerated. <br>
MARTHA: What does that mean? <br>
JACK: It means he's changed his face, voice, body, everything. New man.
<br>
(A beggar is tapping the rhythm of the start of the old Who theme on
his tin mug. Di di di
dum di di di dum.) <br>
MARTHA: Then how are we going to find him? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll know him, the moment I see him. Time Lords always do. <br>
MARTHA: But hold on. If he could be anyone, we missed the election. But
it can't be. <br>

the news.) <br>
NEWSREADER [on screen]: Mister Saxon has returned from the Palace and
is greeting the crowd inside Saxon Headquarters. <br>
(The new Prime Minister is walking down steps with his wife.) <br>
MARTHA: I said I knew that voice. When he spoke inside the Tardis. I've
heard that voice hundreds of times. I've seen him. We all have. That
was the voice of Harold Saxon. <br>
DOCTOR: That's him. He's Prime Minister. <br>
PHOTOGRAPHER [on screen]: Mister Saxon, this way, sir. Come on, kiss
for the lady, sir. <br>

his wife? </font></p>

MASTER: A glorious day. Downing Street rebuilt, the Cabinet in session.
Let the work of government begin. <br>
(He throws the files he has just been given into the air.) <br>
MASTER: Oh, go on. Crack a smile. It's funny, isn't it? Albert, funny?
No? Little bit? <br>
DUMFRIES: Very funny, sir. But if we could get down to business, there
is the matter of policy, of which we have very little. <br>
MASTER: No, no, no, no. Before we start all that, I just want to say
thank you. Thank you, one and all. You ugly, fat faced bunch of wet,
snivelling traitors. <br>
DUMFRIES: Yes, quite, very funny. But I think <br>
MASTER: No. No, that wasn't funny. You see, I'm not making myself very
clear. Funny is like this. <br>
(Big grin, wide eyes.) <br>
MASTER: Not funny is like this. <br>
(Deep scowl and frown.) <br>
MASTER: And right now, I'm not like (grin) I'm like (frown) because you
are traitors. Yes, you are! As soon as you saw the vote swinging my
way, you abandoned your parties and you jumped on the Saxon bandwagon.
So this is your reward. <br>
(The Master puts on an oxygen mask.) <br>
DUMFRIES: Excuse me, Prime Minister. Do you mind my asking, what is
that? <br>
MASTER: (muffled) It's a gas mask. <br>
DUMFRIES: I beg your pardon? <br>
MASTER: It's a gas mask. <br>
DUMFRIES: Yes, but, er, why are you wearing it? <br>
MASTER: (muffled) Well, because of the gas. <br>
DUMFRIES: I'm sorry? <br>
MASTER: Because of the gas. <br>
DUMFRIES: What gas? <br>
MASTER: (muffled) This gas. <br>
(The conference telephone sets pop up and squirt gas at the Cabinet and
officials.) <br>
DUMFRIES: You're insane! <br>

JACK: Just some friends of mine, but there's no reply. <br>
(Martha fetches her laptop.) <br>
MARTHA: Here you go. Any good? <br>
JACK: I can show you the Saxon websites. He's been around for ages. <br>
MARTHA: That's so weird though. It's the day after the election. That's
only four days after I met you. <br>

piece on the man himself. Oh, come on, sweetheart. You must've read it.
<br>
TISH: Not really. Sorry, I'm new. <br>
VIVIEN: Mister Saxon does like a pretty face, but I'm here to see Mrs

LUCY: Oh, can't I just have an hour to myself? It's been a hell of a
day. <br>
VIVIEN: Oh, strike while the iron's hot, that's what I say, Lucy. I can
call you Lucy, can't I? Now, everyone's talking about Harold Saxon, but
I thought, What about the wife? All I need is twenty minutes. <br>
LUCY: Oh, I think maybe we should wait. <br>

can leave us alone. <br>

VIVIEN: Mrs Saxon, I have reason to believe that you're in very great
danger. All of us, in fact. Not just the country, but the whole world.
No, I beg of you, hear me out. <br>

JACK: Former Minister of Defence. First came to prominence when he shot
down the Racnoss on Christmas Eve. Nice work, by the way. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thanks. <br>
MARTHA: But he goes back years. He's famous. Everyone knows his story.
Look. Cambridge University, Rugby blue. Won the Athletics thing. Wrote
a novel, went into business, marriage, everything. He's got a whole
life. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VIVIEN: All of it. The school days, his degree,
even his mother and father, it's all invented. Look, Harold Saxon never
went to Cambridge. There was no Harold Saxon. The thing is, it's
obvious. The forgery is screaming out and yet no one can see it. It's
as if he's mesmerized the entire world. <br>
LUCY: I think perhaps you should leave now. <br>
VIVIEN: Eighteen months ago, he became real. This is his first, honest
to God appearance, just after the downfall of Harriet Jones. And at the
exact same time, they launched the Archangel Network. <br>
LUCY: Mrs Rook, now stop it. <br>
VIVIEN: Even now they've said that the Cabinet has gone into seclusion.
I mean, what does that mean, seclusion? <br>
LUCY: How should I know? <br>
VIVIEN: But I've got plenty of research on you. Yes, good family,
Roedean, not especially bright but essentially harmless. And that's why
I'm asking you, Lucy. I am begging you. If you have seen anything,
heard anything, even the slightest thing that would give you cause to
doubt him? <br>
LUCY: I think <br>
VIVIEN: Yes? <br>
LUCY: There was a time when we first met, I wondered. But he was so
good to my father, and he said. <br>
VIVIEN: What? Just tell me, sweetheart. <br>

LUCY: For better or for worse. Isn't that right, Harry? <br>
MASTER: My faithful companion. <br>
VIVIEN: Mister Saxon. Prime Minister, I was just having a little joke
with poor little Lucy. I didn't mean. <br>

in on Vivien and she screams. After a few moments, the Master opens the
door again but the scream is continuing. He shuts it then opens it once
more. Still screaming.) <br>
LUCY: Oh, but she knew. Harry, she knew everything. You promised. You
said Archangel was one hundred percent. <br>
MASTER: Ninety nine, ninety eight? <br>
LUCY: But if she's asking questions, then who else? How much time have
we got? <br>

JACK: But he's got the Tardis. Maybe the Master went back in time and
has been living here for decades. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
JACK: Why not? Worked for me. <br>
DOCTOR: When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I could do was
fuse the coordinates. I locked them permanently. He can only travel
between the year one hundred trillion and the last place the Tardis
landed. Which is right here, right now. <br>
JACK: Yeah, but a little leeway? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, eighteen months, tops. The most he could have been here
is eighteen months. So how has he managed all this? The Master was
always sort of hypnotic, but this is on a massive scale. <br>
MARTHA: I was going to vote for him. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>
MARTHA: Well, it was before I even met you. And I liked him. <br>
JACK: Me too. <br>
DOCTOR: Why do you say that? What was his policy? What did he stand
for? <br>
MARTHA: I don't know. He always sounded good. <br>
(She starts tapping the rhythm.) <br>
MARTHA: Like you could trust him. Just nice. He spoke about. I can't
really remember, but it was good. Just the sound of his voice. <br>

That's how he hid himself from me, because I should have sensed there
was another Time Lord on Earth. I should have known way back. The

WINTERS: Since Britain elected an ass, yes. I'll see you onboard the
Valiant. <br>
MASTER: It still will be televised, though, won't it. Because I
promised, and the whole world is watching. <br>
WINTERS: Since it's too late to pull out, the world will be watching.
Me. <br>
(The President walks to his motorcade.) <br>
MASTER: The last President of America. We have a private plane ready
and waiting. We should reach the Valiant within the hour. My darling. <br>
(Lucy leaves with her security guard. The Master turns and looks in the
rough direction of our trio. A Police van arrives and the Master runs
over to it. Clive and Francine are bundled out.) <br>
MASTER: Ha ha ha! Hi, guys! <br>
CLIVE: You can't just do this. <br>
MASTER: All will be revealed. <br>
MARTHA: Oh my God. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't move. <br>
MARTHA: But the <br>
DOCTOR: Don't. <br>
(Clive and Francine are pushed into a Range Rover Vogue.) <br>
MARTHA: I'm going to kill him. <br>
JACK: What say I use this perception filter to walk up behind him and
break his neck? <br>
DOCTOR: Now that sounds like Torchwood. <br>
JACK: Still a good plan. <br>
DOCTOR: He's a Time Lord, which makes him my responsibility. I'm not
here to kill him. I'm here to save him. <br>
JACK: Aircraft carrier Valiant. It's a UNIT ship at fifty eight point
two north, ten point oh two east. <br>
MARTHA: How do we get on board? <br>
DOCTOR: Does that thing work as a teleport? <br>
JACK: Since you revamped it, yeah. Coordinates set. <br>

JACK: I've has worse nights. Welcome to the Valiant. <br>
MARTHA: It's dawn? Hold on, I thought this was a ship. Where's the sea?
<br>
JACK: A ship for the twenty first century, protecting the skies of
planet Earth. <br>

helipad. See Gerry Anderson's 'Captain Scarlet' for more details.)

from South America. And keep tracking Japan. <br>
(Lucy and the Master arrive in the lift. The actual ship's bridge is on
a raised area at the far end of the large area. Cameras are stationed
at the side and there is a big glass conference table and chairs in the
middle. One of the pieces of equipment on the bridge is a large
circular item with engraving like the fob watch.) <br>
WINTERS: I want the whole thing branded in my suit of office, not the
UN. You got that? <br>
WOMAN: This material is being transmitted prior to transmission. <br>
MASTER: Anything I can do? I could make the tea, or isn't that American
enough? I don't know, I could make grits. What are grits, anyway? <br>
WINTERS: It you could just sit. <br>
(The Master and Lucy walk away.) <br>
MASTER: Misery guts. What do you think? It's good, isn't it? <br>
LUCY: It's beautiful. <br>
MASTER: Some of my best work. Ministry of Defence. I helped design this
place. Every detail.

DOCTOR: No, wait. Shush, shush, shush, shush. Can't you hear it? <br>
JACK: Hear what? <br>
MARTHA: Doctor, my family's on board. <br>
DOCTOR: Brilliant. This way. <br>
(They run down a gangway to level 4, then open a door at the end.) <br>

MARTHA: Doctor, what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: He's cannibalised the Tardis. <br>

the time console.) <br>

trigger at two minutes past eight. <br>
JACK: First contact is at eight, then two minutes later <br>
MARTHA: What's it for? What does a paradox machine do? <br>
JACK: More important, can you stop it? <br>
DOCTOR: Not till I know what it's doing. Touch the wrong bit, blow up
the solar system. <br>
MARTHA: Then we've got to get to the Master. <br>
JACK: Yeah. How are we going to stop him? <br>

Winters to take the address. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WINTERS: My fellow Americans, patriots, people of
the world. I stand before you today as ambassador for humanity, a role
I will undertake with the utmost solemnity. Perhaps our Toclafane
cousins can offer us much, but what is important is not that we gain
material benefits, but that we learn to see ourselves anew. <br>
(The Doctor, Martha and Jack enter quietly.) <br>
WINTERS: For as long as man has looked at the stars, he has wondered
what mysteries they hold. Now we know we are not alone. <br>
JACK: (sotto) This plan, you going to tell us? <br>
WINTERS: No longer unique in the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: If I can get this around the Master's neck, cancel out his
perception, they'll see him for real. It's just hard to go unnoticed
with everyone on red alert. If they stop me you've got a key. <br>
JACK: Yes, sir. <br>
MARTHA: I'll get him. <br>
WINTERS: And I ask you now, I ask of the human race, to join with me in
welcoming our friends. I give you the Toclafane. <br>
(The four spheres appear.) <br>
WINTERS: My name is Arthur Coleman Winters, President Elect of the
United States of America, and designated representative of the United
Nations. I welcome you to the planet Earth and its associated moon. <br>
MALE SPHERE: You're not the Master. <br>
FEMALE SPHERE: We like the Mister Master. <br>
MALE SPHERE 2: We don't like you. <br>
WINTERS: I can be master, if you so wish. I will accept mastery over
you, if that is God's will. <br>
MALE SPHERE 2: Man is stupid. <br>
MALE SPHERE: Master is our friend. <br>
FEMALE SPHERE Where's my Master, pretty please? <br>
MASTER: Oh, all right then. It's me. Ta da! Sorry, sorry, I have this
effect. People just get obsessed. Is it the smile? Is it the
aftershave? Is it the capacity to laugh at myself? I don't know. It's
crazy. <br>
WINTERS: Saxon, what are you talking about? <br>
MASTER: I'm taking control, Uncle Sam, starting with you. Kill him. <br>
(A sphere points its weapon at Winters and blasts him into little
pieces. General consternation and guns drawn. The Master laughs and
applauds.) <br>
MASTER: Guards. <br>
GUARD: Nobody move! Nobody move! <br>
MASTER: Now then, peoples of the Earth. Please attend carefully. <br>
(The Doctor takes off his key and tries to run forward. Two men in
black grab him.) <br>
GUARD: Stop him! <br>
MASTER: We meet at last, Doctor. Oh, ho. I love saying that. <br>
DOCTOR: Stop it! Stop it now! <br>
MASTER: As if a perception filter's going to work on me. And look, it's
the girlie and the freak. Although, I'm not sure which one's which. <br>
(Jack runs forward. The Master zaps him with his screwdriver.) <br>
MASTER: Laser screwdriver. Who'd have sonic? And the good thing is,
he's not dead for long. I get to kill him again! <br>
DOCTOR: Master, just calm down. Just look at what you're doing. Just
stop. If you could see yourself <br>
MASTER: Oh, do excuse me. Little bit of personal business. Back in a
minute. Let him go. <br>
DOCTOR: It's that sound. The sound in your head. What if I could help? <br>
MASTER: Oh, how to shut him up? I know. Memory Lane. Professor Lazarus.
Remember him and his genetic manipulation device? What, did you think
that little Tish got that job merely by coincidence? I've been laying
traps for you all this time. And if I can concentrate all that Lazarus
technology into one little screwdriver? But, ooo, if I only had the
Doctor's biological code. Oh, wait a minute, I do. <br>
(He opens a large metal briefcase.) <br>
MASTER: I've got his hand. And if Lazarus made himself younger, what if
I reverse it? Another hundred years? <br>
(The Master aims his screwdriver at the Doctor, who goes into rapid
convulsions. Jack revives with Martha next to him.) <br>
JACK: Teleport. <br>
MARTHA: I can't. <br>
JACK: We can't stop him. Get out of here. Get out. <br>
(Lucy is looking very unhappy with all this. The Master stops zapping
the Doctor, who now looks at least a hundred years old.) <br>
MARTHA: Doctor? I've got you. <br>
MASTER: Ah, she's a would be doctor. But tonight, Martha Jones, we've
flown them in all the way from prison. <br>

together with cable ties.) <br>
GUARD: Come on, move. <br>
MARTHA: Mum. <br>
FRANCINE: I'm sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: The Toclafane. What are they? Who are they? <br>
MASTER: Doctor, if I told you the truth, your hearts would break. <br>
MALE SPHERE: Is it time? Is it ready? <br>
FEMALE SPHERE: Is the machine singing? <br>
MASTER: Two minutes past. So, Earthings. Basically, er, end of the
world. Here come the drums! <br>
(Rogue Trader's song 'Voodoo Child' starts playing as the paradox
machine in the Tardis activates.) <br>
SINGER: Here come the drums. Here come the drums. Baby, baby, baby. You
are my voodoo child, my voodoo child. Don't say maybe, maybe. <br>
(A tear appears in the sky above the Valiant and thousands of spheres
pour out.) <br>
SINGER: It's supernatural. I'm coming undone. Baby, baby, baby. You are
my voodoo child, my voodoo child. Don't say maybe, maybe. It's
supernatural. I'm coming undone. Baby, baby, baby. You are my voodoo
child, my voodoo child. <br>
MASTER: How many do you think? <br>
LUCY: I, I don't know. <br>
MASTER: Six billion. Down you go, kids! <br>
(The spheres head to the population centres and open fire.) <br>
MASTER: Shall we decimate them? That sounds good. A nice word,
decimate. Remove one tenth of the population! <br>
(The Doctor whispers to Martha, although we don't actually see that in
this episode. She moves away from him, holding Jack's bracelet.) <br>
GENEVA [OC]: Valiant, this is Geneva. We're getting slaughtered down
here. Valiant, report. Help us. For God's sake, help us! They're
everywhere! <br>
(Other reports come in in other languages.) <br>
LONDON [OC]: This is London, Valiant. This is London calling. What do
we do? They're killing us! The Toclafane are all around. They're
killing us.

Doctor nods.) </font></p>
