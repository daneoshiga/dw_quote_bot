</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(High on a mountainside, sheltered by a rocky
outcrop, a camp fire glimmers fitfully in the night air. A man cries
out. Edward Travers, woken by the cry, sits up quickly.) <br>
TRAVERS: John? <br>
(Noticing his companion's empty sleeping bag, Travers takes his rifle
and moves towards the sound.) <br>
TRAVERS: John, where are you? <br>
(Another scream. Travers back away in fear then turns and stumbles into
the night. An enormous shadow falls across the campsite and an object
is tossed to the ground - Travers' rifle, twisted beyond recognition.)

front of the scanner screen.) <br>
DOCTOR: I don't believe it. Marvellous. After all this time. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, what's so marvellous about that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see, Jamie? It's the Himalayas. And I do
believe we're in exactly the right.
Now, wait a minute. <br>
JAMIE: The Hima - what? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Shush. <br>
VICTORIA: The Himalayas, Jamie. They're mountains. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, I can see that. Hey, is it the Earth, Doctor? I don't fancy
another tangle down the Cybermen's tomb. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, shush. Yes, of course it's the Earth. Yes, yes, I
think I'm right. Yes. <br>
JAMIE: Where are these mountains? <br>
VICTORIA: Don't you know where the Himalayas are? They're in India.
Well, at least I think so. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it! I knew it, I knew it. It's incredible. Right.
Oh no. No, not India. This is Tibet. That's where we are, Tibet. Now,
there's no time to be lost. Come along, Jamie, we must find the ghanta.
<br>
JAMIE: The what? <br>
DOCTOR: The ghanta, the ghanta. I put it here somewhere. Come along,
Jamie, help me. <br>
(The Doctor rummages in a large chest.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, what am I supposed to be looking for? <br>
DOCTOR: I told you it's. Good Lord, I haven't seen that for years. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, that's the ghanta then? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. It's a. Well, whatever it is, it's nice to see
it again. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh. <br>
(Jamie has found a set of bagpipes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Come along, Victoria. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, would you look at these? You never told me you had
these. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Hey. Oh, I could fix those easily. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I was afraid of that. <br>
VICTORIA: Jamie, you're getting as bad as the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, help me find the ghanta. <br>
VICTORIA: It would help us considerably if we knew what we were looking
for. <br>
DOCTOR: Ghanta! <br>
VICTORIA: But what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, what is it? You don't know? Oh, it's a bell. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, it's a bell, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, a bell. Oh, well now we know what we're looking for. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a Tibetan bell, actually. A holy relic. This one is
quite small. It has a dragon on it. As a matter of fact, it has rather
an interesting history. It was. Oh. Ah ha, yes, I'll have that. <br>
The Doctor takes out a huge fur coat.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's just the thing for this climate. Now, you might as
well find yourselves something while you're about it. How do I look? <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor, you look beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought I might. I think I'll go and have a scout
around. Now, you two find the bell. It's very important. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, but why do you want it? <br>
DOCTOR: Because down there it's going to guarantee us the welcome of a
lifetime. <br>
VICTORIA: Down there? <br>
(The Doctor goes outside.) <br>
JAMIE: Oh, don't ask me. When you've been with the Doctor as long as I
have, you begin to realise you don't know what he's talking about. We'd
better find this bell of his. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, wait a minute, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, come and give us a hand. <br>
VICTORIA: I want to see where the Doctor's gone. Now if I turn this to
the left it should. Ah ha that's it. <br>
(Jamie takes a scimitar from the chest.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, now would you look at this. Oh, that's marvellous. What.
Hey, what's that? <br>
VICTORIA: Where? <br>
JAMIE: A great sort of hairy beastie. Turn the thing back. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh. <br>
JAMIE: No, to the right. <br>
VICTORIA: I am. <br>
JAMIE: Downwards. That's it, there. <br>
(A large fur covered figure looms up on the screen.) <br>
JAMIE: Oh no, my mistake. The great hairy beastie, it's the Doctor. </font></p>

spectacular view of some buildings nestling in the valley below.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jamie has found a drawstring bag labelled Ghanta
of Detsen Monastery.) <br>
VICTORIA: A monastery. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be where he's gone. <br>
VICTORIA: I wonder why he wouldn't take us? <br>
JAMIE: You can never tell with the Doctor. Hey, just thought. Do they
let lasses into monasteries? <br>
VICTORIA: I don't know. Oh, don't say that. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, never mind. I suppose he'll manage somehow. <br>
VICTORIA: Hey, shall we open it? <br>
JAMIE: I don't think so. The Doctor might not like it.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Making his way back to the Tardis, the Doctor
notices something on the ground. He bends down to examine a vast
footprint. From some way off, a shaggy figure is watching from behind a
tree. It disappears as the Doctor stands up again.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VICTORIA: Apart from climbing boots, I really think
you ought to wear something warm. <br>
JAMIE: I tell you, I'm a Highlander. The cold doesn't affect me. <br>
VICTORIA: There's a great deal of difference between the Highlands and
the Himalayas, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, they're bigger. <br>
(The Doctor enters.) <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, there you are, Doctor. I found this bell thing you were
looking for. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid. <br>
VICTORIA: Is the monastery far? Can we come too? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. No. One thing at a time, Victoria. We must find this
ghanta. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, here. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Ah. Hmm. <br>
VICTORIA: Is this where we're going, Detsen? <br>
DOCTOR: Detsen, yes, that's the name of the monastery, but I'm afraid
you're not going. Well, not yet a while anyway. <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I think it'd be better if I went alone. <br>
JAMIE: You've seen something haven't you? Would it not be better I went
with you? <br>
VICTORIA: Is there something dangerous then, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good heavens, no. No, there's nothing for you to worry
about. Now, you stay here with Jamie, inside, and I'll be as quick as I
can. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, er, Doctor? <br>
(Victoria holds out the bag.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. I nearly forgot it. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A trail of large footprints leads across the rocky
terrain and into the trees where the same large hairy figure stands
staring down onto the path. The Doctor approaches. He stops and looks
around him, then carries on.)

JAMIE: No, I don't think we should. <br>

DOCTOR: Anybody here? <br>
(He finds the mangled rifle, then behind a rock, a dead man.) <br>
(Outside the Tardis, Victoria is sight-seeing whilst wearing plus-fours
and a tweed jacket.) <br>
JAMIE: What can you see? <br>
VICTORIA: Come on, it's a marvellous view. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, so it is. Now, come away back. <br>
VICTORIA: Why? <br>
JAMIE: Because the Doctor said that, Well if you must know, I am cold. <br>
VICTORIA: Didn't I tell you? Now why don't you go and get that coat? <br>
JAMIE: Because I'm not leaving you out here on your own, and that's
final. <br>
VICTORIA: Jamie, look. <br>
JAMIE: What is it? <br>
VICTORIA: Footprints. Look at the size of them. Something's been
walking round the Tardis. What could it be, Jamie, a bear? <br>
JAMIE: Whatever it is, it's pretty big. We'd better get inside. <br>
VICTORIA: I'd like to find out what it is first. Wouldn't you? <br>
JAMIE: Look, we must be careful. This could be dangerous. Wait while I
get that sword. </font></p>

monastery wall. He is carrying Travers' rucksack. He knocks. He knocks
again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello there? <br>
(No sound but the wind. The Doctor knocks again then pushes at the
small wicket gate, which creaks open.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Courtyard]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It is deserted. Cloisters run down one side and
doors leading to the interior. At the far end is a statue of Buddha, on
a plinth. The Doctor walks over to it. Then he tries one of the doors,
but it is locked.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello? Where is everybody? <br>
(He turns around to see a small band of warrior monks with swords
drawn. The gate is closing behind them. A bearded European with
bandaged head is with them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. I thought, I thought for one moment. <br>
KHRISONG: (warrior leader) What do you want here? <br>
DOCTOR: I've come to <br>
TRAVERS: Look! He's got my rucksack. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that. Oh. <br>
TRAVERS: You murderous devil. <br>
KHRISONG: Who is this man? <br>
TRAVERS: I don't know, but this is mine all right. <br>
THOMNI: (young monk) But you said it was <br>
KHRISONG: Be silent. You said it was a beast that attacked you. <br>
TRAVERS: Yes, but it was dark, remember. All I could see was a vague
shape, but I felt its hair. Well it's quite obvious now it's this coat
he's wearing. <br>
KHRISONG: Why did you attack this man? <br>
DOCTOR: Me? I haven't attacked anyone. I found the haversack on the
mountain. <br>
TRAVERS: He's lying. <br>
DOCTOR: I also found a dead man. <br>
TRAVERS: Yes, and you killed him. <br>
KHRISONG: Enough. Seize him. <br>
DOCTOR: But you can't possibly <br>
KHRISONG: Silence. This man accuses you of one crime, but there have
been many others. If you are responsible, be sure you will be punished.
Take him away. <br>
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous. Why don't you listen to me? Where are
you taking me? <br>
TRAVERS: Watch him carefully, Khrisong. He's dangerous. <br>
KHRISONG: This is possible. <br>
THOMNI: We do not know he is the attacker. <br>
TRAVERS: Of course he is. I've just said he's so. <br>
THOMNI: Why then did he come here? <br>
KHRISONG: That also we shall discover.

leading in and out.) <br>
VICTORIA: Jamie, look. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be where the beastie lives, right enough. And it's
as far as we're going. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, we can't turn back now. <br>
JAMIE: We can and we will. It could be dangerous. <br>
VICTORIA: How do you know? It may be quite harmless. <br>
JAMIE: With feet that size? <br>
VICTORIA: Well just a quick look inside. <br>
JAMIE: Look, if that animal is dangerous we could be walking into a
trap. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, but Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: No, we're going back. I mean it. <br>
VICTORIA: Jamie. Look. <br>
JAMIE: Hey. Wait a minute. <br>
VICTORIA: Well, what is it? <br>
JAMIE: Look there, just inside the cave. <br>
VICTORIA: Where? I can't see anything. </font></p>

JAMIE: It might not be an animal's den after all. I'm going to take a
closer look. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh but Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Look, a wild animal's one thing. I'm not afraid of a man. This
is a man's work all right. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh let's go back, Jamie. Jamie. Jamie! <br>
JAMIE: Hey, come and a look at this. <br>
VICTORIA: Jamie, listen. There's something coming. <br>
JAMIE: Get back. <br>
(They take cover by the entrance. Outside, two scaly claws move a huge
boulder across the opening, shutting them in.)

window. He gets up and tries jumping up to see out of it, but it is too
high. Then he tries standing on a stool. Now he can see out. The
shutter in his cell door opens.) <br>
TRAVERS: It's a hundred foot drop outside that window. There's no way
out, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't think there would be. <br>
TRAVERS: How did you track me down? <br>
DOCTOR: Track you down? I don't even know who you are. <br>
TRAVERS: Don't play the innocent with me. It won't work. If it wasn't
for my expedition you wouldn't be here. You're one of those wretched
newspaper men. <br>
DOCTOR: Paper men? I wish I know what you are talking about? <br>
TRAVERS: Oh, yes. You laughed at me in the press didn't you. Travers,
the mad anthropologist. After that, even my own Society wouldn't
finance me. But I know they're here. Twenty years I've been searching. <br>
DOCTOR: Twenty years. <br>
TRAVERS: I've staked my reputation and every penny I own on this
expedition. Now, when I'm close to finding them, you want to steal my
glory just for the sake of a cheap headline. <br>
DOCTOR: Finding them? Finding what? <br>
TRAVERS: Don't pretend. They're here, somewhere on these mountains. <br>
DOCTOR: What are?. <br>
TRAVERS: You know. The Yeti. The Abominable Snowmen.

out of here. I'm going to see what's down there. <br>

JAMIE: Aye, there might. That's why I want you to stay here. <br>

attacked you. <br>
TRAVERS: Rubbish. The Yeti are timid creatures. They're shy. <br>
DOCTOR: But <br>
TRAVERS: They're afraid of men. <br>
DOCTOR: Why me? Why say I did it? <br>
TRAVERS: You want a clear field, don't you. I discovered the Yeti. The
honour's mine, but you want to take it from me. Why, you even murdered
my companion just to get a cheap story for your newspaper. <br>
DOCTOR: That is ridiculous. <br>
TRAVERS: Is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Whoever killed your friend had enormous strength. <br>
TRAVERS: Yes? <br>

done. The expedition must go on. Khrisong will find out the truth. <br>

Travers. <br>
THOMNI: But how do we know he is telling the truth? <br>
KHRISONG: Why should he lie? In any case, I am not so concerned with
the death of Travers's companion. Four of our brothers have been
slaughtered. That is my concern. <br>
RINCHEN: (a lama) Had we not agreed that the Yeti were responsible? <br>
KHRISONG: True, Rinchen. But have we not also wondered why? They were
so rarely seen. Timid. Then, suddenly, they become savage. Did we not
wonder why? Did we not wonder what or whom had brought this change. And
now, here is this stranger and Travers accuses him. He may be the
cause. I ask you again, let me put it to the truth. Now. <br>
RINCHEN: You are asking us to condemn a man to certain death. <br>
KHRISONG: I am Chief Warrior. Is it not my duty to protect you? <br>
RINCHEN: But not by taking a man's life. <br>
KHRISONG: Yes, if it is necessary. <br>
SAPAN: (a lama) No. Only the Abbot can decide. Songsten alone can
approve such measures. <br>
(A gong sounds.) <br>
RINCHEN: It is time for prayer, my brothers. <br>
(The lamas go to the cloisters. Chanting starts.) <br>
KHRISONG: Wait! We must decide now. <br>
SAPAN: No, Khrisong. After our meditations we will consult the Abbot. <br>
KHRISONG: This is foolishness. Time will be wasted. Do they wish more
of our brothers to die before I'm allowed to take action. <br>
THOMNI: There is no other way. <br>
KHRISONG: There is, for me. Let them meditate. Let them consult. I,
Khrisong, will act. Bring me the prisoner.

reasonable sort of chap. What's going on here? <br>

is what we thought until <br>
DOCTOR: Until I turned up. I see. Every time I visit Detsen the
monastery seems to be in some sort of trouble or another. <br>

their strength with my strength. <br>

I feel your grasp upon this frail body. Why? What is happening? This
was not your plan. But if you continue to expand? I have brought the
world to its end. <br>

DOCTOR: Padmasambhava. So it's true. <br>
PADMASAMBHAVA: I have been kept alive so many years, but now our time
left is very, very short. Listen carefully. Perhaps you can <br>
DOCTOR: Kept alive? I don't understand. <br>
PADMASAMBHAVA: I didn't know. I didn't realise. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Try to tell me. <br>
PADMASAMBHAVA: Intelligence. Formless in space. I astral travelled. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. You made mental contact with this intelligence? <br>
PADMASAMBHAVA: It used my mind. It controls my body. <br>
DOCTOR: But why? <br>
PADMASAMBHAVA: Experiment. Wished material form. A voice, it said. I
believed. Experiment. But now. Help. You must help me. <br>

things. Why are the monks being driven away? What is the purpose of
these robots, the Yeti? Where is their control? Padmasambhava?

as to what's been happening. <br>

worrying about. <br>

is I really need more information. However, I'll just have to take a

THOMNI: But we have destroyed the machines. <br>
JAMIE: Well there must something else that controls them. The control
unit. Of course, the sphere. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Inner sanctum]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Yeti enter. Jamie smashes the sphere. There is
a flash of light. The robot's chest units explode and they collapse.) <br>
VOICE [OC]: One stroke of fortune will not save you. <br>
(Travers and Ralpachan enter. Travers shoots at the old man, who
catches the bullets in his hand.) <br>
VOICE [OC]: Stupid man. Did you not feel enough of my power when you
met me in the cave? <br>
TRAVERS: The cave? <br>
DOCTOR: The cave. Jamie! There was a pyramid in the cave! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Control room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAMIE: There's one here too. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Inner sanctum]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Destroy it! <br>
VOICE [OC]: No! <br>
(Jamie uses Thomni's stave to smash the pyramid and Padmasambhava
screams. He falls from the throne, knocking over the model. Everything
shakes as something in the distance explodes. It is the pyramid in the
cave, which takes the top of the mountain with it in the blast.) <br>
VICTORIA: Look at him. <br>
PADMASAMBHAVA: At last, peace. Thank you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye old friend. <br>
JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. It worked. The Intelligence is destroyed. <br>
TRAVERS: Yes, well, it was most decidedly tricky for a minute or two. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Thomni, you can signal the monks they can return. <br>
(Thonmi and Ralpachan leave.) <br>
TRAVERS: Doctor, are you trying to tell me that that old man was
responsible for all this? The Yeti? The cave? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. He was just a tool in the hands of a monstrous
brain. It wasn't his fault. <br>
VICTORIA: It's horrible. Let's get away from here. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, come on. <br>
(The monastery gong rings out.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Courtyard]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dawn. The gong is still sounding as the travellers
prepare to depart.) <br>
THOMNI: Please, Doctor. Our Abbot will be most grieved that he did not
thank you personally. Will you not wait? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah no, Thomni, we're anxious to get back to the Tar. <br>
(Jamie coughs.) <br>
DOCTOR: We're anxious to get back. <br>
THOMNI: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
TRAVERS: I'll see them safely up the mountain. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Thomni. <br>
JAMIE: Goodbye. <br>
VICTORIA: Bye, Thomni. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Mountainside]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They find the remains of a Yeti.) <br>
JAMIE: Aye, well those things won't bother us anymore, Doctor. <br>
VICTORIA: Those horrible things. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, they were clever machines. Almost a pity to have had them
destroyed. Well, at least you'll have something to take home from your
expedition, Mister Travers. <br>
TRAVERS: I suppose so. But nobody'll believe me. They'd think I'd had
it made. No, I'm afraid the expedition's over now. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, look. <br>
JAMIE: Oh no. <br>
DOCTOR: It can't be. <br>
(A shaggy, bear-like creature is racing towards them. Then it sees them
and runs away again.) <br>
TRAVERS: A Yeti. A real Yeti! At last! Excuse the haste. Goodbye and
all that. Mustn't lose this one. <br>
JAMIE: Do you think he'll ever find his abominable snowman, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that we shall never know, Jamie. What's the matter with
you? Are you cold or something? <br>
JAMIE: Oh it's all right for you in your home made Yeti kit. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose there is a little bit of a nip in the air. <br>
JAMIE: A nip? A nip? Just look at my knees. They're bright blue. <br>
DOCTOR: What a horrible sight. <br>
JAMIE: Could you not land us somewhere warmer next time? <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, you never know, do you? <br>
(The Doctor plays his recorder as they walk up to the Tardis.) </font>
