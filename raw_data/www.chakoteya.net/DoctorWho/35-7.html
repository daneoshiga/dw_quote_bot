inhaler as a Zygon snarls at her before transforming into her double.) <br>

<br>
DOCTOR 10: Any second now, you're going to stop that countdown. Both of
you. Together.<br>
DOCTOR 11: And then you're going to negotiate the most perfect treaty
of all time. <br>
DOCTOR 10: Safeguards all round, completely fair on both sides. <br>
DOCTOR 11: And the key to perfect negotiation? <br>
DOCTOR 10: Not knowing what side you're on.<br>
(The Doctors push back their chairs, stand up, and get out their sonic screwdrivers.)<br>
DOCTOR 11: So, for the next few hours, until we decide to let you out <br>
DOCTOR 10: No one in this room will be able to remember if they're
human <br>
DOCTOR 11: Or Zygon. <br>

BOTH KATES: Cancel the detonation!<br>

(We are watching a recording in progress. The Osgoods are sitting behind
 a desk with a eighteen inch square box on
it, making a video. The one on the right has a 4th Doctor scarf looped
around her neck. We'll call her Osgood 1. The one on the left is
wearing the 7th Doctors query motif pullover. Designate her Osgood 2. 
One of the papers pinned to a notice board on the wall is a headline - 
White House Appoints Alien Ambassador.) <br>OSGOOD 2: Hello.<br>OSGOOD 1: Hello. Do you want to?<br>OSGOOD 2: No, you can, if you <br>
BOTH: Shall we do it together? Operation Double. The Zygon peace treaty. <br>
OSGOOD 2: I'm Osgood. <br>OSGOOD 1: I'm also Osgood.<br>OSGOOD 2: Remember that. It'll be important later.<br>OSGOOD 1: Operation Double is a covert operation, outside of normal UNIT
strictures, to resettle and rehouse
an alien race in secrecy on planet Earth.<br>
OSGOOD 2:&nbsp; With UNIT's help, twenty million
Zygons have been allowed
to take human form, been dispersed around the world, and are now living
amongst us.
<br>
OSGOOD 1: We're making this in case something goes wrong. In case UNIT is
infiltrated.
In case something occurs to unmask the Zygons. <br>
OSGOOD 2: Or in case one or both
of us dies.
<br>
(We are shown a cemetery, with an Osgood standing in front a black 
marble headstone simply engraved My Sister, holding white flowers.)<br>
OSGOOD 1: The Zygons are a peaceful race. <br>
OSGOOD 2: Their shape-changing ability should not
be considered a weapon.
<br>
OSGOOD 1: It's a survival mechanism. <br>
OSGOOD 2: They embed themselves in other cultures, and
live out their lives in their
new bodies in peace and harmony. Mainly. <br>
OSGOOD 1: Any race is capable of the best
and the worst.
<br>
OSGOOD 2: Every race is peaceful and warlike. <br>
OSGOOD 1: Good and evil. <br>
OSGOOD 2: My race is no
exception.<br>OSGOOD 1: And neither is mine.<br>OSGOOD 2: If one Zygon goes rogue <br>
OSGOOD 1: Or one human <br>
OSGOOD 2: Then the ceasefire will break.<br>
(They put their hands on the box.)<br>OSGOOD 2: That's why the Doctor left us this. <br>
OSGOOD 1: He called it the Osgood Box.<br>OSGOOD 2: If you've been paying attention, you'll be able to guess why. <br>
OSGOOD 1: This is
the last resort. <br>
OSGOOD 2: The final sanction.<br>
OSGOOD 1: Pray this box is never needed. <br>
OSGOOD 2: Because if it is, that means the
ceasefire is breaking <br>OSGOOD 1: And with twenty million shape-changing Zygons dispersed around the world
<br>
OSGOOD 2: That is the Nightmare Scenario.<br>
<br>
(In Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, an adobe building is the Police 
Station. A woman runs for it as others unseen fire guns and shout a lot.
 It is Osgood, this time in a 6th Doctor question mark on the shirt 
collar costume, and brown Brigadier-style jumper. A bullet whizzes 
through the now open door and breaks a glass. She tries another door, 
but it is locked, so she hides under a desk and uses her inhaler before 
getting out her mobile phone. Before she can dial, something with red 
rubbery skin walks in. Her finger hovers email icon on her The Doctor T A
 R D I S Direct Link contact page, then she presses send. The Zygon 
grabs her and pulls her out from under the desk, then incapacitates her 
with a jolt of electricity to the forehead. Osgood drops her phone. The 
time is 10:21.)<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]</b>
<br>
<br>
(While Osgood's message is coming up on the scanner, the Doctor is 
playing Amazing Grace on his electric guitar. He sees the words 
Nightmare Scenario flashing.)<br>
<br>
<b>[Brockwell Park, London]</b>
<br>
<br>(A crocodile of school children are being escorted by two women 
teachers. The Tardis is standing nearby and the Doctor is sitting on a 
swing in the designated play area, using his mobile phone.)<br>
TEACHER: Come on, kids, no pushing!<br>CLARA [OC]: Hi, this is Clara Oswald. I'm probably on the Tube or in outer space.
Leave a message! (beep)<br>DOCTOR: Hello, it's Doctor Disco. I'm in the twenty first century. I don't know what
month.
I'm staking out some of the most dangerous creatures imaginable.
<br>
(Two little girls stop and stare at him.)<br>
DOCTOR: Operating under deep cover.
Trying not to attract suspicion. Give me a call, Clara. Nightmare
Scenario. I'm worried. <br>
(He follows the little girls to the monkey bars.)<br>DOCTOR: Okay. Hey, Monster High and Cinderella. Down off the monkey bars.
Listen to me. We've got to talk.
<br>
<br>
<b>[UNIT Safe House, South London]</b><br><br>
(A grand old building with a For Sale or To Let sign outside. Downstairs, Kate Lethbridge Stewart is giving orders.)<br>
KATE: Get me Colonel Walsh. And I need you to coordinate the Operation
Double locations.<br>
JAC: There are twenty million Zygons. And most of the data was with <br>
(Kate is holding a photograph of the two Osgoods.)<br>
JAC: Her.<br>
KATE: Do what you can. Start with any that have intelligence flags from
the past six months.<br>(Beeps.)<br>JAC: Walsh coming through.<br>WALSH [OC]: Walsh. Turmezistan. <br>KATE: Any new arrivals?<br>
(Walsh is a lady Red Beret.)<br>WALSH [on screen]: One. The pictures aren't very good. <br>
(Kate puts on her glasses to see.)<br>KATE: Can you zoom in on the prisoner? <br>
(Osgood is in manacles, being escorted by two Zygons.)<br>KATE: It's her. (to Jac) Get into her files. We have to assume they've been compromised. <br>
(Jac's tablet screen fills with Truth Or Consequences over and over again.)<br>
JAC: Er, too late. The encryption system's already been hacked. And they've
sent through another video.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Brockwell Park]</b><br>
<br>
(The Doctor is on the monkey bars with the serious two little girls..)<br>
DOCTOR: Look, I admire you, okay? I think you're ingenious. Pretending
to be a couple of seven year&nbsp; olds is a splendid way
to conceal your blobbiness. But let's not pretend. You're very blobby.
In fact, you two are the big blobs.
And you are not patrolling the ceasefire. <br>
(The girls climb down, the Doctor goes down the slide.)<br>
DOCTOR: Fine. Fine, bury your heads.
Listen to me. Listen!
There are other factions. I know that there are other blobby factions
that you don't control. They're planning something.
And if we don't get together and stop it, it'll be the end of this. Of
all of you.<br>JEMIMA: This is our jurisdiction, Doctor. These are our creatures. We are close
to finding them.
<br>
CLAUDETTE: They are our children, and we will deal with them.<br>
DOCTOR: Your kids are out of control. I'm taking this out of your hands.<br>(His phone rings.)<br>
DOCTOR: Don't even think about going anywhere. <br>
(He walks away to answer it.)<br>
DOCTOR: Are you phoning me with your backside again, or are you really
sending me a distress signal?<br>
KATE [OC]: I'm really sending you a distress signal. <br>
<br>
<b>[UNIT Safe House]</b><br>
<br>
KATE: They've kidnapped
Osgood and they've stolen the location of every Zygon on Earth.
Doctor, the ceasefire's broken down.<br><br>
<b>[Brockwell Park]</b><br>
<br>
(Red gas is hissing from an alien canister.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hey! Away! Away!
Get those kids out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of
the way! Move! Out of the way!<br>(The school children and their 
teachers flee. Zygons step through the gas to grab Jemima and Claudette,
 who screams, and carry them away to a nearby Parks Maintenance van, 
registration LR55 YOY. It leaves with a squeal of tyres so the Doctor 
runs back to the Tardis, past a black three finger symbol on the notice board.) <br>
<br>
<b>[UNIT Safe House]</b><br>
<br>
(That same symbol, this time in white on a black background along with 
alien lettering, is on the flag behind Osgood as she reads a prepared 
statement. She is flanked by Zygons.)<br>
OSGOOD [on screen]: UNIT troops will be destroyed wherever they are in the world.
The enemies of our race will be destroyed wherever they are in the
world.
The war is about to begin. There will be truth or there will be
consequences.<br>
(Message ends. The Doctor uses his phone.)<br>
CLARA [OC]: Hi, this is Clara Oswald. I'm probably on the Tube or in
outer space. Leave a message! (beep)<br>
DOCTOR: Call me now.<br><br>
<b>[Block of flats]</b><br>
<br>
(Clara removes her helmet and gloves, and goes inside. Her phone 
bingles. The Doctor 127 Missed Calls. She listens to one of the 
messages.)<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Hello, it's Doctor Disco. <br>
(Then she encounters a sad boy sitting on the stairs.)<br>SANDEEP: Hello. <br>
CLARA: Oh, hello. Sandeep, hello. You okay? <br>
SANDEEP: I can't find my mummy and daddy.<br>
CLARA: Well, why don't you wait here, and I can go see if I can find
them?<br><br>
<b>[Sandeep's flat]<br>

CLARA: Hello? Hello?<br>(Suddenly Sandeep's father is standing behind her. She gasps.)<br>CLARA: Oh! Sorry. Er, your little boy is out there. He couldn't find you.<br>
(The man walks out.)<br>SANDEEP'S DAD [OC]: Daddy's here! <br>
(Then the mother walks in.)<br>
SANDEEP'S MUM: We can take him.<br>(Sandeep is screaming as his father carries him in over his shoulder.)<br>
CLARA: Is, is he okay? <br>SANDEEP'S MUM: Everything's fine.<br><br>
<b>[Block of flats]</b><br>

(Clara leaves number 52, tying back her hair. The door slams behind her. She gets out her phone and calls the Doctor.)
<br>
CLARA: Did you just call yourself Doctor Disco?
<br>
<br>
<b>[Drakeman Junio</b><b>r School, Dulwich</b><b>]</b><br>
<br>
(A UNIT vehicle arrives, and the Doctor and Clara get out.)<br>
KATE: This is where the Zygon High Command had their secret base.<br>CLARA: A junior school?<br>
(They go inside. Photographs of Jemima and Claudette are on a wall collage.)<br>KATE: Terms of the settlement, Operation Double, were these. Twenty million
Zygons, the entire hatchery, were allowed to be born and to stay on
Earth.
They were permitted to permanently take up the form of the nearest
available human beings. <br>
JAC: In this case, a large percentage of the
population
of the UK.<br>
<br>
<b>[Boiler room]</b><br><br>
KATE: You left us with an impossible situation, Doctor.<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. It's called peace. What about the two little girl commanders? Weren't they helping you?<br>KATE: They've been almost impossible to deal with since Osgood left.
Secretive, uncommunicative.
We've known there's something going on. Some radicalisation, some
revolution in the younger brood.
They said they had it under control. <br>
<br>
<b>[Command centre]</b><br>
<br>
(They go through a hole in the brick wall to an area festooned with red cords or cables. A giant sized polyp stands proud.)<br>DOCTOR: The Zygon command centre. That's the control polyp for all Zygons on
Earth.<br>JAC: It's horrible.<br>DOCTOR: Could you? Would you mind? Thank you. <br>
(Clara takes his torch. He splashes liquid from the pool in the centre of the polyp onto its fronds, then caresses some horns.)<br>DOCTOR: If this has been compromised, the Zygons are wide open. They'll be
starting to panic. Starting to worry.<br>CLARA: Doctor, do you want to be alone with that thing?<br>
DOCTOR: It's a command computer. You operate it by titivating the
fronds.<br>
CLARA: Are you enjoying that?<br>DOCTOR: I snogged a Zygon once. Old habits.<br>(Screens come to life, booting up with Sapphire.)<br>
DOCTOR: Still got the old magic.<br>CLARA: So, Osgood's been kidnapped, right? I thought Osgood was dead.<br>KATE: There've always been two of her, ever since the ceasefire. We never
knew which one was real. <br>
DOCTOR: Both of them.<br>KATE: Okay, which one was Zygon.<br>
DOCTOR: Both of them. They would have maintained a live link. They
were both Zygon and human at the same time.
They not only administered the peace, they <em>were</em> the peace. <br>
JAC: When the other Osgood died, the survivor went pretty much mad with
grief. Then she just disappeared. Went undercover in the States. Now,
of course, the rebels have her.<br>DOCTOR: Ah ha! Okay. Zygons hatched and dispersed all over, but something's gone
wrong. Mexico border, North Asia,
West Africa, Australia. Panic. Paranoia. What would happen if they knew
who we were?<br>(Beep.)<br>JAC: We've received another video.<br>
(They gather round Jac's tablet.)<br>
KATE: That's the Zygon High Command. It's Jemima and Claudette.<br>ZYGON [OC]: We have been betrayed. We were sold. Our rights were
violated. We demand the right to be ourselves. Normalise. Normalise! <br>
(Jemima and Claudette transform into Zygons, then are zapped to dust by electricity from two other Zygon hands.)<br>ZYGON [on screen]: We are now the Zygon High Command. All traitors will die. Truth or
consequences. <br>
(Message ends.)<br>DOCTOR: So, we have a Zygon revolution on our hands. We need to open negotiations.<br>KATE: I'm not negotiating with them. As far as they're concerned, everyone's a traitor. <br>
CLARA: If you're not going
to negotiate, what are you going to do?<br>KATE: They're holed up in this settlement in Turmezistan. It's where they've
taken Osgood. I'm going to order Colonel Walsh to bomb it.<br>DOCTOR: Isn't there a solution that doesn't involve bombing everyone?<br>KATE: The treaty's been comprehensively violated, Doctor.<br>DOCTOR: This is a splinter group. The rest of the Zygons, the vast majority,
they want to live in peace.
You start bombing them, you'll radicalise the lot. That's exactly what
the splinter group wants.<br>JAC: Truth or consequences. What exactly does that mean?<br>KATE: It's just the usual kind of nonsense these idiots call
themselves.<br>CLARA: It's in New Mexico. <br>
KATE: What?<br>CLARA: It's a town in New Mexico. Truth or Consequences. Er, they renamed it
after a TV show, for a bet or something. It's a Trivial Pursuit
question. I used to memorise Trivial Pursuit questions so I could win.<br>KATE: That's the last place we received signal from Osgood's phone, isn't it?
New Mexico.<br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Kate Stewart, no bombs for you. Go to Truth Or
Consequences. See what you can find out.
The Doctor will go to Turmezistan. Negotiate peace, rescue Osgood, and
prevent this war, cos that's what he does.
Clara, Jac, you stay here. This is your country. Protect it from the
scary monsters. And also from the Zygons. <br>
CLARA: Fine.
  <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, and do you still have the presidential aircraft?<br>CLARA: I thought you didn't like being President of the World.<br>
DOCTOR: No, but I like poncing about in a big plane.<br>
  <br>
  <b>[Airport tarmac]</b><br><br>
(Night. The Doctor poses on the steps then goes inside his aeroplane. Kate and Clara walk away.)<br>
CLARA: How many troops do you have?<br>KATE: Not many. Usually on bigger cases we can draft in from the regular
army. We can't do that now. The secrecy of the project has to be
maintained.<br>CLARA: You got any snazzy weapons?<br>KATE: There was an attempted Zygon invasion before, in the seventies, eighties. One of
our staff was a naval surgeon. Worked at Porton Down on the captured
Zygons.
Developed Zee-67. It's a nerve gas. Unravels their DNA. Basically turns
them inside out.<br>CLARA: Where do you keep it?<br>KATE: We don't. It was taken. The formula, the lot. <br>CLARA: Who took it?<br>KATE: Somebody with a Tardis.<br>
JAC: They're ready for you, ma'am.<br>KATE: (to Clara) Keep in touch. <br>
(Kate is driven away.)<br>CLARA: Oh, I just need to swing by home and grab a couple of things.<br>JAC: Yeah, course.<br>

 52. She and Jac are walking down the stairs when they hear -)<br>
SANDEEP'S DAD: Quick, before someone sees us.<br>(Sandeep's parents are 
dragging a large bundle to the lift. Clara and Jac watch them put it 
inside, then hear Sandeep call out. The lift door closes and it goes 
down.)<br>CLARA: It's really slow. We can catch them. Come on!<br>(Jac and Clara stand outside the lift on the ground floor as it creaks and groans.)<br>CLARA: It's slower than usual.<br>JAC: What's wrong with it? <br>
(The lift doors open. It is empty.)<br>JAC: Is there a cellar, or somewhere else they could have gone? <br>
CLARA: No.<br>
  <br>
  <b>[Lift]</b><br><br>
(They step inside and the doors close. Slime dribbles down the control panel.)<br>JAC: Ugh, what is that?<br>(The front of the control panel pops loose. Clara opens it to reveal Zygon style controls.)<br>JAC: No, don't.<br>(Clara
 touches the controls. The lights go out and the lift drops, shaking 
violently. Clara turns on the light on her phone. Then the lift stops 
and the doors open.<br>
<br><b>[Tunnel]</b><br><br>
(They step out into a huge tunnel. Sandeep is calling out in the 
distance. Shadowy figures with torches are carrying things in the 
distance. Clara and Jac press themselves against the wall of the 
tunnel.)<br>
CLARA: I think we need to get some reinforcements.

going to allow them to disperse.
You can't track a shape-shifter.<br>LISA: Visual on the target.<br>WALSH: Confirm strike.<br>DOCTOR: Colonel.<br>WALSH: Confirm strike. <br>

stops, gets out and walks over to a sign on a wall - No Dogs - to which 
the words No British have been added. She is watched as she checks her 
map then takes out her gun before walking to the same Police Station that Osgood ran into. The place is a mess.)<br>

of them outside at any one time.
But they always take different shapes, we don't know how many there
really are.
We don't know how they come and go. Whether they go through tunnels,
or whether they turn into dogs and run out across the hills.<br>DOCTOR: So, that's what we'll find out.<br>WALSH: We should have that gas. We should be able to rip them inside out.<br>DOCTOR: Colonel, take it easy. They're trying to unsettle you. They're trying

Don't use my name.<br>HITCHLEY'S MUM: They took us here. They came to the house and took us. They took your

(She starts to walk down the steps.)<br>HITCHLEY: Stay where you are.<br>HITCHLEY'S MUM: It's not us who are the impostors. Don't let them trick you. It's your

WALSH [OC]: Only your mum could
know.<br>HITCHLEY: Mom, I'm going to have to ask you some questions. <br>HITCHLEY'S MUM: Don't do this. You know it's me. Don't let them trick you.<br>HITCHLEY: Date and place of my birth.<br>HITCHLEY'S MUM: They brought us here. They're using us against you. I'm scared. Please,
I'm so scared.<br>
HITCHLEY: Name of my favourite teddy bear.<br>HITCHLEY'S MUM: I don't remember. I'm sorry, I don't. <br>

(More people come out of the church. The soldiers start to lower their weapons as they recognise them.)<br>
HITCHLEY: Stay back! All of you, stay back from them! <br>

(The soldiers all raise their weapons again. Hitchley's mum closes her eyes, then Hitchley lowers his gun. He is nearly crying.)<br>
HITCHLEY: What proof? <br>

(The soldiers follow their relatives into the church.)<br>
  <br>
  <b>[Behind the church]</b><br><br>
WALSH: Damn it. <em>Damn it</em>!<br>
DOCTOR: This is pointless! Just let me go in and talk!<br>
(They run round the church. Walsh shoots the lock off a side door.)<br><br>
  <b>[Church]</b><br>
  <br>
(Walsh and the Doctor enter a room with a strategy table laid out. There
 are sets of hairy bundles on the floor, still sizzling with 
electricity.)<br>
WALSH: They've executed my men.
<br>DOCTOR: Where are the Zygons?<br>WALSH: We need to bomb the hell out of this place. It's <em>infested</em>
with these things. We can't tell who the enemy is any more, we can't
count them and we can't track them!<br>DOCTOR: I'm not going to let you do that.<br>WALSH: I just lost my men, I'll quite happily bomb the hell out of anywhere. We need to move. Strike's on its way.<br>DOCTOR: I need to find Osgood.<br>WALSH: You've got ten minutes.<br>
(Walsh leaves. The Doctor is looking at the coloured blocks on the table when -)<br>
OSGOOD [OC]: Help! Help!<br>
DOCTOR: Osgood! Osgood! <br>
(He stamps on the floor, looking for a trap door.)<br>
OSGOOD [OC]: Doctor!<br>
DOCTOR: Osgood!<br>
OSGOOD [OC]: Doctor, I'm here!<br>
DOCTOR: Osgood!<br>
OSGOOD [OC]: Doctor, I'm down here!<br>
DOCTOR: Osgood! <br>
OSGOOD [OC]: Doctor! <br>
(He finds the trap door under a carpet in either a cupboard or a small corridor.)<br>
  <br>
  <b>[Basement]</b><br>
  <br>
OSGOOD: Doctor! Doctor!<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor jumps down the ladder. and turns on a torch.)<br>
    </font>DOCTOR: Osgood! <br>
(A jet flies overhead. He finds her sitting, manacled.)<br>
DOCTOR: Got to get you out. They're going to bomb this place.
What do the Zygons want?<br>
OSGOOD: They're training, practising new skills. Doctor, what are you doing
here? <br>
(He sonicks her manacles.)<br>
DOCTOR: Rescuing you. In quite a dashing way, I might add.<br>
OSGOOD: They fled through the tunnels. They're going back to the UK. If
you're here, they've got you out of the way. Who's left in the UK?<br>
DOCTOR: Clara.<br>
ZYGON: Clara!<br>DOCTOR: Oh, hello.<br>(Whee Boom! Rocks fall on top of the Zygon.)<br>DOCTOR: They've started. So much for ten minutes. <br>(Boom!)<br>
<br><b>[Truth or Consequences]</b><br>
    <br>
KATE: You found something? What? What do you want me to see?<br>(Norlander opens a dumpster full of hair and sizzling electricity.)<br>
KATE: Oh, God. W-were those all people?<br>(Sizzling sounds are coming from more dumpsters nearby.)<br>
    <br>
    <b>[Tunnel]</b><br><br>
(A lift arrives. Jac, Clara and some soldiers get out.)<br>
JAC: It's an odd world nowadays, isn't it?<br>CLARA: It's always been an odd world.<br>
JAC: Mmm. I mean, doesn't it feel, sometimes, that things are coming to
an end? Everything's just going nuts.<br>
CLARA: You're middle-aged, that's what it is. No offence. Everybody
middle-aged always thinks the world's about to come to an end. Hmm. Never
does. It's here. Oh, my God. <br>
(Lots of Zygon tech.)<br>
    <br>
    <b>[Aeroplane]</b><br><br>
The Zygon is wheeled in tied to a box trolley. The Doctor follows, on his phone.)<br>
CLARA [OC]: Hi, this is Clara Oswald. I'm probably on the tube or in
outer space. Leave a message!<br>
DOCTOR: Can you change your voicemail message, please, it's getting
very boring.<br>
(Osgood is behind him and sits down.)<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see you've accessorised it.<br>OSGOOD: Yes.<br>
DOCTOR: The old question marks.<br>
OSGOOD: You used to wear question marks.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I know, yes, I did. <br>
OSGOOD: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They were nice. </font>Why don't you wear them any more?<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I do. I've got question mark underpants. <br>
OSGOOD: Makes one wonder
what the question is. <br>
(The Doctor pulls up another chair and sits down.)<br>
DOCTOR: Which one are you? Human or Zygon?<br>
OSGOOD: I don't answer that question.<br>
DOCTOR: Why not?<br>
OSGOOD: Because there isn't a question to answer. I don't accept it. My
sister and I were the living embodiment of the peace we made.
I will give all the lives that I have to protect it. You want to know who I
am, Doctor? I am the peace. I am Human <em>and</em> Zygon.<br>
DOCTOR: Like a hybrid.<br>
OSGOOD: A hybrid, if you like.<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm proud to know you, Osgood. And I promise that I won't
tell anyone that you're a human. Zygons need to keep the human original
alive to refresh the body print.
If you were a Zygon, you'd've changed back within days of your sister's
death.<br>
OSGOOD: Those were the old rules, before Zygons could pluck loved ones
from your memory and wear their faces.
Zygons only need to keep the original alive if they need more
information from them. If the interrogation is over, then the original
can die.
<br>
<br><b>[Tunnel]</b><br>
  <br>
(Faces illuminatied by red light.)<br>
JAC: Oh, my God. These are Zygon pods.<br>
(Lots of large scaley things attached to the roof and walls.)<br>CLARA: I think you might be right.<br>
JAC: About what?<br>
CLARA: The end of the world.<br><br>
  <b>[Aeroplane]</b><br><br>
(In the air. The Zygon roars.)<br>
DOCTOR: Bit of first-things-first-ness. What's your name? My name's. Well, you can call me the Doctor. But then you knew
that, didn't you? You want something. What is it?<br>
ZYGON: You are the President of the World?<br>
DOCTOR: I suppose so.<br>
ZYGON: We want the world.<br>(The Zygons laughs.)<br><br>
  <b>[Tunnel]</b><br>
  <br>
(Troops march in from the lift.)<br>
CLARA: Okay. It looks like whole buildings full of people have been pinched.
In fact, it looks like a whole London full of people have been pinched.
But we've got here early, they're still growing. We've have to
neutralise these before they hatch.
Take your positions.<br>(Gun bolts slide.)<br>CLARA: Do you know what? I'm enjoying this.<br>JAC: Clara. <br>
CLARA: What?<br>JAC: We don't know that's what these are.<br>
CLARA: Oh, come on. These are eggs, or pods, or whatever. Look. <br>
(She pulls the membrane from one pod 'window'.)<br>
CLARA: Oh,
my God, that's me.<br>JAC: I think we should wait.<br>
CLARA: Look, they're here. They're growing duplicates of us. We have
to destroy them. I've seen this happen before. It happened to that little boy. They took
his parents and then they took him.<br>JAC: But I don't see how these <i>are</i><i></i> duplicates. That's not how Zygons work. They don't grow duplicates, <i>they</i><i></i> kidnap the originals. So these, these <i>are</i><i></i> the humans. Retreat. Retreat! This is a trap! This is an ambush!<br>
(A large number of Zygons are there. Clara is calm and smiling slightly.)<br>JAC: No. Oh, no, Miss Oswald, please. Please!<br>CLARA: Kill the traitors.<br>(Lots of screaming while Clara recalls what happened in Sandeep's flat.)<br>CLARA [memory]: Is he okay?<br>
(A Zygon stood behind Sandeep's Mum and zapped Clara, then her duplicate appeared.)<br>CLARA-Z [memory]: Hello, Clara. My name is Bonnie. <br>
(The UNIT troops have been reduced to hairballs.)<br>
  <br>
  <b>[A</b><b>eroplane</b><b>]</b><br>
  <br>
ZYGON: We want the truth of who we are to be
acknowledged. We want to live as ourselves.
At any cost. We want a home.<br>
DOCTOR: Well, you can't have the United Kingdom. There's already people
living there. They'll think you're going to pinch their benefits.<br>ZYGON: We're already there, Doctor. The invasion's already taken
place, bit by bit, over the last year. We've won the first battle.
And now, we are going to begin the war.<br>
  <br>
  <b>[Sheriff's Office]</b><br><br>
(Kate is going through more files when Norlander comes in. It is night, 11.01 according to the clock. Insects are chirping.)<br>
NORLANDER: There's hundreds more. They killed everybody.<br>KATE: We have to find out what forms they took, how many of them there were. How did this happen? <br>NORLANDER: Somebody once caught the briefest of glimpses of a Zygon in its proper
form. A child who hadn't learned to preserve its body print, who had
been left alone to learn these things for itself. And then word went
round these primitives that we were monsters. <br>
KATE: We?<br>NORLANDER: There isn't any backup, is there? I just had to be sure.<br>(Norlander transforms into a Zygon and reaches for Kate. In the UNIT safe house, Zygon-Clara is making a call.)<br>
CLARA-Z [OC]: Commander calling Truth or Consequences. What is your
status? Repeat, Commander calling Truth or Consequences. What is
your status?
  <br>
(Presumably the Kate who uses Zygon tech to reply is a Zygon, but we cannot be sure.)<br>
KATE-Z: Commander, UNIT neutralised in North America. Truth or Consequences.<br><br>
  <b>[UNIT Safe House]</b><br>
  <br>
CLARA-Z: Copy that.<br>(She goes to the armoury and unlocks it, and takes a case from a rack. Then she logs into the computer and uses her phone.)<br>
CLARA-Z: Bonnie speaking. UNIT neutralised in the UK. More or less.<br>
(The screen shows the position of the Doctor's plane returning to the UK. Clara-Z watches it from a cliff top and makes a call.)<br><br>
  <b>[Aeroplane]</b><br>
  <br>
ZYGON: Answer it. Say goodbye. This plane will never land.<br>
DOCTOR: Really. Clara?<br>

  <b>[Cliff top]</b><br><br>
CLARA-Z: Doctor.<br>

  <b>[Aeroplane]</b><br>
DOCTOR: Clara? <br>

  <b>[Cliff top]</b><br>
  <br>
CLARA-Z: There you are. <br>
(The case contains a missile launcher. She puts her phone on speaker and takes it out to target the aeroplane.)<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Clara, I'm glad you're okay. Listen.<br>
CLARA-Z: You're breaking up. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: The invasion has happened. You're probably surrounded by
Zygons. Get to the Tardis, get yourself safe.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>[Aeroplane]</b><br>
  <br>
DOCTOR: And apparently my plane is never going to land, but let's see what
we're going to do about that. <br><br>
  <b>[Cliff top]</b><br>
  <br>
CLARA-Z: I'm sorry, but Clara's dead. <br>
  <br>
  <b>[Aeroplane]<br>
    <br>
  </b>CLARA-Z [OC]: Kate Stewart is dead. The UNIT
troops are all dead. <br>
