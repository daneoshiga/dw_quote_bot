the stars when the Tardis materialises inside it.) <br>
ADRIC: Oh, we've stopped. We're there, Nyssa. Get the Doctor, will you?
<br>
NYSSA: Yes. <br>
(The Doctor enters with Tegan.) <br>
ADRIC: We've arrived. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. A bit ahead of schedule. When was your flight again? <br>
TEGAN: A778, seventeen thirty hours. <br>
DOCTOR: February the twenty eighth, 1981. Oh, you'll have time for a
cup of tea. It's only sixteen fifteen hours. <br>
(But the scanner shows a spaceship compartment with strange technical
equipment in it.) <br>
TEGAN: Doesn't look much like Heathrow to me. <br>
DOCTOR: Last time I was there, they were doing strange things to
Terminal three. Oh. No, you're right. It doesn't. <br>
ADRIC: Well, don't look at me. I set the coordinates as you instructed.
Six three zero niner in the inner spiral arm of Galaxia Kiklos. <br>
TEGAN: But Heathrow is on the M4, not Corfu. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Adric's just showing off. He means the Milky Way, your
galaxy. Ha! Massive magnetic field shift. <br>
ADRIC: Looks like some kind of a control room. <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose it could be part of the Piccadilly Line. <br>
TEGAN: Good. Then I can catch a train. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, no, wait, wait, wait. The atmosphere's wrong. <br>
TEGAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Diminution of oxygen, nitrogen, traces of mercurial compound,
intense proton activity. <br>
(The Doctor goes through the inner door.) <br>
NYSSA: I thought Earth was meant to be primitive. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, did you. <br>
NYSSA: Their instrumentation is very advanced. That looks like a
resonant stroboscope. <br>
TEGAN: What's that when it's at home? <br>
NYSSA: But it is home. <br>
(The Doctor returns with a helmet that has a pair of oxygen cylinders
attached to the back.) <br>
DOCTOR: Er, I'm going to take a look around. Now, none of you is to
leave here. Is that clearly understood? Good. <br>
(He puts on the helmet, opens the door and leaves.) </font></p>

delight at the equipment he finds. He flicks a switch on a panel then
quickly flicks it back again. As he continues to explore, a black ball
floats in the air behind him, watching. The Doctor goes to the
bulkhead, flicks another switch and a shutter on a porthole opens to
reveal the stars.) <br>
DOCTOR: Spaceship or laboratory? </font></p>

speaks, although we don't see anyone yet.) <br>
MONARCH [OC]: I would look at the intrusion again. <br>
(The ball backs up to show the Tardis.) <br>
MONARCH [OC]: Well? <br>
(A woman replies.) <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT [OC]: It is not in my memory. <br>
(A second man speaks.) <br>
PERSUASION [OC]: Nor in mine. <br>
MONARCH [OC]: I would look again at the humanoid. <br>

TEGAN: He's taking his time. <br>
ADRIC: Yes. I've never known him hurry anything. <br>
(Nyssa is reading Principia Mathematica by Alfred North Whitehead
instead of watching the scanner.) <br>
TEGAN: Is there another space pack? <br>
ADRIC: Yes. <br>
NYSSA: He told us to stay here. <br>
TEGAN: Well, perhaps he's in trouble. <br>
ADRIC: Oh, he's always in trouble, Tegan, or haven't you noticed? It
amuses him. <br>
TEGAN: Well, it doesn't amuse me. He promised to get me back to
Heathrow. He'll lose me my job. <br>
ADRIC: No, he won't. Be patient. <br>
TEGAN: Patient? After all I've been through since I came through that
door? My aunt reduced to so long. You must be joking. <br>
ADRIC: Look, we're fifth dimensional in this thing. He'll get you on
your flight if he's out there a week. <br>
TEGAN: And what do we do in the meantime? <br>
ADRIC: You could always read. <br>
TEGAN: Read? <br>
ADRIC: Yes. There's a fascinating book on maths through there by a chap
called Burt Russell. <br>
TEGAN: Maths? <br>
ADRIC: That's the trouble with women. Mindless, impatient and bossy. <br>
TEGAN: You chauvinist. I heard that. <br>
ADRIC: You were meant to. <br>
NYSSA: I heard it too. You mean this? Mindless. <br>
ADRIC: Well, yes, but you're not a woman. <br>
NYSSA: I'm not? <br>
ADRIC: No. You're only a girl. </font></p>

<br>
NYSSA: Still no sign of him. <br>
ADRIC: Can't be far. <br>
NYSSA: How do you know? <br>
ADRIC: By the look of things, there's not really very far he can go. <br>
NYSSA: You don't know that either. Just look at that. <br>
ADRIC: What does that thing do? <br>
NYSSA: I thought you knew all about it. It increases density. <br>
ADRIC: What for? <br>
NYSSA: To reduce matter, of course. <br>
ADRIC: What matter? <br>
NYSSA: The Doctor's, perhaps? <br>
ADRIC: That's ridiculous. <br>
NYSSA: Is it? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Well, we're in motion, so we can be pretty
sure it's a spaceship. <br>
TEGAN: So much for promises. You've lost me my job. <br>
DOCTOR: Patience. <br>
TEGAN: Men. <br>
DOCTOR: And it appears to be unmanned. Adric, through there, space
packs. No need to bother with the visors. <br>
ADRIC: Yes, Doctor. <br>
(Adric leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: There's a lot to interest you out there, young lady. Highly
advanced, innovative stuff. <br>
NYSSA: That's a resonant stroboscope, isn't it. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. There appears to be nothing but machinery out there, but
we are under scrutiny. There's a monopticon out there. <br>
NYSSA: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose it would be best described as a sort of mobile
black eye with a hypnotic stare. <br>
(Adric returns with the helmets.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoever or whatever is running this ship knows we're here, so
we'll have a little scrutiny for ourselves. Should we meet anyone, you
take your cue from me. (to Tegan) Spare key. Should we be separated, we
come back here. <br>
TEGAN: But can't I stay here? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, if you like, stay here. Adric? <br>
(Tegan snatches the key.) <br>
TEGAN: No, I'll come. </font></p>

Non-corrosive alloys, saturated polymers. Highly advanced. <br>
NYSSA: Look at that! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! An interferometer. <br>
ADRIC: What's that? <br>
NYSSA: This one's for measuring gravitation waves. <br>
DOCTOR: But we could use it on the time curve circuits. <br>
NYSSA: Look, a graviton crystal detector. <br>
ADRIC: What's that for? <br>
NYSSA: Same thing. <br>
DOCTOR: Belts and braces. <br>
NYSSA: Except on Traken, the interferometer superceded the crystal. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. That's what's interesting. See if you can get it going. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MONARCH [OC]: I would again look closer at the
tallest. He would appear to be the senior. <br>

you tell me who or what you are? And where we are? </font></p>

DOCTOR: I, er, I know we're trespassing, but I would like an
opportunity to explain the circumstances, if you'd be so kind. <br>
ADRIC: Doctor, don't we have some kind of a sonic <br>
(The Doctor gestures Adric to be quiet.) <br>
DOCTOR: So, your lips are sealed. Well, would it be in order for you to
take me to your leader? If you have a leader, that is. <br>
TEGAN: Look! A door! <br>
(A second door slides open at the top of a stairway.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, that's a friendly gesture. Thank you. Er, perhaps one
of us should stay with Nyssa, Adric. <br>
ADRIC: No! <br>

NYSSA: Calm down. It won't bite. <br>
ADRIC: How do you know? <br>
NYSSA: Because. <br>
ADRIC: I don't know why the Doctor made me stay here anyway. <br>
NYSSA: Come over here. <br>

detector.) <br>

obviously reflects a different culture. <br>
PERSUASION [OC]: How can Earthlings have penetrated us? <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT [OC]: Can they have learned the error of their ways? Are
they now pacified and cooperative? Is our arrival to be simpler than
expected? <br>
MONARCH [OC]: More. Can their technology now be advanced as mine? </font></p>

equipment, but it is too heavy for them.) <br>

where the time curve circuits are, don't you? <br>
ADRIC: Of course. <br>
NYSSA: Well, fetch them. I'll set up. <br>

the Doctor and Tegan enter. They are seated high up above their
subjects, with Monarch highest of all, and wearing voluminous green
gowns that hide their shapes. This is effectively the bridge of the
spaceship, where they watch everything on a bank of monitors in front
of them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here we are. <br>
TEGAN: At last. <br>
MONARCH: Welcome. I am Monarch. <br>
(Tegan gasps at the greenish rough skin of the alien in charge.) <br>
DOCTOR: You look as if you might be. <br>

ENLIGHTENMENT: How do you do. <br>
MONARCH: And this is Persuasion. <br>
DOCTOR: Friendly, I hope. <br>
MONARCH: And you are? <br>
DOCTOR: I am the Doctor. <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT: A doctor? Of what? <br>
DOCTOR: Of everything. <br>
PERSUASION: How modest. <br>
MONARCH: An Earthling. <br>
DOCTOR: A Gallifreyan. Tegan is an Earthling, Adric is an Alzarian, and
Nyssa there is from Traken.) <br>
(Nyssa is on the monitor.) <br>
PERSUASION: You come in peace? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. And inadvertently, as a matter of fact. <br>
MONARCH: Control, release full life support atmosphere, please. Remove
your encumbrances. <br>
(The Doctor and Tegan take off their helmets.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. May I ask who you are? <br>
MONARCH: I am the supreme leader of the people of Urbanka, in the solar
system of Inokshi in the galaxy RA one four eight nine. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodness me, you are a long way from home. <br>
MONARCH: As indeed are you. You must be tired. Control, refreshments
for our guests. <br>
DOCTOR: You're very kind. <br>
MONARCH: I am merely civilised. <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT: Is that what the best-dressed Earthling women are
wearing these days? <br>
TEGAN: These days? <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT: It's two and a half thousand years since we were last
there. <br>
TEGAN: Two thousand five hundred years? <br>
MONARCH: Yes, our planets are rather far apart. We come as often as we
can. Control, isolate the girl. <br>
(Monarch is keeping a close eye on what Nyssa is doing.) <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I drop in from time to time myself, and nothing on
Earth changes quite so often as the fashion. You wouldn't believe the
way some people look. Some of them even wear safety pins. <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT: Safety pins? <br>
PERSUASION: A defence mechanism? <br>
DOCTOR: Earrings. <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT: How barbaric. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. A lot of it about. <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT: Are you fashionable, Tegan? <br>
TEGAN: This is my uniform. <br>
ENLIGHTENMENT: What is your manner of dress when not in uniform? <br>
TEGAN: It's difficult to explain. Have you got a piece of paper? <br>
(The Doctor hands over a notebook.) <br>
TEGAN: Thanks. Pen? Pencil? <br>
(A propelling pencil.) <br>
TEGAN: That'll do. <br>

DOCTOR: Drop in times? <br>
MONARCH: Your visits to planet Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I promised to put Tegan on her plane. <br>
MONARCH: Her astral plane? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, in a sense. They go from Heathrow Airport. <br>
MONARCH: This is not Heathrow Airport. <br>
DOCTOR: No, not even the quarantine area. <br>
MONARCH: Forgive my curiosity as to how your craft came aboard. <br>
DOCTOR: An error. My assistant miscalculated the coordinates. <br>
TEGAN: Too right he did. <br>
DOCTOR: Or it could have been your dense magnetic field causing a
fluctuation of my artron energy. <br>
MONARCH: What energy is that? <br>
(Adric is on his way to the bridge.) <br>
MONARCH: You possess an energy you do not understand? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Silly, isn't it. Only my professor at the Academy seemed
to understand it. Just goes to show how academic everything is. <br>
MONARCH: Hmm. Ah, the boy who got his sums wrong. <br>
ADRIC: No, I didn't. I'm a mathematician. <br>
MONARCH: Mathematician, eh? Well, what do you understand by e=mc2 <br>
ADRIC: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Adric, explain the formula. <br>
ADRIC: Doctor, where's Nyssa? Energy equals mass time the speed of
light squared. <br>
MONARCH: You grasp the theory of relativity? <br>
ADRIC: Doesn't everyone? <br>
TEGAN: No, I don't. And if we don't get back to Heathrow, I'm going to
lose my job. <br>
ADRIC: Study maths and you might get a better one. <br>
TEGAN: I don't want a better one. <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, children. Not in front of our hosts. <br>

short-sightedly.) <br>
MONARCH: You will be escorted to your refreshments. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Monarch. <br>
PERSUASION: Majesty. <br>
DOCTOR: Majesty. <br>
(The Doctor, Tegan and Adric leave. Enlightenment looks at the sketch
of a man in a double-breasted suit, and a woman in shift dress with
leggings.) <br>
MONARCH: Well done, Enlightenment. These will eliminate the need for
telemicrographics, and may prove to be more reliable. I would inspect
their craft. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Sloppy thinking, Adric. Do you know there are at least three
billion bacteria in this chamber alone? And if a frog with a funny head

nothing of the dress-making. <br>

NYSSA: A science concerned with the control mechanisms of machines. <br>

peculiar human beings. <br>

Earth on a spaceship with three billion and three frogs. And four
Earthlings. Why? Wait a minute, wait a minute. How long is one hundred
generations? <br>
ADRIC: What's generation in years? <br>
DOCTOR: Call it twenty five. <br>
ADRIC: Two thousand five hundred years. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Right. So it's at least two thousand five hundred years
since our hosts last visited Earth when they rescued Bigon. Now, if the
return journey to Urbanka takes the same time as the journey to Earth.
How's your ancient history, Tegan? <br>
TEGAN: Like I feel, awful. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, not to worry, mine's pretty good. Now, the Futu dynasty
in China I would put at four thousand years ago, the Mayans in South
American flourished eight thousand years ago, and Kurkutji the
aborigine says it's so long since he was taken he can't remember. How
about twelve thousand years? <br>
TEGAN: But that's mad. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so you keep saying, Tegan. Is anyone saying you're wrong? <br>
ADRIC: I am. I think it's brilliant. <br>
NYSSA: So do I. Pure logic. <br>
DOCTOR: Or maybe Tegan's right. Why do it? <br>
TEGAN: Are you saying that this aborigine was taken twelve thousand
years ago? <br>
DOCTOR: No, but his ancestor was. Wouldn't be the first time that whole
generations have known of no other life than a spaceship. <br>
TEGAN: Then what are you saying? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm saying that the Urbankans have visited Earth four times and
taken at least one cultural representative, and this time they're
coming for good. Well, I say good. Three billion Earthlings plus three
billion Urbankans, I really don't think so. I really don't think so at
all. <br>

frame. <br>
TEGAN: It's wicked. Evil. <br>
BIGON: Not in itself. As with all technology, it is the use to which it
is put. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just three silicon chips. <br>
BIGON: My reasoning chip contains more circuits than there are synapses
in your brain, Doctor, each linked by lines one hundred nanometres
thick. <br>
TEGAN: What's a nanometre? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, a thousand millionth of a metre. <br>
TEGAN: No. I'm sorry, I can't believe that. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, like it or not, Tegan, you're looking at a fact, if not a
fact of life. This ship contains the entire population of Urbanka. Nine
billion silicon chips. <br>
BIGON: Not so many. Some are slaves, robots. They have but one chip,
the motor circuit. Those are they that wear the discs. <br>
DOCTOR: So, the Aborigine, the Chinaman and the Mayan are <br>
BIGON: All as I, yes. The leaders of four ethnic groups. </font></p>
