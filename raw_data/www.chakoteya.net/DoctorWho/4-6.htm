JAMIE: What's he done? <br>
BEN: Doctor, do something! <br>
DOCTOR: I'm trying to! <br>
JAMIE: We're not going to make it. <br>
(Everyone is being thrown across the room and back as the Doctor fights
the controls. Soon everything settles down.) <br>
DOCTOR: I have it back in control again. <br>
BEN: Here, we're landing. Look. Coming at a fair rate. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, thank the Lord for that. You know, Doctor, I'll never ask
you to do that again. <br>
DOCTOR: Huh? Oh, no. There must have been a reason for that. <br>
POLLY: Anyway, Doctor, you've done it. It's Mars. It must be. You're
landing the Tardis exactly where you said you would. <br>
(The Tardis materialises amongst magnificent desolation.) <br>
BEN: Hey, wait a mo! This don't look like Mars to me. <br>
POLLY: How would you know? You never seen it. <br>
BEN: No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon's surface and
that's what this looks like. <br>
JAMIE: That's the moon? <br>
POLLY: Doctor, is it the moon? <br>
(The Doctor nods.) <br>
BEN: Oh, well, you weren't too far out, were you? Only about two
hundred million miles. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, let's move on. While we can. <br>
POLLY: Now wait a minute! <br>
BEN: What? <br>
POLLY: You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just
like that, do you? <br>
BEN: Yeah, at least let us have a look around! <br>
JAMIE: That picture canna be the moon. The moon's way up in the sky. <br>
DOCTOR: Where do you think you're going? <br>
BEN: You're not going to tell us there's no shore leave. <br>
POLLY: Ah, please, Doctor. The Tardis isn't out of control or anything
is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. It was just a bumpy landing, that's all. <br>
BEN: Yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you must go ashore, only half an hour. <br>
BEN: Right. <br>
POLLY: Super. <br>
DOCTOR: You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits. There's no
atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest. <br>
(Jamie is still staring at the scanner.) <br>
JAMIE: We'll maybe meet the old man in the moon. <br>
BEN: You won't meet nobody mate if you don't get some gear on. <br>
JAMIE: What? Oh aye.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Some time later, all four of them are suited up
and they leave the Tardis to look around.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on now, let's go over here. <br>
POLLY: Hey, look at this. <br>
DOCTOR: It's deserted. <br>
JAMIE: I don't think I like it. <br>
(Polly sees a pulsating light.) <br>
POLLY: Look, over there. <br>
JAMIE: I'll don't see anything. <br>
BEN: What did you see? <br>
POLLY: Some sort of great glow in the sky. <br>
BEN: It's probably your eyes getting used to the lunar light, hey,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly. <br>
POLLY: What do we need these great clogs for? <br>
DOCTOR: Try a little jump. <br>
POLLY: All right. <br>
(Polly takes a small jump and rises about ten feet, falling slowly and
rolling gently as she lands. Ben and Jamie copy her and collide.) <br>
DOCTOR: Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate. <br>
POLLY: You never told me you'd taken ballet lessons, Ben. <br>
(Polly takes a big jump to a the crater rim.) <br>
POLLY: Come on, it's easy. <br>
BEN: Look out, here I come. <br>
(Jamie jumps too far and goes over the rim and out of sight.) <br>
POLLY: Where's he gone? <br>
BEN: Over there. <br>
(From the rim of the crater they look down on a large domed building.) <br>
POLLY: What on Earth? Look! <br>
BEN: Blimey! What is it? <br>
POLLY: Doctor, what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
POLLY: Hey, I can see Jamie. There he is. <br>
(Jamie is lying unconscious by the dome.) <br>
BEN: Hey, there's somebody coming out. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, let's go. <br>
(Two spacesuited figures come out of the dome's airlock and take Jamie
inside. The Doctor, Ben and Polly hurry to the dome and Ben knocks on
the airlock. Then it slides open. After a brief pause, they all go in.)

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The moonbase is a weather control centre. A small
team of scientists govern weather patterns on Earth using a powerful
device called the Gravitron. A map of the Earth dominates one wall, and
the Gravitron probe is in a transparent dome on one side of the room
with it's power controls in an insulated room. Each person wears a
numbered uniform, and the gravitron technicians wear protective
headgear. They are monitoring a Pacific hurricane or typhoon when one
of the workers collapses. An alarm sounds.) <br>
BENOIT: (2nd in command, French) What on Earth is it? <br>
(Played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0544860/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Andre
Maranne</a>, possibly the only genuine French actor the BBC
knew.) <br>
(A web of black lines covers the stricken man's face.) <br>
HOBSON: (base commander) I don't know. Get him along to the Medical
unit. <br>
BENOIT: But Doctor Evans has gone down with it as well. <br>
HOBSON: Yes, I know that but the relief Doctor from Earth should be
here on the next shuttle rocket. <br>
BENOIT: Yes, yes, of course. Bob, give me a hand, will you? <br>
BOB: Yes, right. <br>
(Benoit and Bob carry the man out.) <br>
HOBSON: And Jules, you take over. Come on, it won't bite you. There
must be some source to this infection. Look, we'd better get the lads
in here and tell them what's happening. Get them on the blower, would
you, Nils? <br>
NILS: (the number 3, Danish) Okay, Hobby. (into intercom) Nils
speaking. We, er, we've got a bit of a flap on up here. <br>
(Hobson is distracted by the arrival of the Doctor, Polly and Ben next
door.) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>[Reception room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NILS [OC]: Mister Hobson wants a word with you all
in weather control room. Quick as you can. <br>
HOBSON: Hello. Where did you lot spring from? Don't tell me the shuttle
rocket's arrived already? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it hasn't. <br>
SAM: There was another one with them, sir. Bob's taken him along to the
Medical unit. He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or
something. <br>
HOBSON: Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already. Have they
been through the sterile room? <br>
SAM: Yes, Hobby. <br>
DOCTOR: We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our
young friend and we'll be off. <br>
HOBSON: Hey, not so fast. <br>
POLLY: Please, let me go and see Jamie. <br>
BENOIT: I will take you there, mademoiselle, if you come with me. <br>
HOBSON: All right, young lady. You can carry on. <br>
BENOIT: This way. <br>
(Polly and Benoit leave.) <br>
HOBSON: But I'd just like to have a word with you two. You could do
with a extra bacteria check by the look of it. <br>
DOCTOR: Bacteria check? <br>
HOBSON: That's what I said. <br>
BEN: Well, thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll have you know our Tardis is as sterile as <br>
HOBSON: Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Our space craft. <br>
NILS: They're all here, sir. Any time you're ready. <br>
HOBSON: Right. Well, we'll learn about your spacecraft a little later.
Meanwhile, you'd better come along with me, meet my team and listen to
what I have to say. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you very much.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>[Control room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HOBSON: Well, you know what this place is? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre? Ah,
yes. And that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's
the culprit, then. <br>
BEN: Ay? <br>
DOCTOR: That's what gave us such a bumpy landing. Some sort of gravity
device? <br>
HOBSON: Some sort of gravity device. You are from Earth, aren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
HOBSON: Well, where've you been for the past 20 years. Every school kid
knows about the Gravitron in there. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. It must be about the year 2050, Ben. <br>
HOBSON: We've got a proper Rip Van Winkle here. It's 2070, in case
you'd like to know. <br>
DOCTOR: There you are. I was only twenty years out. <br>
HOBSON: Well, before we all forget what century we're in, I'd better
tell you why I've called you here. <br>
DOCTOR: Won't you introduce us first? I am a Doctor. <br>
HOBSON: A Doctor? You're arrived just in time. We need your help. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Do you? <br>
HOBSON: I'll see you in a moment. Now, this virus <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I may be able to help you if you'll introduce us. <br>
HOBSON: Right, Doctor. You'd better meet them all. We're all scientists
here, you see. No room for idle hands, I see to that. Roger Benoit,
beside you there, is my assistant. He takes over as Chief Scientist if
anything happens to me. He's a physicist like me and Joe Benson there.
Nils, our mad Dane, is an astronomer and mathematician as is Charlie
here. Ralph, Jules and Franz are geologists. When they're not acting as
cooks, looks-outs, general and, you know, handymen. <br>
DOCTOR: And this is where you control the Earth's weather? I see. <br>
BENOIT: The gravitron there controls the tides, the tides controls the
weather. And from this console here we plot it all on that map. Simple,
eh? <br>
BEN: Oh, yeah, very simple. Wish we'd had all this back in 1966. <br>
DOCTOR: Was it a bad year then? <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
BEN: What's that? What's happened? <br>
(A man has collapsed inside the gravitron chamber.) <br>
HOBSON: It's Jim. Quick, Franz, take over here. <br>
(Franz puts on a helmet and goes into the chamber. Ralph and John carry
Jim to the medical unit.) <br>
BENOIT: Indicator Five over the Pacific is starting to move. <br>
BEN: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Some form of change in the weather. <br>
HOBSON: We're soon hear from Earth what it means. <br>
NILS: Here it comes! <br>

NILS: Moonport standing by. <br>
HOBSON: Hobson here. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding
is now 45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii. <br>
HOBSON: One of my men was taken ill. We're operational again now. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: The controller would like to know the cause of the
illness. <br>
HOBSON: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this
mystery virus in the past few hours, including the doctor. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. <br>
HOBSON: Just hang on another couple of minutes, lads. We'd better hear
what the great Mister Rinberg has to say. <br>
NILS: Hobby? <br>
HOBSON: Yes. <br>
NILS: There it is again. I'll play it back to you. <br>
HOBSON [OC]: Yes, so would we. We've now got three men down with this
mystery virus in the past few hours, including the Doctor. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. <br>
NILS: Hear the big noise ratio on that re-run? We're being monitored
again. <br>
HOBSON: Monitored? <br>
NILS: Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every
word we say. <br>

the dome, monitoring the conversation.) <br>
HOBSON [OC]: Well? <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Your instructions are to send blood samples back to Earth
for investigation. <br>
HOBSON [OC]: Well, when can we do that? The next shuttle rocket's not
for another month. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Then they must be put on that rocket. In the meantime the
Moonbase is to be put in quarantine.

HOBSON: Oh, never mind about that now. That Rinberg fellow just won't
talk to you. How can we trace down this mystery illness with the doctor
himself down with it. <br>
DOCTOR: We'd better get out of these things and see how Jamie is.
Perhaps I could be of help in the sick bay now. <br>
HOBSON: Anything you can do. Bob! <br>
BOB: Yes, Mister Hobson? <br>
HOBSON: Show him to the Medical unit, will you? <br>
BOB: Yes, of course, sir. Will you come this way, please. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you. <br>
(Bob, Ben and the Doctor leave.) <br>
HOBSON: Well, you all heard the position. We don't know what this
infection is or how it got into the base, but I want you all to take
extra precautions while this emergency is on. We may be short-handed
for quite a while.

chest.) <br>
POLLY: Is this how it goes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Then this unit automatically controls the
pulse, the temperature and the breathing. <br>
POLLY: A sort of electronic doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Almost got striped trousers. <br>
BEN: And it even gives him medicines too? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it will do very nearly everything. <br>
POLLY: It can't be nice to him. Oh dear. How do you think he is,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish, but
he'll be all right with rest. <br>
JAMIE: The Piper. The McCrimmon Piper. Don't let him get me! <br>
DOCTOR: Piper? <br>
POLLY: Some legend of his clan. As far as I can make out, this piper
appears to a McCrimmon just before he dies. <br>
DOCTOR: Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet? <br>
POLLY: You don't believe it, do you? <br>
DOCTOR: No, but he does. It's important to him. <br>
POLLY: He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Well, we'll see whether we can do just that. <br>
BEN: Well, carry on, nurse. <br>
POLLY: Well, at least I tried to help. With a ward full of sick men and
no doctor, somebody's got to do something. <br>
(A patient is groaning.) <br>
POLLY: I wonder who this is? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't get too near, Polly. Have a look on his chart. <br>
POLLY: Yes, that's a good idea. <br>
BEN: It's Doctor Evans. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it. <br>
POLLY: He looks one of the worst. <br>
DOCTOR: There's something about this epidemic that I don't quite
understand. It's not like a real disease at all. It's almost as if <br>
BEN: Not real? What more do you want? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which
don't add up. Ben, I want you to go along to the control room and keep
an eye on things. <br>
BEN: Well, how? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Give a hand, do anything, but keep your eyes and
ears open. <br>

HOBSON: How can I rest with that thing up the spout. You know the score
as well as I do. Five units off centre we lift half London into space.
Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet. Rinberg just
doesn't understand the pressure we're under. Hey, you! What do you
thinking you're doing skulking there? <br>
BEN: Well, I was just wondering if I can help, sir. <br>
HOBSON: Help? How could you help? <br>
BENOIT: We could do with an extra pair of hands. He can help me. <br>
HOBSON: Well, keep him away from me, that's all. All right, I'll go and
lie down. Call me if anything happens. <br>
BENOIT: Yes, of course. <br>
HOBSON: Oh, by the way. There were two more of those momentary drops in
air pressure while I was on. I've put them in the log. <br>

be helpful. And er, oh er, Ralph, that is, no. 14, needs a hand down in

are you responsible for the broken bags here. <br>

most likely. <br>

cycle. <br>

the moon they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights. <br>
POLLY: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's obvious, isn't it? They have to make their own day
and night artificially up here, or it would upset their whole
biological time clock. <br>

silver figure in front of him. It has a blank metal face with round eye
holes and a slit for the mouth. Tubes come from where its ears should
be and connect at a round device on the top of it's head. We seen
something like this before, but Jamie hasn't.) <br>
JAMIE: No! No, I'll not go with you. Do you hear me, piper? No, leave
me. Leave me, I'll not go with you, do you hear me? Leave me. No, I'll
not go with you. <br>

No. <br>

(Polly returns with the water for Jamie. She screams. Hobson, the
Doctor, Ben and two other men run in.) <br>
DOCTOR: Polly! Polly, what's happened? <br>
POLLY: Oh, Doctor! Doctor, it was horrible. A great creature like a,
like a Cyberman. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. Don't be frightened. Whatever it was, it's all
gone now. <br>
POLLY: Yes, but Doctor, the Cyberman was carrying one of the patients
out! <br>
DOCTOR: Cyberman? <br>
HOBSON: Cyberman? What are you talking about? <br>
POLLY: I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was! <br>
DOCTOR: Are you sure? <br>
JAMIE: I'll not go with you! <br>
BEN: All right, mate. You're safe now. Take it easy. <br>
POLLY: Yes it did, I promise you. <br>
HOBSON: She's right. There's another one gone. Sam, Jules, you've got
to find these men. They can't just disappear in a place this size.
Search every square inch, don't come back until you've found them. Now
move. <br>
(Sam and Jules leave.) <br>
HOBSON: Now, supposing you tell me your story. What did you see? <br>
POLLY: Well, I went out to get Jamie some water and when I came back I
saw this giant man or creature or something just going out of the door
carrying one of the patients like a doll. I think it was a Cyberman. <br>
HOBSON: Forget the Cyberman part. Then what? <br>
POLLY: Well, then nothing. The door shut and then you came in. <br>
HOBSON: What do you know about all this? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. <br>
HOBSON: We'll see about that in a minute. This thing you saw, what was
it like? <br>
POLLY: It was enormous and silver, and it had holes in it's head for
eyes, like a robot! <br>
HOBSON: A robot? <br>
BEN: But the Cybermen were all killed when Mondas blew up, weren't
they? <br>
HOBSON: Stop this Cyberman nonsense. There were Cybermen, every child
knows that, but they were all destroyed ages ago. <br>
DOCTOR: So we all thought. <br>
HOBSON: That's enough. Now let's have a little calm thinking. For the
past two weeks a completely unknown disease has appeared in the base.
People drop in their tracks, they develop this black pattern on their
skin. Then some of the patients disappear, right? Well, they can't
leave the base without wearing space suits, and there are no space
suits missing, so where are they? <br>
DOCTOR: I must say it does sound a little odd. <br>
HOBSON: More than a little. Well I do know one thing. A new disease
starts, people disappear and then you turn up. <br>
POLLY: And you think we did it. <br>
BEN: Oh, come off it, we haven't done a thing. <br>
HOBSON: That's as maybe. I don't know who you are, what you are or
where you come
from. But you can get off the moon now. <br>
BEN: Yeah, well that suits me fine. The sooner the better. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Ben. We can't go yet. <br>
BEN: Well, why not? They don't want us here. <br>
DOCTOR: Because there is something evil here and we must stay. <br>
HOBSON: Evil? Don't be daft. <br>
DOCTOR: Evil is what I meant. There are some corners of the universe
which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against
everything that we believe in. They must be fought. This disease, for
instance. It isn't really a disease at all, but I can help you with it.
You'll see. I'll find the cause for you. <br>
HOBSON: Will you, indeed? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things, that's
all. It should be simple. <br>
HOBSON: Well, I'm not sure. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you
just one Earth day cycle to find the cause. <br>
BEN: Earth what? <br>
HOBSON: Twenty four hours. <br>
BEN: But that's no time at all. <br>
HOBSON: It's all the time you're going to get. Then you get off the
moon, complete with this bloke here. <br>
POLLY: But you can't move him. He's very ill. <br>
DOCTOR: We accept. Now tell me, you have pathological equipment here,
yes? <br>
HOBSON: Yes, Evans was working on an extensive research project. It's
all in here. <br>
(They go to an area marked off by a ring of workbenches and shelves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll have a look in here. <br>
HOBSON: It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped to deal with a full
scale epidemic, you understand. Do you think you can manage? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can. <br>
HOBSON: Right. Well, I'll leave you to it. But don't forget, twenty
four hours. <br>
(Hobson leaves. The Doctor takes a tray of items over to a patient.) <br>
BEN: What are you going to do, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: We're going to start with this one. <br>
POLLY: Listen, are you really a medical doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I was once, Polly. I think I took a degree once in
Glasgow. 1888 I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you? <br>
(The Doctor swabs a black-lined hand, and the arm convulses.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. He's quite unconscious. <br>
BEN: Well look, what can we do to help? <br>
DOCTOR: I shall need to examine everything. Clothes, boots, food,
towels, soap, everything. Will you get them for me, please? <br>
POLLY: Have you any idea what it might be? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Not an idea. But we'll find it out.

lack of co-ordination somewhere. <br>
BENOIT: Yes, but where? <br>

BENOIT: The fault must be in the gravitron. <br>
HOBSON: Nils, here. <br>

RINBERG [OC]: Controller Rinberg speaking. Is that you, Hobson? <br>
HOBSON: Yes, Rinberg. <br>
RINBERG [OC]: The directional fields are showing a progressive error.
Reports have come in of wide-spread pressure fluctuations in Atlantic
zone 6. You must get the gravitron back into balance. <br>
HOBSON: We're trying to compensate by re-aligning the probe. We have an
error in the servos. <br>
RINBERG [OC]: Well, there's no sign of any improvement here. We've just
had a report from Miami, Florida. Thirty minutes ago they were enjoying
clear skies and a heat wave. Now Hurricane Lucy is right overhead. <br>

HOBSON: What's that? <br>
BENOIT: Shut it down. <br>
HOBSON: What, switch the gravitron off?! <br>
BENOIT: Yes, it's the only chance. <br>
HOBSON: We can't do that, man. The collapse of the gravity would
devastate half the globe. There'd be storms, whirlwinds, hurricanes. <br>
RINBERG [OC]: I overheard your conversation. It's quite out of the
question. You're not to shut down the gravitron under any
circumstances, and that's an order. I think perhaps you don't
appreciate how serious the situation already is. <br>
HOBSON: I bet he gets a knighthood. <br>
RINBERG [OC]: We spent years in a general assembly negotiating methods
of agreement between farmers and landowners and so on. Now the
weather's out of control they're after our blood, and I must say I
can't blame them. You've got to get that thing under control, quickly.
Now please get on with it. <br>
CONTROL [OC]: Earth control, over and out. <br>

certain the rocket is on its way, sent off hours ago. Rinberg's very
