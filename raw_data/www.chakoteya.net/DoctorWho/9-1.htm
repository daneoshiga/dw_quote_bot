tapestries on the wall and long case clock ticking away the decades, a
UNIT soldier stands guard. An efficient middle-aged woman speaks to
him.) <br>

his desk, writing with a proper fountain pen and using a blotter. A
breeze blows the curtains and he goes over to discover a man in
camouflage dress with a non-contemporary weapon.) <br>
STYLES: What the? <br>
(The intruder pushes Styles until he is lying across the back of a
chesterfield.) <br>
STYLES: Ah, no, no! No! <br>
(Just as it seems Styles is about to be shot, there is a strange light
and sound effect, and the intruder vanishes. Miss Paget enters.) <br>
PAGET: Sir Reginald? Are you all right? What happened? <br>
STYLES: He attacked me. Tried to kill me. <br>
PAGET: Who did? What happened? <br>
STYLES: He vanished. Disappeared into thin air, like a ghost. <br>

MINISTER [OC]: Hello? <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, good. Put him through, will you? <br>
MINISTER [OC]: Hello? Hello? <br>
BRIGADIER: Good morning, Minister. <br>
MINISTER [OC]: I've just been on to Auderly House. I've rather had some
rather disturbing news. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes. Yes, I've seen the report from Miss er, Miss Paget. It
doesn't seem to be very much to go on. <br>
MINISTER [OC]: I don't need to tell you how critical the situation is. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, Minister. I'm very well aware of Sir Reginald's
importance in these negotiations. <br>
MINISTER [OC]: Then you're proposing to do nothing about it. <br>
BRIGADIER: No, Minister. I do not propose to ignore the matter. I'm
putting my best man onto it. As a matter of fact, I was just about to
brief him when you rang.

is working on the dematerialisation circuit, as usual.) <br>
JO: Doctor, why don't you take a break? <br>
DOCTOR: It's maddening, you know. So nearly there. If I could only cut
out their override on the dematerialisation circuit. Let me see those
figures. <br>
JO: Doctor? I thought the Tardis was working again. <br>
DOCTOR: What gave you that idea? <br>
JO: Oh, being dragged off to an alien planet five hundred years in the
future, for example. Oh, you know, all that business with the miners
and the colonists. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Jo, the Tardis was being operated then under remote
control by the High Council of the Time Lords. <br>
JO: Well, if it worked for them. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't want it to work for them. I want it to work for me. No
one's going to turn me into an interplanetary puppet. Yes, of course.
Why didn't I think of that before? <br>
(The Doctor goes underneath the console. A moment later the doors to
the lab open and a second Doctor and Jo are standing there.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, of course, I remember now. Look, don't worry, my dear. I
know you're alarmed but you needn't be. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well I think that should do it. Why on Earth I never
realised that. <br>
(Then the Doctor sees himself standing there.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. What are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR 2: Well, I'm not here. Don't worry. Well, that is, in a sense I
am here, but you are not there. Yes, well, it's a bit difficult to
explain really. <br>
DOCTOR: This won't do at all. We can't have two of us running about. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Yes, well don't worry. It will all sort itself <br>
(Flash, bang from the console and the duplicates vanish.) <br>
JO: Doctor? What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a very complicated thing, time, Jo. Once you've
begun tampering with it, the oddest things start happening. <br>
JO: But there was another you and another me. Well, where've they gone?
<br>
DOCTOR: Back into their own time stream, of course. Or do I mean
forward? <br>
JO: But, Doctor, I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, Jo, don't worry about it. It was a freak affect. It's
very unlikely to happen again. Hold that and give me those papers. <br>
(The Brigadier enters.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah, Doctor. Glad you're still here. I need your help. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, Brigadier. I'm busy. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yeah, so am I, Doctor, so am I. Now then, you've heard of
Sir Reginald Styles? <br>
DOCTOR: No, can't say that I have. <br>
JO: Well, isn't he the chief representative at the UN? <br>
BRIGADIER: That's right. Key figure at the latest summit conference. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear chap, I'm a scientist, not a politician. <br>
BRIGADIER: You know, Doctor, if you didn't spend so much time tinkering
around with this wretched contraption, you'd realise just how bad the
international situation's become. <br>
DOCTOR: Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, this particular squabble looks like ending up in
a third world war. The Chinese delegation have refused to attend.
Without them, the conference can't even begin. Now Styles is flying to
Peking in a few hours. There's just a chance that he can persuade them
to change their minds. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, he was working late last night, down at Auderly. <br>
JO: Where's that? <br>
BRIGADIER: Auderly, Miss Grant, is a Government owned country house
about fifty miles north of London where the conference is due to be
held. <br>
JO: Oh. <br>
BRIGADIER: He suddenly started behaving rather oddly. Seemed to think
that someone was trying to assassinate him. <br>
DOCTOR: Any idea who? <br>
BRIGADIER: Some sort of ghost, apparently.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The peace of the lawns near the house is
disturbed by the light and sound effect of the previous night, which
this time deposits a man in the middle of the meadow. He runs for
cover, looks towards the house then flees as a strange sound starts up.
- note, this is Dropmore House in Buckinghamshire, which was almost
destroyed by fires twice in the 1990s. He runs along a path to a
railway bridge over a canal. Suddenly a large grey-skinned alien with
heavy brows and jaw knocks him down the slope. The alien and his
companion walk down the slope, see that the man is unconscious, then go
into a tunnel under the bridge.)

STYLES: Miss Paget. What's going on here? <br>
PAGET: These people are from UNIT, sir. <br>
STYLES: Who asked them to come here? <br>
PAGET: I did, because of what happened yesterday. <br>
STYLES: Nothing happened yesterday. <br>
BRIGADIER: There seems to have been some sort of incident, Sir
Reginald? <br>
STYLES: Nothing of any importance. <br>
JO: Well, if you could tell us what happened? <br>
STYLES: I was working late. I must have dropped off. Freak gust of wind
blew some papers off my desk. I woke up rather confused. I was picking
up the papers when Miss Paget came in. <br>
BRIGADIER: But you did mention ghosts. <br>
STYLES: Did I? Must have been having a nightmare. <br>
PAGET: But the French windows were shut. I closed them before I went to
bed. <br>
STYLES: Then I must have opened them. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you also make those marks on the floor over there? Muddy
feet, Sir Reginald. Someone was in here, you know. <br>
STYLES: Are you accusing me of lying, sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: Sir Reginald, you've obviously been under considerable
strain recently. Were you feeling at all unwell last night? <br>
STYLES: I felt, and feel, perfectly well. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've a lot to do. I'm due at the airport in an hour. <br>
BRIGADIER: You've no objection to my men searching the grounds? <br>
STYLES: None at all. Though I really don't know what you hope to find. </font></p>

combing the grounds thoroughly, and two are looking over the bridge to
the canal. The unconscious man is spotted.) <br>

the man.) <br>
SOLDIER: Sergeant! <br>

(Benton returns with a case on a strap.) <br>
BENTON: Sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: What've you got there, Benton? <br>
BENTON: I've no idea, sir. It was hidden about fifty feet inside the
tunnel. Must have been put there recently, I reckon. <br>

green, with young women sitting at various consoles. The big grey

(The Ogrons speak slowly, with a mouth full of large teeth.
Klingonesque in a way.) <br>
OGRON: We found and destroyed the enemy. <br>
CONTROLLER: Any complications? <br>
OGRON: No complications. <br>
CONTROLLER: Good. They will be satisfied. I did not say dismiss. I want
an intensified effort. There can be no relaxation. Not until we have
found all those responsible for this menace and eliminated them too.

BRIGADIER: It's not a game, sir. It's our duty to protect you. <br>
STYLES: I don't need your protection. <br>
DOCTOR: Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely injured man down
by the canal tunnel. <br>
STYLES: Oh really? And what did he look like? <br>
BRIGADIER: Thirty five-ish, average build. He was wearing a sort of
guerilla combat suit. <br>
DOCTOR: And carrying that gun. <br>
STYLES: I am very sorry, gentlemen, but I have rather more important
things on my mind at the moment. If you'll excuse me. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'll arrange an escort to take you to the airport, sir. <br>
STYLES: Thank you, but it shouldn't be necessary. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, sir, but I think it will. <br>
STYLES: Oh, if you insist. <br>
(Styles leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory and run a few
tests on it. <br>
BRIGADIER: Anything else we can do? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not for the moment. I think we'll just have to sit and wait
and hope that our would-be assassin regains consciousness.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The weapon has been set up in front of a firing
range.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator. <br>
JO: You mean a ray gun? <br>
DOCTOR: That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun. Only it's far more
sophisticated than any weapon yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at
this. <br>
(The Doctor fires the weapon. The target vanishes in a flash of white
light.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quite an effective little weapon, eh? <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, you say this wasn't made on Earth. Do you mean it
comes from another planet? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that was my theory at first, yes, but the metallurgical
analysis shows that the iron constituent is very much of this world. In
fact, it was mined not very far from here. North Wales. <br>
BRIGADIER: How do you explain that? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier? <br>
BRIGADIER: Let's be serious, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I am. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, come along, Doctor, come along. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting the unimaginative nature of
the military mind. But we saw a couple of amicas seperatas a few
moments ago, didn't we, Jo? <br>
JO: Did we? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, here in this laboratory. <br>
JO: Oh, you mean when we <br>
DOCTOR: Mind you, they were manifestations of a much more benevolent
kind. None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers, but ghosts, none
the less. <br>
JO: That was because you were playing around with the time mechanism on
the Tardis, wasn't it? <br>
BRIGADIER: Still can't get it to work, eh? <br>
(The Doctor picks up the case the soldiers found.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can't get this thing to work, either. But this is a
form of time machine, of a very crude kind. <br>
JO: How do you know? <br>
DOCTOR: Come over here. Look at this. Now what do you think that is? <br>
JO: It's a mini-dematerialisation circuit. <br>
DOCTOR: Top of the class, Jo. Now then, pop this in here, like that. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, you heard what Miss Paget said, Jo. We were to treat the
place as our own. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, for your own purposes. <br>

about these criminals, where they operate from, what their plans are,
then the Daleks will destroy both of you. <br>

us whatever we tell you. <br>
CONTROLLER: Not if you cooperate with them. <br>

difference? <br>
CONTROLLER: They can be reasonable. <br>
DOCTOR: Reasonable? They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.
<br>
CONTROLLER: I am a senior government official. <br>
DOCTOR: You sir, you sir, are a traitor! You're a Quisling! <br>
CONTROLLER: Silence! You do not understand. Nobody who did not live
through those terrible years can understand. Towards the end of the
twentieth century, a series of wars broke out. There was a hundred
years of nothing but killing, destruction. Seven eighths of the world's
population was wiped out. The rest were living in holes in the ground,
starving, reduced to the level of animals. <br>
JO: So the Daleks saw their opportunity and took over. <br>
CONTROLLER: There was no power on Earth to stop them. <br>
DOCTOR: So, they've turned the Earth into a giant factory, with all the
wealth and minerals were looted and taken to Skaro. <br>
CONTROLLER: Exactly. Men who were strong enough, of course, were sent
down the mines, the rest work in factories. <br>
JO: Why? Why are they doing all this? <br>
CONTROLLER: They need a constant flow of raw materials. Their empire is
expanding. <br>
JO: How did you come to work for them? <br>
CONTROLLER: They chose a few humans to help them get things going
again, to organise the remaining population. My family have been
controllers in this area for three generations. <br>
DOCTOR: A family of Quisling's, eh? <br>
CONTROLLER: We have helped make things better for the others. We have
gained concessions. I have saved lives! <br>
DOCTOR: Wouldn't you have helped more by organising the fight against
them? <br>
CONTROLLER: No one can fight against the Daleks. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not what your criminal guerillas seem to think, is it. <br>
CONTROLLER: A handful of fanatics. Most of them have been killed
already. I assure you there is nothing they can do to change things.

MONIA: Oh, there are books. Even during the wars, people found time to
study, to write about it. <br>
ANAT: What to you has not yet happened, is to us history. <br>
DOCTOR: This history of yours, it talks about Sir Reginald Styles? <br>
MONIA: Oh yeah. He pretended to be working for peace, but really he
just wanted power for himself. <br>
DOCTOR: So the conference he called was just a trick? <br>
MONIA: He managed to lure the world leaders to a remote country house,
and he pretended they needed absolute quiet if the meeting was to
succeed. But then, there was a devastating explosion. <br>
ANAT: And Styles was killed with the others. He must have set a bomb
and mis-timed the charge. <br>
MONIA: There were accusations, counter-accusations, and then the wars
began. That was the turning point. <br>
JO: But if this true, Sir Reginald Styles must be completely round the
bend. <br>
DOCTOR: So, you went back into our time to kill Styles before he could
carry out his plan. <br>
MONIA: Right. We'd been fighting the Daleks for years, but it was
hopeless. Eventually we must lose, so we thought, what else can we do? <br>
ANAT: We learnt through one of our spies that the Daleks had succeeded
in creating a time machine. We even managed to steal a copy of the
plans, and we built one of our own, so that we could go back into
history to the exact point where things started to go wrong. <br>
MONIA: With one action, we could them. Mankind could have a chance to
take a new direction. <br>
ANAT: But even now, the transfer isn't always stable. People
materialised in your time and then just faded away. <br>
JO: The ghost that Styles saw? <br>
MONIA: Now, somehow the Daleks found what we were doing, and they sent
Ogrons back into your time after us and attacked one of our men. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that must have been the man that we saw down by the canal
tunnel. You remember, Jo, the one who vanished from the ambulance? <br>
ANAT: Yes, we fixed on the tunnel as a place that was stable in your
time and in ours. We used it as a transfer point. Well, you know the
rest. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, there's one thing I don't quite understand and that
is why were you so keen to rescue us? Well believe me, we're grateful,
but <br>
MONIA: Well, you told us yourself. You're an old enemy of the Daleks. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
MONIA: Then you will help us to beat them. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you expect me to do? <br>
MONIA: Well, you can succeed where we've failed, Doctor. We want you to
go back into your own time and kill Styles. <br>

the cordon of steel the Brigadier has thrown up around Auderly House
until he gets to an outbuilding and goes inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're asking me to commit murder! <br>
ANAT: No! We're asking you to kill one man and prevent millions more
dying. <br>
DOCTOR: That is still murder. <br>
MONIA: Isn't it worth it to save the human race from the Daleks? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but would it? <br>
ANAT: We've told you how it happened. <br>
DOCTOR: But your history could be wrong, you know? Now listen, why
don't you send us back to our time? We know the future now. Maybe there
are other things we can do? <br>
ANAT: Monia, we're wasting valuable time. Every minute that goes by <br>
MONIA: Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope. <br>
JO: I still can't believe that Sir Reginald Styles is a ruthless
murderer. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I agree, Jo. Vain to the point of arrogance, a trifle
obstinate, perhaps, but basically a good man. So, if it happened, how
did it happen? Any of your people still in our time zone? <br>
MONIA: No. <br>
ANAT: Oh, Shura. He left just to send a message and we never saw nor
heard from him again. We assumed he must be dead. <br>
(Shura has somehow made his way to the wine cellar under the main house
with the globe device that was hidden by the tunnel in episode two. He
primes the device and starts it up.) <br>

DOCTOR: I'm curious, that's all. <br>

and you're curious. <br>

DOCTOR: Look, please believe me, I'm completely with you about the
ends. I only disagree as to the means. <br>

DOCTOR: This mission of yours to the twentieth century. What did you
take with you? <br>
ANAT: The usual battle gear. Radio, disintegrators. <br>
DOCTOR: Any sabotage equipment? <br>
ANAT: Only a few charges of Dalekanium. <br>
DOCTOR: Dalekanium? <br>
ANAT: It's a highly effective type of explosive. We stole the formula
from the Daleks. <br>
DOCTOR: Could it destroy a house? <br>
MONIA: What are you trying to say, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? This has happened before. <br>
ANAT: What has? <br>
DOCTOR: You went back to change history, but you didn't change
anything. You became a part of it. <br>
MONIA: What are you talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: If Styles didn't cause that explosion, somebody else did. <br>
ANAT: Well, obviously, but who? Shura! <br>
DOCTOR: Isn't that exactly what he would have done? One last suicidal
attempt to carry out his orders? <br>
MONIA: It's possible, I suppose. <br>

explosion and start the wars. You did it yourselves.

what could be described as the most important summit conference of this

indication of the underlying tension of the occasion. A desperate, last
minute attempt to stem the rising tide of international tension that
seems to be moving the great powers towards the brink of a third world
war. Arriving now is Sir Reginald Styles, who with his team of
government aides, has been working around the clock to make this
meeting possible. Sir Reginald himself, has just returned from an
eleventh hour meeting in Peking where his success in persuading the
Chinese leaders to reconsider their walk out gave the first real chance
