[OC]: When I was a child, my favourite story was about a man who lived
forever, but whose eyes were heavy with the weight of all he'd seen. A
man who fell from the stars.

gets the instruction 'Terminate'. So he does.) <br>
MAS: I knew you'd find me eventually. <br>
(Kahler-Mas. Terminate.) <br>
GUNSLINGER: Make peace with your gods. <br>
MAS: Once they were your gods, too. <br>
GUNSLINGER: Not any more. <br>
(The man turns his back and reaches for his space weapon. The
Gunslinger shoots him. We now see that he is a Cyborg with a cybernetic
eye, a gun arm - literally - and a penchant for gunslinger clothes.) <br>
MAN: Am I, am I the last one? <br>
GUNSLINGER: There's one more. The Doctor.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Old West of the USA. The Doctor stands just
outside the entrance to Main Street, in front of a wooden frame with a
cattle skull on it, a Keep Out sign and the residents count recently
changed from 80 to 81.) <br>
DOCTOR: Mercy. Eighty one residents. <br>
(Now we see he is not alone.) <br>
AMY: Look at this. It's a load of stones and lumps of wood. What is it?
<br>
DOCTOR: A load of stones and lumps of wood. <br>
(The Gunslinger is watching from a distance.) <br>
RORY: The sign does say Keep Out. <br>
DOCTOR: I see Keep Out signs as suggestions more than actual orders,
like Dry Clean only. <br>
(They step over the load of stones and lumps of wood that circle the
town and head down the street, towards the Grand Central Bank. The
residents watch silently. An electric street lamp outside the Post
Office sparks.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's not right. <br>
RORY: It's a street lamp. <br>
DOCTOR: An electric street lamp about ten years too early. <br>
RORY: It's only a few years out. <br>
DOCTOR: That's what you said when you left your phone charger in Henry
the Eighth's en-suite. <br>
AMY: Doctor, er <br>
DOCTOR: Anachronistic electricity, Keep Out signs, aggressive stares.
Has someone been peeking at my Christmas list? <br>
AMY: Doctor. <br>

when our trio walk in. The Doctor goes to the bar.) <br>
DOCTOR: Tea. But the strong stuff. Leave the bag in. <br>
SADIE: What're you doing here, son? <br>
DOCTOR: Son? You can stay. <br>
(An African American in a natty black suit speaks.) <br>
PREACHER: Sir, might I enquire who you is? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. I'm the Doctor. This is <br>
(Everyone stands up.) <br>
DOCTOR: No need to stand. You see that? Manners. Oh, thank you. <br>
(A man in a top hat starts measuring the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: But I don't need a new suit. <br>
ABRAHAM: I'm the undertaker, sir. <br>
(A younger man in a brown suit and bowler hat steps forward. I'm
guessing at the
character name. It might be Dockery instead.) <br>
WALTER: I got a question. Is you an alien? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, er, bit personal. It's all relative, isn't it? I mean, I
think you're the aliens, but in this context, yes. Yes, I suppose I am.

high.) <br>
DOCTOR: Guys! <br>

AMY: Doctor! Put him down! <br>
SADIE: Don't think we won't kill you. <br>
RORY: Leave him alone! <br>
DOCTOR: Rory, everything is completely under control. Guys, guys, guys.
<br>
(They throw the Doctor out of town. Literally.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow. <br>
(When he turns around, they all point their revolvers at him. The
Gunslinger suddenly appears in the distance.) <br>
PREACHER: He's coming. Oh God, he's coming. <br>
WALTER: Preacher, say something. <br>
PREACHER: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. <br>
(The Doctor turns around to see the Cyborg approaching by dimension
jumps. He is scared.) <br>
PREACHER: Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. <br>
(A mustachioed man fires a shot in the air. Ben Browder, everyone.) <br>
ISAAC: You, bow tie. Get back across that line. <br>
(He pulls back his coat to reveal a six pointed metal star with the
word Marshal
on it.) <br>
ISAAC: Now. <br>
(The Doctor steps over the rocks and wood, and the Cyborg stops then
vanishes.) <br>
WALTER: Isaac, he said he was a doctor. An alien doctor. <br>
ISAAC: That a reason to hand him to his death? <br>
WALTER: Isaac, it could be him. <br>
ISAAC: You know it ain't. <br>
(Isaac walks back down the street, nodding to Amy.) <br>
ISAAC: Ma'am. <br>
WALTER: Just letting him go like that? Be seeing you, boy.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Marshal's Office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: What was that outside? <br>
ISAAC: The Gunslinger. Showed up three weeks back. We've been prisoners
ever since. See that border line stretching round the town? Woke up one
morning, there it was. Nothing gets past it, in or out. No supply
wagons, no reinforcements. Pretty soon the whole town's going to starve
to death. <br>
RORY: But you let us in. <br>
ISAAC: You ain't carrying any food. Just three more mouths to feed.
We'll all die even sooner now. <br>
DOCTOR: What happens if someone crosses the line? <br>
(Isaac throws the Doctor a Stetson with a neat hole in it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, he wasn't a very good shot, then. <br>
ISAAC: He was aiming for the hat. <br>
DOCTOR: He shoots people's hats? <br>
AMY: It was a warning shot. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, no, yes. I see. Hmm. <br>
AMY: What does he want? Has he issued some kind of demand? <br>
ISAAC: Says he wants us to give him the alien doctor. <br>
AMY: But that's you. Why would he want to kill you? Unless he's met
you. <br>
RORY: And how could he know that we'd be here? (sotto) We didn't even
know we'd be here. <br>
AMY: We were aiming for Mexico. The Doctor was taking us to see the Day
of the Dead Festival. <br>
ISAAC: Mexico's two hundred miles due south. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's what happens when people get toast crumbs on the
console. Anyway, I think it's about time I met him, don't you? <br>
ISAAC: Who? <br>
DOCTOR: The chap outside said I could be the alien doctor, but you said
I wasn't, so you already know who it is. Two alien doctors. We're like
buses. Resident eighty one, I presume, so beloved by the townsfolk he
warranted an alteration to the sign. Probably because he rigged up
these electrics, and I'm guessing he's in here, because if half the
town suddenly wanted to throw me to my death, this is where I'd want to
be. <br>
ISAAC: I don't know what you <br>
(The man in the cell throws back his blanket. He has a curved mark down
the left
side of his face, similar but not the same as Mas had.) <br>
JEX: Isaac, I think the time for subterfuge has passed. Good afternoon.
My name is Kahler-Jex. I'm the doctor. <br>
(The Gunslinger watches the town from a distant ridge.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Kahler. I love the Kahler. They're one of the most
ingenious races in the galaxy. Seriously, they could build a spaceship
out of
Tupperware and moss. <br>
AMY: All right. How did you get here? <br>
JEX: My craft crashed about a mile or so out of town. I would have died
if Isaac and the others hadn't pulled me from the wreckage. <br>
DOCTOR: And you stayed, as their doctor. <br>
JEX: On my world I was a surgeon, so it seemed logical. And it gave me
an opportunity to repay my debt to them. <br>
ISAAC: Listen to him. Talking like it was nothing. Tell them about the
cholera. <br>
JEX: Now, Isaac, I'm sure our guests are <br>
ISAAC: Two years after he arrived, there was an outbreak of cholera.
Thanks to the doc here, not a single person died. <br>
JEX: A minor infection we'd found a treatment for centuries ago. <br>
ISAAC: No, no, what, what do you call them? The electrics? <br>
JEX: Using my ship as a generator, I was able to rig up some
rudimentary heating and lighting for the town. <br>
DOCTOR: So why does the Gunslinger want you? <br>
ISAAC: It don't matter. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm just saying, if we knew that <br>
ISAAC: America's the land of second chances. We called this town Mercy
for a reason. Others, some round here, don't feel that way. <br>
JEX: Now, Isaac, we've discussed this. <br>
ISAAC: People whose lives you've saved are suddenly saying we should
hand you over. <br>
JEX: They're scared, that's all. You can hardly blame them. <br>
ISAAC: Them being scared scares me. War only ended five years back.
That old violence is still under the surface. We give up Doc Jex, then
we hand the keys of the town over to chaos. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you try to repair your craft? Surely someone with your
skills <br>
JEX: It really was very badly damaged. <br>
DOCTOR: We evacuate the town. Our ship's just over the hills, room for
everyone. I'll pop out, bring it back here, Robert's your uncle. <br>
AMY: Really? Simple as that. No crazy schemes, no negotiations. <br>
DOCTOR: I've matured. I'm twelve hundred years old now. Plus I don't
want to miss The Archers. <br>
AMY: Oh, so you're not even a tiny bit curious? <br>
DOCTOR: Why would I be curious? It's a mysterious space cowboy
assassin. Curious? Of course I'm not curious. <br>
ISAAC: Son? You've still got to get past the Gunslinger. How you going
to do that? <br>
(The Doctor puts on the Stetson.) <br>
DOCTOR: With a little sleight of hand.

ISAAC: You okay? <br>
RORY: I'm fine, yes. <br>
ISAAC: Keep moving. Next time, you get to wear Jex's clothes. <br>
(The Gunslinger spots them, but his computer tells him there is an 87%
chance of injury to innocent, disengage, so he does.)

official Marshal business. <br>
PREACHER: He's called Joshua. It's from the Bible. It means the
Deliverer. <br>
DOCTOR: No, he isn't. I speak horse. He's called Susan, and he wants
you to respect his life choices. <br>

you home? <br>
JEX: Thank you, but I've already given everything I have to the Kahler.
My skills, energy, all that was good in me. Here, I could start afresh.
I could remember myself and help people. That's all I ever wanted to
do, end suffering. <br>
AMY: Here. <br>
(She puts Isaac's coat over Jex's shoulders.) <br>
JEX: You're a mother, aren't you. <br>
AMY: How did you know? <br>
JEX: There's kindness in your eyes. And sadness, but a ferocity too. <br>
AMY: Life's not exactly straight forward. <br>
JEX: It seldom is. <br>
AMY: And what about you? Are you a father? <br>
JEX: Yes. In a way, I suppose I am. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ISAAC: So, we're waiting till the Doctor comes to
pick us up in your ship. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is galloping down the road when he
slows up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes, I know we're in a hurry. I
just want to check something out. Two ticks. <br>
(He dismounts.) <br>
DOCTOR: There's something niggling me. Yes, yes, it could be important.
Oi, don't swear. <br>
(He rummages in the dust and finds the shiny power cable that connects
Jex's ship to the town. Jex notices the light in the office flickering.
The Doctor rides on until he reaches the source of the power covered in
a tarpaulin.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes, I wear a Stetson now. <br>
(The Doctor uncovers the gleaming white egg-shaped object.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, a good point, Susan. Where is the damage? <br>
(The Gunslinger stands on the ridge above Isaac and Rory. Target
located. Terminate. Meanwhile, the Doctor is trying to get into Jex's
ship. His sonic screwdriver sets off an alarm then a hatch opens. The
Gunslinger hears it. Kahler
Alarm Detected. It powers down its gun and goes to investigate.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The alarm can even be heard in town.) <br>
JEX: That's the alarm on my ship. <br>
AMY: Maybe the Doctor wants to get it working again? <br>
JEX: But that wasn't the plan. He's not following the plan. <br>

around.) <br>

DOCTOR: This is an awful lot of security for a titchy spacecraft. <br>

COMPUTER: File not found. Please choose from Technical Specifications,
Flight Recorder, Personal Files, Maps and Charts. <br>

briefly then out again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot. I know who you are, and
who Jex is, too. <br>
(The Gunslinger powers down his weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, what I don't understand is why you haven't just walked
into town and killed him. <br>
GUNSLINGER: People will get in the way. <br>
DOCTOR: You want justice, you deserve justice, but this isn't the way.
We can put him on trial <br>
GUNSLINGER: When he starts killing your people, you can use your
justice.

things may have been uncovered that even he might struggle to forgive,
so it's best we beat a hasty retreat. <br>
AMY: We? I'm coming with you? <br>
JEX: It's unlikely the Gunslinger will shoot if I'm with you. As far as
I can tell, he's programmed to take innocent lives only if absolutely
necessary. <br>
AMY: Oh, well, colour me reassured. <br>

just thought I'd put you all in enough danger. Perhaps if I left <br>

DOCTOR: He's lying. Every word, every thing he says, it's all lies.
This man is a murderer. <br>
JEX: I am a scientist. <br>
DOCTOR: Sit down. Sit down! Tell them what you are. <br>
JEX: What am I? A war hero. <br>
ISAAC: Okay, somebody want to tell me what is going on? <br>
DOCTOR: The Gunslinger is a Cyborg. <br>
ISAAC: A what? <br>
DOCTOR: Half man, half machine. A weapon. Jex built it. He and his team
took volunteers, told them they'd been selected for special training,
then experimented on them, fused their bodies with weaponry, and
programmed them to kill. <br>
ISAAC: Okay. Why? Why would you do that, Doc? <br>
JEX: We'd been at war for nine years. A war that had already decimated
half of our planet. Our task was to bring peace, and we did. We built
an army that routed the enemy and ended the war in less than a week. Do
you want me to repent, to beg forgiveness for saving millions of lives?
<br>
DOCTOR: And how many died screaming on the operating table before you
had found your advantage? <br>
JEX: War is another world. You cannot apply the politics of peace to
what I did. To what any of us did. <br>
RORY: What happened then? How come you're here? <br>
JEX: When the war ended we had the Cyborgs decommissioned, but one of
them must have got its circuitry damaged in battle. It went offline and
began hunting down the team that created it until just two of us were
left. We fled, and our ships crashed here. <br>
RORY: So, what do we do with Jex? <br>
ISAAC: What do we do with him? <br>
RORY: Yeah. I mean, he's a war criminal. <br>
ISAAC: No, he's the guy that saved the town from cholera, the guy that
gave us heat and light. <br>
AMY: Look, Jex may be a criminal and yeah, kind of creepy <br>
JEX: And still in the room. <br>
AMY: But I think we should put aside what he did and find another
solution. <br>
RORY: Another solution? It's him or us. <br>
AMY: When did we start letting people get executed? Did I miss a memo?
Doctor, tell him. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes. I don't know. Whatever Amy said. <br>
JEX: Looking at you, Doctor, is like looking into a mirror, almost.
There's rage there, like me. Guilt, like me. Solitude. Everything but
the nerve to do what needs to be done. Thank the gods my people weren't
relying on you to save them. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, but these people are. Out! Out! Out! <br>
(Rory stops Amy at the door.) <br>
AMY: Oh, you're really letting him do this? <br>
RORY: Save us all? Yeah, I really am.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JEX: No! <br>
(The Doctor pushes Jex along the street.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go on. <br>
(The townsfolk follow Isaac to see the Doctor push Jex over the
boundary.) <br>
DOCTOR: Get over, and don't come back. <br>
(The Doctor takes a gun from a man's holster and points it at Jex as he
tries to return.) <br>
JEX: You wouldn't. <br>
DOCTOR: I genuinely don't know. <br>
ISAAC: Doctor. Doctor. <br>
(Amy gets another gun and fires in the air.) <br>
AMY: Let him come back, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Or what? You won't shoot me, Amy. <br>
AMY: How do you know? Maybe I've changed. I mean, you've clearly been
taking stupid lessons since I saw you last. <br>
(Her gun fires again.) <br>
AMY: I didn't mean to do that. <br>
(So Isaac fires to get everyone's attention.) <br>
ISAAC: Everyone who isn't an American, drop your gun. <br>
DOCTOR: We can end this right now. We could save everyone right now. <br>
AMY: This is not how we roll, and you know it. What happened to you,
Doctor? When did killing someone become an option? <br>
DOCTOR: Jex has to answer for his crimes. <br>
AMY: And what then? Are you going to hunt down everyone who's made a
gun or a bullet or a bomb? <br>
DOCTOR: But they coming back, don't you see? Every time I negotiate, I
try to understand. Well, not today. No. Today, I honour the victims
first. His, the Master's, the Dalek's, all the people who died because
of my mercy! <br>
AMY: You see, this is what happens when you travel alone for too long.
Well, listen to me, Doctor. We can't be like him. We have to be better
than him. <br>
DOCTOR: Amelia Pond. Fine, fine. We think of something else. But
frankly, I'm betting on the Gunslinger. <br>
(The Doctor gives his gun back and holds out his hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jex, move over the line. Now. <br>
(Because the Gunslinger is right behind him. Jex turns around.) <br>
GUNSLINGER: Make peace with your gods. <br>
JEX: Kahler-Tek, isn't it? I remember all your names, even now. I'll
never hurt anyone again. I'm even helping people here. <br>
GUNSLINGER: Last chance. Make peace with your gods. <br>
ISAAC: No! <br>
(Isaac pushes Jex out of the way and takes the Gunslinger's shot
instead.) <br>
DOCTOR: Isaac. Isaac. Isaac. It's okay, it's okay. We can get you to
Jex's surgery. He can save you. <br>
(Life Signs Deteriorating.) <br>
ISAAC: Listen to me. You've got to stay. You've got to look after
everyone. <br>
DOCTOR: It won't come to that, Isaac. <br>
ISAAC: Protect Jex. Protect my town. You're both good men. You just
forget it sometimes. <br>
(Isaac dies, handing on his Marshal's badge. The Doctor stands up and
pins it on his jacket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Take Jex to his cell. If anything happens to him, you'll have
me to answer to. <br>
(Jex is escorted away. The Doctor speaks to the Gunslinger.) <br>
DOCTOR: This has gone on long enough. <br>
GUNSLINGER: You are right. You've got until noon tomorrow. Give him to
me or I'll kill you all. <br>

SADIE: What it wants is to kill our friend. <br>
WALTER: We don't got any ill feeling towards the Doc. We just thinking
about our families. Hand him over and we all safe again. <br>
DOCTOR: You know I can't do that. <br>
WALTER: We got us a problem. <br>
DOCTOR: Please don't do this. <br>
WALTER: Why, reckon you're quicker than me? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, certainly not, but this? Lynch mobs? A town turning against
itself? This is everything Isaac didn't want. <br>
(Walter draws his gun and cocks it.) <br>
DOCTOR: How old are you? <br>
WALTER: Nearly nineteen. <br>
(The Doctor is slowly walking forward.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's eighteen, then. Too young to have fought in the war, so
I'm guessing you've never shot anyone before, have you? <br>
WALTER: First time for everything. <br>
DOCTOR: But that's how all this started. Jex turned someone into a
weapon. Now that same story's going to make you a killer, too. Don't
you see? Violence doesn't end violence, it extends it, and I don't
think you want to do this. I don't think you want to become that man. <br>
WALTER: There's kids here. <br>
DOCTOR: I know, who I can save if you'll let me. <br>
WALTER: He really worth the risk? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't know. But you are. <br>
(Walter lowers his gun and walks away. The crowd disperses.) <br>
DOCTOR: Frightened people. Give me a Dalek any day.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor removes the gun belt.) <br>
ABRAHAM: Fresh coffee, Marshal. For what it's worth, I know you're
going to save us. Isaac made you Marshal for a reason, and if you're
good enough for him, you're good enough for me. Reckon you should know
that. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(Abraham continues to take his measurements.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oi. Get out of it. <br>
(Abraham leaves.) <br>
JEX: Let me guess. The good folk of Mercy wanted me to take a little
stroll into the desert. You could turn a blind eye. No one would blame
you. You'd be a hero. <br>
DOCTOR: But I can't, can I. Because then Isaac's death would mean
nothing. Just another casualty in your endless bloody war. Do you want
me to hand you over? Is that what you want? Do you even know? <br>
JEX: You think I'm unaffected by what I did? That I don't hear them
screaming every time I close my eyes? It would be so much simpler if I
was just one thing, wouldn't it? The mad scientist who made that
killing machine, or the physician who's dedicated his life to serving
this town. The fact that I'm both bewilders you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I know exactly what you are, and I see this reformation for
what it really is. You committed an atrocity and chose this as your
punishment. Don't get me wrong, good choice. Civilised hours, lots of
adulation, nice weather, but, but justice doesn't work like that. You
don't get to decide when and how your debt is paid. <br>
JEX: In my culture, we believe that when you die your spirit has to
climb a mountain carrying the souls of everyone you wronged in your
lifetime. Imagine the weight I will have to lift. The monsters I
created, the people they killed. Isaac, he was my friend. Now his soul
will be in my arms, too. Can you see now why I fear death? You want to
hand me over. There's no shame in that. But you won't. We all carry our
prisons with us. Mine is my past. Yours is your morality. <br>
DOCTOR: We all carry our prisons with us. Ha!

(Inside the Marshal's office, Amy and Jex hear the whoosh of the
Gunslinger dimension-shifting towards town. The clock strikes 12 as he
steps across the barrier. When it finishes striking, the Gunslinger
raises his weapon. The Doctor brandishes the sonic screwdriver,
disrupting his systems and ruining his aim. Several windows and the
Bank clock suffer as the Doctor runs away.)

Gunslinger is standing guard over the town.) <br>
WOMAN [OC]: By the time the Gunslinger arrived, the people of Mercy
were used to the strange, the impossible. Where he came from didn't
matter. As a man once said, America is a land of second chances. Do I
believe the story? I don't know. My great-grandmother must have been a
little girl when he arrived. But next time you're in Mercy, ask someone
why they don't have a Marshal or Sheriff or policeman there. We've got
our own arrangement, they'll say, then they'll smile like they got a
secret. Like they've got their own special angel watching out for them.
Their very own angel who fell from the stars. </font> </p>
