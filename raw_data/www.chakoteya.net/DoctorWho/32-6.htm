G-DOCTOR: Argh. What's happening? I wonder if we'll get back. Yes, one
day. Argh. I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. <br>
DOCTOR: The Flesh is struggling to cope with our past regenerations.
Hold on. <br>
DOCTOR 4 [OC]: Would you like a jelly baby? <br>
G-DOCTOR: Why? Why? Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Why what? <br>
G-DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. No, let it go, we've moved on. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on, you can stabilise. <br>
G-DOCTOR: I've reversed the jelly baby of the neutron flow. Would you
like a Doctor, Doctor, I'm, I'm the. I can't. <br>
DOCTOR: No, listen, hold on. Hold on. <br>
G-DOCTOR: No! Argh. <br>
(The other Gangers are trying to batter their way in. Then it all goes
quiet.) <br>
BUZZER: I think I liked it best when they were being noisy. <br>
AMY: Mmm hmm. Doctor, we need you. Get over here. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
AMY: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Cybermats. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Do we have time for this? <br>
DOCTOR: We make time. I'd like more proof that you're me. Cybermats. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Created by the Cybermen. They kill by feeding off brainwaves.
<br>
AMY: Are you sure there aren't any weapons to can get to, like big guns
with bits on? <br>
BUZZER: Yeah, big guns would be good right now. <br>
JIMMY: Why would we have guns? We're a factory. We mine. <br>
AMY: Acid. <br>
(The door starts to dissolve and the Gangers recommence their
battering.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rory and Amy, they may not trust both of us. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Are you thinking what I'm thinking? <br>
DOCTOR: Inevitably. <br>
G-DOCTOR: I'm glad we're on the same <br>
DOCTOR: Wavelength. You see, great minds. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Exactly. So, what's the plan? <br>
DOCTOR: Save them all, humans and gangers. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Tall order. Sounds wonderful. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that what you were thinking? It's just so inspiring to hear
me say it. <br>
G-DOCTOR: I know. <br>
AMY: Doctor, come on. <br>
G-DOCTOR: So, what now, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, time to get cracking, Doctor. <br>
BOTH: Hello. Sorry, but we had to establish a few ground rules. <br>
DOCTOR: Formulate a protocol. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Protocol? Very posh. <br>
DOCTOR: A protocol between us. Otherwise <br>
G-DOCTOR: It gets horribly embarrassing. <br>
DOCTOR: And potentially confusing. <br>
AMY: I'm glad you've solved the problem of confusing. <br>
G-DOCTOR: That's sarcasm. <br>
DOCTOR: She's very good at sarcasm. <br>
BOTH: Breathe. <br>
AMY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: We have to get you off this island. And the Gangers too. <br>
CLEAVES: Sorry, would you like a memo from the last meeting? They are
trying to kill us! <br>
DOCTOR: They're scared. <br>
AMY: Doctor, we're trapped in here. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, See, I don't think so. The Flesh Bowl is fed by cabling
from above. <br>
G-DOCTOR: But where are the earthing conduits? <br>
DOCTOR: All this piping must go down into a tunnel or a shaft or
something, yes? With us? <br>
(He finds a grating in the wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yowza. An escape route. <br>
AMY: Yowza? <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I'm starting to get a sense of just how impressive it
is to hang out with me. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Do we tend to say yowza? <br>
DOCTOR: That's enough, let it go, okay? We're under stress. <br>
(When the armoured Gangers break in, the Doctor is sonicking the
grating shut again. The two Cleaves stare at each other briefly.)

a maze. I bet you lot have got a computer map, haven't you? <br>
CLEAVES: If we can get power running, we can scan for them. Be a lot
quicker. <br>

G-JIMMY: They could be anywhere. How are we going to find them? <br>
G-CLEAVES: Think about it. With all that gas out there, my guess would
be the evac tower. Get above it, try to get power up. <br>
G-JIMMY: So? Let's stop them. <br>
G-CLEAVES: It's a narrow doorway. I could defend it easy enough. So can

Out of bed at the crack of dawn. It's funny, he's got this wee dance he
does when he gets over-excited. <br>
G-JENNIFER: Listen to me. I tried to block the memories, but now I know
I must remember. It's the eyes. The eyes are the last to go. <br>
G-JIMMY: What are you talking about? <br>
G-JENNIFER: When they destroy us, the eyes are the last things to melt.
And there's one question in those eyes. Why? Why should we suffer for
the sake of human beings? <br>
G-DICKEN: I heard in India there's over ten million Gangers. <br>
G-JENNIFER: We can reach out. Inspire them to rise up. <br>
G-CLEAVES: Revolution? Look, I just, I just want to be left to live in
peace, Jen. <br>
G-JENNIFER: They will melt you. Have you become so human that you've
forgotten the truth? Don't you remember all the times you were
decommissioned, or should I say executed? <br>
G-CLEAVES: No, we don't remember. <br>
G-JENNIFER: Well, I do. It's us or them. <br>
G-JIMMY: She's right. <br>
G-JENNIFER: I have a plan, and it'll destroy them all.

the console. I think the Ganger is on our left and the original on our
right, but I could be wrong.) <br>
CLEAVES: Can you really get the power back? <br>
G-DOCTOR: Oh, there's always some power floating around. <br>
DOCTOR: Sticking to the wires, like bits of lint. <br>
AMY: Can you stop finishing each other's <br>
DOCTOR: Sentences? No probs. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
AMY: No, hang on. You said that the Tardis was stuck in acid, so won't
she be damaged? <br>
DOCTOR: Nah, she's a tough old thing. Tough, old, sexy. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Tough, dependable, sexy. <br>
AMY: Come on. Okay, how can how can you both be real? <br>
G-DOCTOR: Well, because we are. I'm the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah and so am I. We both contain the knowledge of over nine
hundred years of memory and experience. <br>
DOCTOR: We both wear the same bow tie, which is cool. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Because bow ties are <br>
DOCTOR: And always will be. <br>
AMY: But how did the Flesh read you? Because you weren't linked up to
the it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it must've been after I examined it. Thus, a new, genuine
Doctor was created. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Ta-da. <br>
AMY: No getting away from it. One of you was here first. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, okay. After the Flesh scanned me, I had an accident with
a puddle of acid. Now, new shoes. A situation which did not confront me
learned self here. <br>
G-DOCTOR: That satisfy you, Pond? <br>
AMY: Don't call me Pond, please. What? <br>
G-DOCTOR: Interesting. You definitely feel more affection for him than
me. <br>
AMY: No, no, I. Look, you're fine and everything, but he's the Doctor.
No offence. Being almost the Doctor is pretty damn impressive. <br>
G-DOCTOR: Being almost the Doctor's like being no Doctor at all. <br>
AMY: Don't overreact. <br>
G-DOCTOR: You might as well call me Smith. <br>
AMY: Smith? <br>
G-DOCTOR: John Smith. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! Communication a go-go. <br>

AMY: Find Rory! Show me the scanning tracking screen. Come on, Rory,
