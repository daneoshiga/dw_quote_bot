</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Up. Look up. <br>
(Everyone struggles to their feet on an artificial surface, although
the tunnel walls are the same.) <br>
RIVER: Are you okay? <br>
AMY: What happened? <br>
RIVER: We jumped. <br>
AMY: Jumped where? <br>
DOCTOR: Up. Up. Look up. <br>
AMY: Where are we? <br>
RIVER: Exactly where we were. <br>
AMY: No we're not. <br>
DOCTOR: Move your feet. <br>
(The Doctor sonicks a circular hatch in the floor, with six inset
lights around it.) <br>
AMY: Doctor, what am I looking at? Explain. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Amy, think. The ship crashed with the power still
on, yeah? So what else is still on? <br>
(The camera moves out and rotates through 180 degrees. Our gallant
heroes are standing upside down on the hull of the Byzantium.) <br>
DOCTOR: The artificial gravity. One good jump, and up we fell. Shot out
the grav globe to give us an updraft, and here we are. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Doctor, the statues. They look more like Angels now. <br>
DOCTOR: They're feeding on the radiation from the wreckage, draining
all the power from the ship, restoring themselves. Within an hour,
they'll be an army. <br>
(The circular hatch opens. A light goes bang.) <br>
DOCTOR: They're taking out the lights. Look at them. Look at the
Angels. Into the ship, now. Quickly, all of you. <br>
AMY: How? <br>
(The Doctor drops through the open hatch into a circular corridor. From
Amy's point of view, he is standing on the side of a vertical tube.) <br>
AMY: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: It's just a corridor. The gravity orientates to the floor. Now,
in here, all of you. Don't take your eyes off the Angels. Move, move,
move. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OCTAVIAN [OC]: Okay, men. Go, go, go! <br>
(The Doctor works on a control panel.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: The Angels. Presumably they can jump up too? <br>
(The hatch closes.) <br>
DOCTOR: They're here, now. In the dark, we're finished. <br>
(A bulkhead further along the corridor starts to close.) <br>
DOCTOR: Run! <br>
OCTAVIAN: This whole place is a death trap. <br>
(They don't make it.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's a time bomb. Well, it's a death trap and a time bomb.
And now it's a dead end. Nobody panic. Oh, just me then. What's through
here? <br>
RIVER: Secondary flight deck. <br>
AMY: Okay. so we've basically run up the inside of a chimney, yeah? So
what if the gravity fails? <br>
DOCTOR: I've thought about that. <br>
AMY: And? <br>
DOCTOR: And we'll all plunge to our deaths. See? I've thought about it.
The security protocols are still live. There's no way to override them.
It's impossible. <br>
(River is working.) <br>
RIVER: How impossible? <br>
DOCTOR: Two minutes. <br>
(The outer hatch is open.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: The hull is breached and the power's failing. <br>
(The lights go out. An arm is silhouetted against the open hatch.) <br>
MARCO: Sir, incoming. <br>
AMY: Doctor? Lights. <br>
(The Angel is starting to enter. Another flicker, and four are inside
and the hatch is closed behind them.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: Clerics, keep watching them. <br>
DOCTOR: And don't look at their eyes. Anywhere else. Not the eyes. I've
isolated the lighting grid. They can't drain the power now. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Good work, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Good, good, good. Good in many ways. Good you like it so
far. <br>
AMY: So far? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's only one way to open this door. I guess I'll need
to route all the power in this section through the door control. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Good. Fine. Do it. <br>
DOCTOR: Including the lights. All of them. I'll need to turn out the
lights. <br>
OCTAVIAN: How long for? <br>
DOCTOR: Fraction of a second. Maybe longer. Maybe quite a bit longer. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Maybe? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm guessing. We're being attacked by statues in a crashed
ship. There isn't a manual for this. <br>
AMY: Doctor, we lost the torches. We'll be in total darkness. <br>
DOCTOR: No other way. Bishop. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Doctor Song, I've lost good Clerics today. You trust this
man? <br>
RIVER: I absolutely trust him. <br>
OCTAVIAN: He's not some kind of madman, then? <br>
RIVER: I absolutely trust him. <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. <br>
OCTAVIAN: (sotto) I'm taking your word, because you're the only one who
can manage this guy. But that only works so long as he doesn't know who
you are. You cost me any more men, and I might just tell him.
Understood? <br>
RIVER: Understood. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Okay, Doctor. We've got your back. <br>
DOCTOR: Bless you. Bishop. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Combat distance, ten feet. As soon as the lights go down,
continuous fire. Full spread over the hostiles. Do not stop firing
while the lights are out. Shot gun protocol. We don't have bullets to
waste. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, when the lights go down, the wheel should release. Spin it
clockwise four turns. <br>
AMY: Ten. <br>
DOCTOR: No, four. Four turns. <br>
AMY: Yeah, four. I heard you. <br>
DOCTOR: Ready! <br>
(He plunges his sonic screwdriver into a control unit.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: On my count, then. God be with us all. Three, two, one, fire!
<br>
(The lights go out, the Clerics start shooting at the approaching
Angels.) <br>
DOCTOR: Turn! <br>
AMY: Doctor, it's opening. It's working. <br>
(They get the bulkhead open just enough to squeeze through.) <br>
DOCTOR: Fall back! <br>
(The Doctor is last through the bulkhead. It clangs shut again. They
run along a short corridor and into)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Secondary Flight Deck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIVER: Doctor, quickly. <br>
AMY: Doctor! <br>
(The Doctor dodges inside at the last second, as the door closes, and
runs to the controls. The Angels thump on the door and the wheel starts
turning.) <br>
AMY: Doctor! What are you doing? <br>
(Octavian has placed a device on the door. The wheel stops turning.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: Magnetized the door. Nothing could turn that wheel now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah? <br>
(The wheel turns.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: Dear God! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, now you're getting it. You've bought us time though. That's
good. I am good with time. <br>
AMY: Doctor. <br>
(The wheel on a second door to the right of the main one starts to
turn.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: Seal that door. Seal it now. <br>
(Marco obeys.) <br>
RIVER: We're surrounded. <br>
(And now the door to the left.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: Seal it. Seal that door. Doctor, how long have we got? <br>
DOCTOR: Five minutes, max. <br>
AMY: Nine. <br>
DOCTOR: Five. <br>
AMY: Five. Right. Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Why'd you say nine? <br>
AMY: I didn't. <br>
RIVER: We need another way out of here. <br>
OCTAVIAN: There isn't one. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, there is. Course there is. This is a galaxy class ship.
Goes for years between planet falls. So, what do they need? <br>
RIVER: Of course. <br>
AMY: Of course what? What do they need? <br>
OCTAVIAN: Can we get in there? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a sealed unit, but they must have installed it
somehow. This whole wall should slide up. There's clamps. Release the
clamps. <br>
AMY: What's through there? What do they need? <br>
RIVER: They need to breathe. <br>
(The rear wall of the flight deck slides up to reveal -) <br>
AMY: But that's. That's a. <br>
RIVER: It's an oxygen factory. <br>
AMY: It's a forest. <br>
RIVER: Yeah, it's a forest. It's an oxygen factory. <br>
DOCTOR: And if we're lucky, an escape route. <br>
AMY: Eight. <br>
RIVER: What did you say? <br>
AMY: Nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Is there another exit? Scan the architecture, we don't have
time to get lost in there. <br>
OCTAVIAN: On it. Stay where you are until I've checked the Rad levels. <br>
AMY: But trees, on a space ship? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, more than trees. Way better than trees. You're going to
love this. Treeborgs. Trees plus technology. Branches become cables
become sensors on the hull. A forest sucking in starlight, breathing
out air. It even rains. There's a whole mini-climate. This vault is an
ecopod running right through the heart of the ship. A forest in a
bottle on a space ship in a maze. Have I impressed you yet, Amy Pond? <br>
AMY: Seven. <br>
DOCTOR: Seven? <br>
AMY: Sorry, what? <br>
DOCTOR: You said seven. <br>
AMY: No. I didn't. <br>
RIVER: Yes. you did. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Doctor, there's an exit, far end of the ship, into the
Primary Flight Deck. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good. That's where we need to go. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Plotting a safe path now. <br>
DOCTOR: Quick as you like. <br>
BOB [OC]: Doctor? Excuse me? Hello, Doctor? Angel Bob here, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. There you are, Angel Bob. How's life? Sorry, bad subject. <br>
BOB [OC]: The Angels are wondering what you hope to achieve. <br>
DOCTOR: Achieve? We're not achieving anything. We're just hanging. It's
nice in here. Consoles, comfy chairs, a forest. How's things with you? <br>
BOB [OC]: The Angels are feasting, sir. Soon we will be able to absorb
enough power to consume this vessel, this world. and all the stars and
worlds beyond. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we've got comfy chairs. Did I mention? <br>
BOB [OC]: We have no need of comfy chairs. <br>
DOCTOR: I made him say comfy chairs. <br>
AMY: Six. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, Bob, enough chat. Here's what I want to know. What have
you done to Amy? <br>
BOB [OC]: There is something in her eye. <br>
DOCTOR: What's in her eye? <br>
BOB [OC]: We are. <br>
AMY: What's he talking about? Doctor, I'm five. I mean, five. Fine! I'm
fine. <br>
RIVER: You're counting. <br>
AMY: Counting? <br>
DOCTOR; You're counting down from ten. You have been for a couple of
minutes. <br>
AMY: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
AMY: Well, counting down to what? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
BOB [OC]: We shall take her. We shall take all of you. We shall have
dominion over all time and space. <br>
DOCTOR: Get a life, Bob. Oops, sorry again. There's power on this ship,
but nowhere near that much. <br>
BOB [OC]: With respect, sir, there's more power on this ship than you
yet understand. <br>
(There is a screeching sound.) <br>
RIVER: What's that? Dear God, what is it? <br>
OCTAVIAN: They're back. <br>
BOB [OC]: It's hard to put in your terms, Doctor Song, but as best I
understand it, the Angels are laughing. <br>
DOCTOR: Laughing? <br>
BOB [OC]: Because you haven't noticed yet, sir. The Doctor in the
Tardis hasn't noticed. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Wait. There's something I've missed. <br>
(A steaming W crack in the bulkhead above the entrance, and it is
widening.) <br>
AMY: That's, that's, that's like the crack from my bedroom wall from
when I was a little girl. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Two parts of space and time that should never have
touched. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Okay, enough. We're moving out. <br>
RIVER: Agreed. Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, fine. <br>
RIVER: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Right with you. <br>
(He scans the crack.) <br>
RIVER: We're not leaving without you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, you are. Bishop? <br>
OCTAVIAN: Miss Pond, Doctor Song, now! <br>
AMY: Doctor? <br>
RIVER: Come on! <br>
DOCTOR: So, what are you? Oh, that's bad. Ah, that's extremely very not
good. <br>
(He turns around to find himself surrounded by Angels.) <br>
DOCTOR: Do not blink. <br>
(One grabs the back of his jacket collar.) <br>
DOCTOR: Argh!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Why am I not dead then? <br>
(The Angels are reaching towards the crack.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good, and not so good. Oh, this isn't even a little bit good. I
mean, is that it? Is that the power that brought you here? That's pure
Time Energy. You can't feed on that. That's now power, that's the fire
at the end of the universe. I'll tell you something else. <br>
(Bang! The Doctor runs into the forest without his jacket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Never let me talk!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIVER: Amy, what's wrong? <br>
AMY: Four. <br>
(Amy sways and sits down, then lies on the mossy tree trunk.) <br>
RIVER: Med scanner, now. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Doctor Song, we can't stay here. We've got to keep moving. <br>
RIVER: We wait for the Doctor. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Our mission is to make this wreckage safe and neutralise the
Angels. Until that is achieved <br>
RIVER: Father Octavian, when the Doctor's in the room, your one and
only mission is to keep him alive long enough to get everyone else
home. And trust me, it's not easy. Now, if he's dead back there, I'll
never forgive myself. And if he's alive, I'll never forgive him. And,
Doctor, you're standing right behind me, aren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. <br>
RIVER: I hate you. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't. Bishop, the Angels are in the forest. <br>
OCTAVIAN: We need visual contact on every line of approach. <br>
RIVER: How did you get past them? <br>
DOCTOR: I found a crack in the wall and told them it was the end of the
universe. <br>
AMY: What was it? <br>
DOCTOR: The end of the universe. Let's have a look, then. <br>
AMY: So, what's wrong with me? <br>
RIVER: Nothing. You're fine. <br>
DOCTOR: Everything. You're dying. <br>
RIVER: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. If we lie to her, she'll get all better.
Right. Amy, Amy, Amy. What's the matter with Amelia? Something's in her
eye. What does that mean? Does it mean anything? <br>
AMY: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Busy. <br>
AMY: Scared. <br>
DOCTOR: Course you're scared. You're dying. Shut up. <br>
RIVER: Okay, let him think. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened? She stared at the Angel. She looked into the
eyes of an Angel for too long <br>
MARCO: Sir! Angel incoming. <br>
PHILLIP: And here. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Keep visual contact. Do not let it move. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, come on, come on. Wakey, wakey. She watched an Angel
climb out of the screen. She stared at the Angel and, and <br>
AMY: The image of an Angel is an Angel. <br>
DOCTOR: A living mental image in a living human mind. But we stare at
them to stop them getting closer. We don't even blink, and that is
exactly what they want. Because as long as our eyes are open, they can
climb inside. There's an Angel in her mind. <br>
(The face of an Angel is visible in Amy's pupil.) <br>
AMY: Three. Doctor, it's coming. I can feel it. I'm going to die. <br>
DOCTOR: Please just shut up. I'm thinking. Now, counting. What's that
about? Bob, why are they making her count? <br>
BOB [OC]: To make her afraid, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, but why? What for? <br>
BOB [OC]: For fun, sir. <br>
(The Doctor throws the communicator away in annoyance.) <br>
AMY: Doctor, what's happening to me? Explain. <br>
DOCTOR: Inside your head, in the vision centres of your brain, there's
an Angel. It's like there's a screen, a virtual screen inside your mind
and the Angel is climbing out of it, and it's coming to shut you off. <br>
AMY: Then what I do? <br>
DOCTOR: If it was a real screen, what would we do? We'd pull the plug.
We'd kill the power. But we can't just knock her out, the Angel would
just take over. <br>
RIVER: Then what? Quickly. <br>
DOCTOR: We've got to shut down the vision centres of her brain. We've
got to pull the plug. Starve the Angel. <br>
RIVER: Doctor, she's got seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: How would you starve your lungs? <br>
RIVER: I'd stop breathing. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, close your eyes. <br>
AMY: No. No, I don't want to. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, because that's not you, that's the Angel inside you. It's
afraid. Do it. Close your eyes. <br>
(Amy squeezes her eyes shut. The med scanner changes from red to
green.) <br>
RIVER: She's normalising. Oh, you did it. You did it. <br>
PHILLIP: Sir? Two more incoming. <br>
PEDRO: Three more over here. <br>
RIVER: Still weak. Dangerous to move her. <br>
AMY: So, can I open my eyes now? <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, listen to me. If you open your eyes now for more than a
second, you will die. The Angel is still inside you. We haven't stopped
it, we've just sort of paused it. You've used up your countdown. You
cannot open your eyes. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Doctor, we're too exposed here. We have to move on. <br>
DOCTOR: We're too exposed everywhere. And Amy can't move. And anyway,
that's not the plan. <br>
RIVER: There's a plan? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know yet. I haven't finished talking. Right! Father,
you and your Clerics, you're going to stay here, look after Amy. If
anything happens to her, I'll hold every single one of you personally
responsible, twice. River, you and me, we're going to find the Primary
Flight Deck which is <br>
(He wets a finger and holds it up.) <br>
DOCTOR: A quarter of a mile straight ahead, and from there we're going
to stabilise the wreckage, stop the Angels, and cure Amy. <br>
RIVER: How? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll do a thing. <br>
RIVER: What thing? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. It's a thing in progress. Respect the thing.
Moving out! <br>
OCTAVIAN: Doctor, I'm coming with you. My Clerics'll look after Miss
Pond. These are my best men. They'd lay down their lives in her
protection. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't need you. <br>
OCTAVIAN: I don't care. Where Doctor Song goes, I go. <br>
DOCTOR: What? You two engaged or something? <br>
OCTAVIAN: Yes, in a manner of speaking. Marco, you're in charge till I
get back. <br>
MARCO: Sir. <br>
AMY: Doctor? Please, can't I come with you? <br>
OCTAVIAN: You'd slow us down, Miss Pond. <br>
AMY: I don't want to sound selfish, but you'd really speed me up. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll be safer here. We can't protect you on the move. I'll be
back for you soon as I can, I promise. <br>
AMY: You always say that. <br>
DOCTOR: I always come back. Good luck, everyone. Behave. Do not let
that girl open her eyes. And keep watching the forest. Stop those
Angels advancing. Amy, later. River, going to need your computer! <br>
AMY: Yeah. Later. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, you need to start trusting me. It's never been more
important. <br>
AMY: But you don't always tell me the truth. <br>
DOCTOR: If I always told you the truth, I wouldn't need you to trust
me. <br>
AMY: Doctor, the crack in my wall. How can it be here? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know yet, but I'm working it out. Now, listen. Remember
what I told you when you were seven? <br>
AMY: What did you tell me? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, that's not the point. You have to remember. <br>
AMY: Remember what? Doctor? Doctor? <br>
(The Doctor catches up with Octavian and River, and inputs the readings
from his sonic screwdriver into her mini-computer.) <br>
RIVER: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, readings from a crack in the wall. <br>
RIVER: How can a crack in the wall be the end of the universe? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't know, but here's what I think. One day there's going to
be a very big bang. So big every moment in history, past and future,
will crack. <br>
RIVER: Is that possible? How? <br>
DOCTOR: How can you be engaged, in a manner of speaking? <br>
RIVER: Well, sucker for a man in uniform. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Doctor Song's in my personal custody. I released her from the
Stormcage Containment Facility four days ago and I am legally
responsible for her until she's accomplished her mission and earned her
pardon. Just so we understand each other. <br>
DOCTOR: You were in Stormcage? <br>
(The computer chirps.) <br>
RIVER: What? What is that? <br>
DOCTOR: The date. The date of the explosion, where the crack begins. <br>
RIVER: And for those of us who can't read the base code of the
universe? <br>
(26 06 2010) <br>
DOCTOR: Amy's time. <br>
(Back at the mossy log.) <br>
AMY: So, what's happening? Anything happening out there? <br>
(The Angels push their hands into the Treeborgs, and the light starts
to flicker.) <br>
MARCO: The Angels are still grouping. Are you getting this too? <br>
PHILLIP: The trees? Yeah. <br>
AMY: What's wrong with the trees? <br>
PEDRO: Here too, sir. They're ripping the Treeborgs apart. <br>
PHILLIP: And here. They're taking out the lights. <br>
AMY: What is it? What's happening? Tell me. I can't see. <br>
MARCO: It's the trees. ma'am. The trees are going out.
