kicking a football on the tiny front lawn while doting Dad washes the

DALE: Yes! <br>

scene is watched from an upstairs window by a young girl. An old woman
wheels her shopping bag along the pavement nervously. The young girl's
mother puts the rubbish out.) <br>

MAEVE: No, love, I'm not. <br>
TRISH: Do you want me to call a doctor? <br>

TRISH: I can't feel anything. <br>

between the open ground and the housing estate.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! <br>

ROSE: No way! Why didn't I think of this? That's great. <br>
DOCTOR: Only seems like yesterday a few naked Greek blokes were tossing
a discus about, wrestling each other in the sand with crowds stood
around baying. No, wait a minute, that was Club Med. Just in time for
the opening doo dah, ceremony, tonight, I thought you'd like that. Last
one they had in London was dynamite. Wembley, 1948. I loved it so much,
I went back and watched it all over again. Fella carrying the torch.
Lovely chap, what was his? <br>
(Tom's dad is putting up Missing posters on the lampposts.) <br>
DOCTOR: Mark? John? Mark? Legs like pipe cleaners, but strong as a

(John Mark, 1925-1991) <br>
ROSE: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: And in those days, everybody had a tea party to go to. <br>
ROSE: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Did you ever have one of those little cakes with the crunchy
ball bearings on top? <br>
ROSE: You should really look at this. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know those things? Nobody else in this entire galaxy's
ever even bothered to make edible ball bearings. Genius. <br>
(The Doctor goes to Rose, and reads the two posters. The boy's name is
Dale Hicks.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's taking them, do you think? Snatching children from a
thoroughly ordinary street like this. Why's it so cold? Is someone
reducing the temperature? <br>
ROSE: It says they all went missing this week. Why would a person do
something like this? <br>
DOCTOR: What makes you think it's a person? <br>
(A woman puts out her rubbish and goes straight back inside. There is
no one else about apart from the council roadmenders and their white
van.) <br>
ROSE: Whatever it is, it's got the whole street scared to death.
Doctor, what <br>
(The Doctor has run up the street to investigate the front lawn and its
goal. He holds his hand out over the grass. A man in a Mini drives into
the road, and the engine gives out. One of the road menders comes over
to help.) <br>
KEL: There you go. Fifth today. Not natural, is it? <br>
DRIVER: I don't know what happened, I had it serviced less than a month
ago. <br>
KEL: Nah, don't even try and explain it, mate. All the cars are doing
it. And do you know what? It's bonkers. Bonkers. Come on then, pal.
I'll help you shift it. Quicker you're on the way, happier you'll be. <br>
(The two men start pushing the car.) <br>
KEL: There we go. <br>
ROSE: Do you want a hand? <br>
KEL: No, we're all right, love. <br>
ROSE: You're not. I'm tougher than I look, honest. <br>
(Rose joins Kel pushing at the back, and the engine suddenly bursts
into life. Kel falls over, the driver gets back in drives off.) <br>
ROSE: Does this happen a lot? <br>
DRIVER: Cheers, mate! <br>
KEL: Been doing it all week. <br>
ROSE: Since those children started going missing? <br>
KEL: Yeah, I suppose so. <br>
(Back at the goal.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, tickles! <br>
TOM'S DAD: What's your game? <br>
DOCTOR: My er. Snakes and Ladders? Quite good at squash. Reasonable.
I'm being facetious, aren't I. There's no call for it. <br>
KEL: Every car cuts out. The council are going nuts. I mean, they've
given this street the works. Renamed it. I've been tarmacking every pot
hole. Look at that. Beauty, init? Yeah! And all that is because that
Olympic Torch comes right by the end of this Close. Just down there.
Everything's got to be perfect, ain't it? Only it ain't. <br>
MAEVE: It takes them when they're playing. <br>
ROSE: What takes them? <br>
MAEVE: Danny, Jane, Dale. Snatched in the blink of an eye. <br>
(Tom's dad has the Doctor backing away onto the road.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm, I'm a police officer! That's what I am. I've got a badge
and a police car. You don't have to get. I can, I can prove it. Just
hold on. <br>
TOM'S DAD: We've had plenty of coppers poking around here, and you
don't look or sound like any of them. <br>
DOCTOR: See, look. I've got a colleague. Lewis. <br>
TOM'S DAD: Well, she looks less like a copper than you do. <br>
DOCTOR: Training. New recruit. It was either that or hairdressing, so,
voila! <br>
(The Doctor brandishes his psychic paper in front of Tom's dad.) <br>
TRISH: What are you going to do? <br>
MAEVE: The police have knocked on every door. No clues, no leads,
nothing. <br>
TOM'S DAD: Look, kids run off sometimes, all right? That's what they
do. <br>
MAEVE: Saw it with me own eyes. Dale Hicks in your garden, playing with
your Tommy, and then pfft! Right in front of me, like he was never
there. There's no need to look any further than this street. It's right
here amongst us. <br>
DOCTOR: Why don't we <br>
WOMAN: Why don't we start with him? There's been all sorts like him in
this street, day and night. <br>
KEL: Fixing things up for the Olympics. <br>
TOM'S DAD: Yeah, and taking an awful long time about it. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm of the opinion that all we've got to do is just <br>
KEL: You don't. What you just said, that's slander! <br>
WOMAN: I don't care what it is. <br>
DOCTOR: I think we need to just <br>
KEL: I want an apology off her. <br>
MAEVE: Stop picking on him. <br>
KEL: Yeah, stop picking on me. <br>
MAEVE: And stop pretending to be blind. It's evil! <br>
WOMAN: I don't believe in evil. <br>
KEL: Oh no, you just believe in tarmackers with sack loads of kidnapped
kiddies in their van. <br>
TOM'S DAD: Here, here, here, that's not what she's saying. <br>
KEL: Would you stop ganging up on me. <br>
WOMAN: Feeling guilty, are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Fingers on lips! <br>
(Everyone joins the Doctor in making the Shush gesture.) <br>
DOCTOR: In the last six days, three of your children have been stolen.
Snatched out of thin air, right? <br>
MAEVE: Er, can I? Look around you. This was a safe street till it came.
It's not a person. I'll say it if no one else will. Maybe you're
coppers, maybe you're not. I don't care who you are. Can you please
help us? <br>
(Rose looks up at Chloe in the window. Trish notices and goes back
inside. Later, the Doctor is back at Tom's house, sniffing.) <br>
ROSE: Want a hanky? <br>
DOCTOR: Can you smell it? What does it remind you of? <br>
ROSE: Sort of metal? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. <br>
ROSE: Oh. </font></p>

a jennel in my part of the world.) <br>
DOCTOR: Danny Edwards cycled in one end but never came out the other.
Whoa, there it goes again! Look at the hairs on the back of my manly
hairy hand. <br>
ROSE: And there's that smell. It's like a er, a burnt fuse plug or
something. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a residual energy in the spots where the kids vanished.
Whatever it was, it used an awful lot of power to do this. </font></p>

then settles down to draw again.) <br>
TRISH: You have to come down some time, Chloe. <br>
CHLOE: I'm busy, mum. <br>
TRISH: Look at it in here. You must've used up half a rainforest. <br>
(Chloe is drawing the cat on Dale's picture. He is now sitting in the
bottom left corner.) <br>
TRISH: That's Dale. Why did you draw him so sad? <br>
CHLOE: I didn't draw him like that. Dale made himself sad, so I'm going
to draw him a friend. That's what he needs. More friends. <br>
TRISH: Have you seen the TV? <br>
(Trish clicks on Chloe's laptop, and News24 comes on with its live
Countdown to the Games. Huw Edwards' soft Welsh lilt provides the
commentary.) <br>
TRISH: Look, this'll cheer you up. The Torch is getting close. It'll
pass right by our street. And tonight they'll light the Olympic Flame
in the stadium, and the whole world will be looking at our city. I
mean, doesn't that make you feel part of something? Sweetheart? Chloe? <br>
CHLOE: I'm busy, mum. <br>
HUW EDWARDS [OC]: Danny Fairweather carries the torch past them on this
wonderful summer's day. Very fitting. We've seen lots of our sporting
royalty, too. <br>
TRISH: Okay. You're tired, Chloe. I heard you calling out again, last
night. <br>
CHLOE: It's fine. <br>
TRISH: Nightmares? <br>
CHLOE: I'm drawing! <br>
TRISH: Whatever they are, they're just dreams, you do know that? They
can't hurt you. <br>
CHLOE: I'm busy. Unless you want me to draw you, mum. <br>
TRISH: If you want to stay cooped up in here, fine. I'll leave you to

DOCTOR: Thanks! I'm experimenting with back combing. Oh. <br>
(Rose is talking to the ginger cat.) <br>
ROSE: I used to have one like you. What? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm not really a cat person. Once you've been threatened by
one in a nun's wimple, it kind of takes the joy out of it. <br>
(The cat goes inside cardboard box.) <br>
ROSE: Come here, puss. What do you want to go in there for? <br>
(There is a distant meow. The box is empty.) <br>
ROSE: Doctor! Phew. <br>
(The smell is very strong.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Ion residue. Blimey! That takes some
doing. Just to snatch a living organism out of space-time. This baby is
just like, I'm having some of that. I'm impressed. <br>
ROSE: So the cat's been transported? <br>
DOCTOR: It can harness huge reserves of ionic power. We need to find
the source of that power. Find the source and you will find whatever
has taken to stealing children and fluffy animals. See what you can
see. Keep them peeled, Lewis. </font></p>

Moan, moan, moan. You're lucky. You're all together. You don't know
what it is to be alone. If you did, you'd be thanking me. No! (Under
the gaze of Danny's picture, frustrated Chloe does a big scribble on a
piece of paper.)

houses with the integral garage next to the front door. Rose hears a
noise coming from one of them.)&nbsp;<br>
ROSE: Is that you, puss cat? Are you trapped? <br>

ROSE: Not going to open it, not going to open it, not going to open it <br>
(The door is unlocked. Rose gently opens it and a big ball of scribble
knocks her down. The Doctor comes running.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stay still! <br>
(He points his sonic screwdriver, and the ball becomes hand-sized. Rose
grabs it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okey dokey? <br>
ROSE: Yeah, cheers. <br>
DOCTOR: No probs. I'll give you a fiver if you can tell me what the
hell it is, because I haven't got the foggiest. <br>
ROSE: Well, I can tell you you've just killed it. <br>
DOCTOR: It was never living. It's animated by energy. Same energy
that's snatching people. That is so dinky! The go anywhere creature.
Fits in your pocket, makes friends, impresses the boss, breaks the ice
at parties.

DOCTOR: Oh, hi ho, here we go. Let's have a look. Get out of here. <br>
ROSE: What's it say? <br>
(The Doctor uses the eraser end of a pencil on the ball, and rubs some
of it out.) <br>
DOCTOR: It is. It's graphite. Basically the same material as an HB
pencil. <br>
ROSE: I was attacked by a pencil scribble? <br>
DOCTOR: Scribble creature, brought into being with ionic energy.
Whatever we're dealing with, it can create things as well as take them.
But why make a scribble creature? <br>
ROSE: Maybe it was a mistake I mean, you scribble over something when
you want to
get rid of it, like a, like a drawing. Like a, a child's drawing. You
said it was in the street. <br>
DOCTOR: Probably. <br>
ROSE: The girl. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course! What girl? <br>
ROSE: Something about her gave me the creeps. Even her own mum looked
scared of her. <br>

HUW EDWARDS [OC]: The Torch Bearer is running up the Mall, which I can
tell you is <br>
TRISH: She stays in her room most of the time. I try talking to her,
but it's like trying to speak to a brick wall. She gives me nothing,
just asks to be left alone. <br>
ROSE: What about Chloe's dad? <br>
TRISH: Chloe's dad died a year ago. <br>
ROSE: I'm sorry. <br>
TRISH: You wouldn't be if you'd known him. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's go and say hi. <br>
TRISH: I should check on her first. She might be asleep. <br>
DOCTOR: Why are you afraid of her, Trish? <br>
TRISH: I want you to know before you see her that's she's really a
great kid. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sure she is. <br>
TRISH: She's never been in trouble at school you should see her report
from last year. A's and B's. <br>
ROSE: Can I use your loo? <br>
TRISH: She's in the choir. She's singing in an old folks home. Any mum
would be proud. You know I want you to know these things before you see
her, Doctor, because right now, she's not herself.&nbsp;<br>
(Rose goes upstairs, and hides in the airing closet as Chloe comes out
of her room and goes downstairs. She goes into Chloe's room and sees
the wall covered in drawings, including Dale and the cat. There is a
noise from the wardrobe, and she knocks over a jar of coloured pencils.
When she's picked them up again, Dale is scowling.)

TRISH: He's dead. And these, they're kid's pictures. Now get out! <br>
ROSE: Chloe has a power. And I don't know how, but she used it to take
Danny Edwards, Dale Hicks. She's using it to snatch the kids. <br>

ROSE: Have you seen those drawings move? <br>
TRISH: I haven't seen anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you have, out of the corner of your eye. <br>
TRISH: No. <br>
DOCTOR: And you dismissed it, because what choice do you have when you
see something you can't possibly explain? You dismiss it, right? And if
anyone mentions it, you get angry, so it's never spoken of, ever again.
<br>
TRISH: She's a child. <br>
DOCTOR: You're terrified of her. But there's nowhere to turn to,
because who's going to
believe the things you see out of the corner of your eye? No one.

place them in some kid of holding pen made up of ionic power. <br>
ROSE: And what about the dad from hell in her wardrobe? <br>
TRISH: How many times do I have to tell you he's dead. <br>
ROSE: Well, he's got a very loud voice for a dead bloke. <br>
DOCTOR: If living things can become drawings, then maybe drawings can

visits her in her nightmares. That dad seems very real. That's the dad
she's drawn and he's a heartbeat away from crashing into this world. <br>

salute when the Doctor enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nice one. <br>

mind meld, while we're on the Spock theme. He lays her back on the

CHLOE: I want Chloe. Wake her up. I want Chloe. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? <br>
CHLOE: I want Chloe Webber. <br>
TRISH: What've you done to my little girl? <br>
ROSE: Doctor, what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm speaking to you, the entity that is using this human child.
I request
parley in compliance with the Shadow Proclamation. <br>
CHLOE: I don't care about shadows or parleys. <br>
DOCTOR: So what do you care about? <br>
CHLOE: I want my friends. <br>
DOCTOR: You're lonely, I know. Identify yourself. <br>
CHLOE: I am one of many. I travel with my brothers and sisters. We take
an endless journey. A thousand of your lifetimes. But now I am alone. I
hate it. It's not fair, and I hate it. <br>
DOCTOR: Name yourself! <br>
CHLOE: Isolus. <br>
DOCTOR: You're Isolus. Of course. <br>
CHLOE: Our journey began in the Deep Realms when we were a family. <br>
(The Isolus is drawing as she speaks.) <br>
TRISH: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: The Isolus Mother, drifting in deep space. See, she jettisons
millions of fledgling spores. Her children. The Isolus are empathic
beings of intense emotions, but when they're cast off from their
mother, their empathic link, their need for each other, is what
sustains them. They need to be together. They cannot be alone. <br>
CHLOE: Our journey is long. <br>
DOCTOR: The Isolus children travel, each inside a pod. They ride the
heat and energy of solar tides. It takes thousands and thousands of
years for them to grow up. <br>
ROSE: Thousands of years just floating through space. Poor things.
Don't they go mad with boredom? <br>
CHLOE: We play. <br>
ROSE: You play? <br>
DOCTOR: While they travel, they play games. They use their ionic power
to literally create make believe worlds in which to play. <br>
ROSE: In flight entertainment. <br>
DOCTOR: Helps keep them happy. While they're happy, they can feed off
each others love. Without it, they're lost. Why did you come to Earth? <br>
CHLOE: We were too close. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a solar flare from your sun. Would have made a tidal
wave of solar energy that scattered the Isolus pods. <br>
CHLOE: Only I fell to Earth. My brothers and sisters are left up there,
and I cannot reach them. So alone. <br>
DOCTOR: Your pod crashed. Where is it? <br>
(Memory of a tiny white flower-like being flying into Chloe's room and
then into her mouth.) <br>
CHLOE: My pod was drawn to heat, and I was drawn to Chloe Webber. She
was like me, alone. She needed me, and I her. <br>
DOCTOR: You empathised with her. You wanted to be with her because she
was alone like you. <br>
CHLOE: I want my family. It's not fair. <br>
DOCTOR: I understand. You want to make a family. But you can't stay in
this child. It's wrong. You can't steal any more friends for yourself. <br>
CHLOE: I am alone. <br>
(A crash from the wardrobe. A red glow and the door shakes. Chloe is
shaking.) <br>
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: I'm coming to hurt you. I'm coming. <br>
DOCTOR: Trish, how do you calm her? <br>
TRISH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: When she has nightmares, what do you do? <br>
TRISH: I, I <br>
DOCTOR: What do you do? <br>
TRISH: I sing to her. <br>
DOCTOR: Then start singing. <br>
CHLOE'S DAD [OC]: Chloe, I'm coming. <br>

The day he crashed the car, I thought we were free. I thought it was
over. <br>
ROSE: Did you talk to her about it? <br>
TRISH: I didn't want to. <br>
ROSE: But maybe that's why Chloe feels so alone. Because she has all
these terrible dreams about her dad, but she can't talk to you about
them. <br>
DOCTOR: Her and the Isolus. Two lonely kids who need each other. <br>
ROSE: And it won't stop, will it, Doctor? It'll just keep pulling kids
in. <br>

ROSE: Feels to me like a temper tantrum because it can't get its own

ROSE: I've got cousins. Kids can't have it all their own way. That's

Rose. Some of the most terrible acts ever committed have been inspired
by them. We're not dealing with something that wants to conquer or
destroy. There's a lot of things you need to get across this universe.
