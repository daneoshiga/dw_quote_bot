<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A Corporal is walking through the undergrowth of
Tubney Wood as if in a trance. He stares blankly ahead, and his right
arm twitches from time to time. After he has passed, the Tardis
materialises in a small clearing by a clump of purple loose-strife and
some oak saplings. The Doctor steps out and takes a drink from a small
bottle.) <br>
SARAH [OC]: Well, come on, make your mind up. Has the Tardis brought us
home or not? <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly. <br>
(Sarah comes out of the Tardis and shuts the door.) <br>
SARAH: What do you mean, possibly. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the coordinates were set for your time, but the linear
calculator, well. Ginger pop? <br>
SARAH: Can't stand the stuff, thanks all the same. So we could be
anytime, anywhere? <br>
DOCTOR: I really must get the Tardis seen to. She's way overdue her
five hundred year service. <br>
SARAH: Well, at least we're on Earth. I mean, just taste that air. I
love that fresh smell just after a rain shower. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it does have that peculiar earthy smell. Which is odd when
you look at the ground. <br>
SARAH: Hmm? <br>
DOCTOR: It's bone dry. Can't have been any rain here for more than a
week. <br>
(The Doctor takes a small device out of his pocket. It beeps.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now I wonder what could be causing that. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Some enormous release of energy. <br>
SARAH: We are on Earth, aren't we? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, unless someone's started exporting acorns. Oak trees
don't grow anywhere else in the Galaxy. <br>
SARAH: Bet we're miles away from UNIT HQ though. So, what are we going
to do? <br>
(The Doctor calls off the points of the compass.) <br>
DOCTOR: Eenie, meenie, minie, mo? <br>
(They head off in the same direction as the soldier.) <br>
DOCTOR: Watch the bramble. <br>
SARAH: Ow. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you to watch the bramble. <br>
SARAH: Listen, what's so special about eenie meenie minie mo? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. It could just as easily have be fum fo fee fi. <br>
SARAH: Fee fi fo fum. <br>
(The Doctor and Sarah walk out of sight, and the twitching soldier
reappears, walking off at ninety degrees to their direction. Later - ) <br>
SARAH: Hang on. I thought I saw someone. <br>
(Four figures in white protective suits and helmets come out of the
trees ahead.) <br>
DOCTOR: Let's hope they're not strangers here themselves. Hello there! <br>
SARAH: No. Wait, Doctor. I don't like the look of them. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Please excuse me. Could you be very kind and tell me
where we are? <br>
(The figures raise their right arms and point at the Doctor. The
fingers are guns, and they work. Sarah and the Doctor run for cover in
the trees. The figures follow.) <br>
DOCTOR: I thought it was odd. Didn't you think it was odd? I remember
once at the battle of Malplaquet, I said to the Duke of Marlborough <br>
SARAH: Oh, come on, Doctor! Let's get out of here! Argh! <br>
(Sarah disappears into a growth of bracken and ends up rolling down a
slope towards a steep cliff. She manages to grab on to the edge.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah! Don't look down! <br>
(The Doctor gets to her and pulls her back to safety.) <br>
SARAH: Thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: My pleasure. Couldn't leave you hanging around in a place like
this. <br>
(They see the twitching soldier moving rapidly towards the cliff edge.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Stop, man. Stop! <br>
SARAH: No! No! <br>
(The soldier goes flying over the edge. The Doctor and Sarah find a
safe route down and go to check on him.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quarry]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: He must have died instantly. <br>
(Sarah picks up his beret badge.) <br>
SARAH: Look. He's from UNIT. <br>
(The Doctor checks his wallet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look at these. <br>
(The Doctor gives Sarah a handful of coins.) <br>
SARAH: They're all new.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Freshly minted. No scratches, tarnish. <br>
SARAH: And all dated the same year. <br>
DOCTOR: What are the odds against finding a pocket full of coins all
dated the same? <br>
SARAH: I don't understand it. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Nor do I, yet. <br>
(The Doctor has spotted a strange object nearby. Longer than a man,
black, egg-shaped, marked into quarters.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, come on, Doctor. It's just a load of old junk. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, shush, wait, wait. I've seen something like this
before. My memory's getting terrible. You know, three hundred years ago
I'd have recognised this like a shot. <br>
(Weapons fire. The Doctor falls.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Keep down! <br>
(They take cover behind the artefact. The Doctor looks round the end to
see two of the figures. Another shot.) <br>
DOCTOR: Something seems to have annoyed them again. Come on. <br>
(They run off and up a slope to a cornfield, then along the margins as
the figures try to pursue, but stop at the field and turn back.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Village]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Sarah enter a rural village,
played by East Hagbourne.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, well. Well, well. <br>
SARAH: Devesham. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
(The place is deserted.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor, we're at Devesham. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know it? <br>
SARAH: I came here on a story about two years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a bit quiet. <br>
SARAH: Yes. <br>
(The Doctor goes up the steps of the stone cross in the middle of the
roads.) <br>
DOCTOR: Anyone about? Anyone? <br>
(The half-timbered houses are silent.) <br>
DOCTOR: No one about. Let's try the pub.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Fleur de Lys]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It is open, but empty. There are two nearly full
pint jugs on the bar. Another jug and a glass of wine on a table, more
on another.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello? Innkeeper? <br>
SARAH: Hello? Anyone about? <br>
DOCTOR: What's this pub called? <br>
SARAH: Er, Fleur de Lys, wasn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
SARAH: Fleur de Lys. <br>
DOCTOR: Marie Celeste, more like it. <br>
SARAH: It's weird. A whole village full of people can't just disappear.
<br>
(The Doctor opens the till.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here it is again. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Freshly minted money, all the same year. Sarah? <br>
SARAH: Hmm? <br>
DOCTOR: What was that story you came here on? <br>
SARAH: There was a bit of a brouhaha at the Space Defence Station. It's
about a mile from here. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it. If we've landed in a prohibited area, then those people
who shot at us were possibly guards. <br>
SARAH: Trespassers are prosecuted in England, not killed. Anyway, they
weren't dressed like guards. <br>
DOCTOR: Protective clothing? Some kind of radioactivity? Remember, I
detected an energy source. The soldier who went over the cliff was
possibly affected by it. <br>
SARAH: Radiation sickness? <br>
DOCTOR: Something like that. <br>
SARAH: And this place, the village? <br>
DOCTOR: Evacuated. <br>
SARAH: Then it must've been done in a hurry. <br>
DOCTOR: If some dangerous substance leaked, it would be an emergency. <br>
SARAH: That's great. And we've been walking around in the middle of it
like a couple of 'narnas. <br>
DOCTOR: It's only a speculation. <br>
SARAH: It's a nasty one. What about the money? <br>
DOCTOR: Contamination precaution. Money changes hands. In a place like
this, it might be necessary to bring in clean currency every few
months. <br>
(Sarah looks out of the window.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Huh? <br>
SARAH: The village isn't deserted anymore. <br>
(The four figures are walking down the road from the church, escorting
a soldier.) <br>
SARAH: No, it can't be. It can't be! <br>
DOCTOR: That's impossible. <br>
(As they pass the pub, it is clearly the Lance Corporal, no longer
twitching or dead.) <br>
SARAH: He was dead. We saw him. <br>
(Sarah steps back and knocks into a table. The empty glasses fall over
and one smashes on the floor. Outside, the group stops, then approaches
the front door.) <br>
SARAH: They heard me. <br>
DOCTOR: Wait. <br>
(A pick-up van drives up with a group of villagers sitting in the back.
Young, old, the vicar in his panama hat. They stand when the engine is
turned off. A white-suited figure gets out of the cab and unfastens the
side. The people step down and go on their way, blank and staring.) <br>
SARAH: (sotto) The man in the tweed jacket, that's Mister Morgan, the
landlord. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Come on. <br>
(They go through an internal door and shut it behind them. Morgan leads
the soldier and several people into the pub. The Doctor and Sarah open
the door slightly and watch as they resume their places and their
drinks, still as statues. Then the clock chimes and they all come to
life.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Extraordinary. <br>
SARAH: What's the matter with them? <br>
DOCTOR: I haven't the faintest idea, but I intend to find out. <br>
SARAH: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Space Defence Station. I could contact UNIT from there. You
stay here and keep an eye on things. <br>
SARAH: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll be all right. <br>
SARAH: I've heard that before. <br>
DOCTOR: Can you find your way back to the Tardis? <br>
SARAH: Of course I can. <br>
(The Doctor gives her the Tardis key.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right. If anything goes wrong, meet me there. <br>
SARAH: And what if <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The previously dead soldier notices the door knob
turning, and pulls it open suddenly. Sarah nearly falls into the bar.
Everyone stares at her.) <br>
SARAH: Afternoon. Well, just about, anyway. Hallo. Mister Morgan, isn't
it? You remember me, don't you? Sarah Jane Smith? I came here on a
story. I stayed here about two years ago. <br>
(Silence and blank stares.) <br>
SARAH: Well, somebody say something. <br>
ADAMS: Who sent you? <br>
SARAH: What do you mean, who sent me? <br>
ADAMS: How did you get here? <br>
SARAH: I walked. Look, perhaps you'd like <br>
ADAMS: What are you doing here? <br>
SARAH: Do you allow all your customers to be grilled like this? <br>
ADAMS: We don't have strangers here. <br>
SARAH: Oh, come on, that's ridiculous. <br>
MORGAN: Wait. She may be part of the test. <br>
SARAH: Test? What test? <br>
ADAMS: She doesn't know. <br>
SARAH: What don't I know? Look, what's going on here? <br>
MORGAN: I think you'd better go, Miss. <br>
SARAH: Why? <br>
MORGAN: It might be best. <br>
SARAH: Look, if there's some sort of trouble, perhaps I could help. I
see. Well, I intend to find out, anyway. <br>
(Sarah backs towards the door. The soldier steps towards her.) <br>
SARAH: And I'm sure you shouldn't be drinking so soon after breaking
your neck. <br>
(Sarah leaves very quickly. The pick up is still outside with the
figure facing forward. It's visor is open. She hides behind the vehicle
and the figure turns round. Instead of a face, it has circuitry. Sarah
runs back towards the woods and it watches her go.)

Establishment I think - with a giant radio telescope added and no
perimeter security. The Doctor strolls through the paved courtyard and
through the main sliding doors. He finds a blank armed soldier in the
reception area.) <br>
DOCTOR: Can you tell me where I can find the CO? The Commanding
Officer? <br>
(No reply.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'll tell you what. I won't bother you. <br>
(The Doctor goes down a corridor and looks in the first room he comes
through. The soldier does not follow so he carries on out of our sight.
Then the soldier slowly turns to look.)

the key in the lock when she notices the artefact from the quarry
sitting nearby. She leaves the key in the lock and goes to investigate.
The Tardis starts up.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! Don't go! I'm still here! <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
SARAH: Don't leave me. <br>
(The artefact begins to open.) <br>
SARAH: Can't have gone. <br>
(A hand from the artefact grabs her leg. Sarah squeals and runs away a
few steps, then turns to a shiny-looking man is lying inside it. She
goes back and kneels next to him.) <br>
SARAH: Can I help you? <br>
(The man grabs her around the throat, but she gets free and runs back
into the woods.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A man with a patch over his left eye is startled
by the intercom. He runs into his office to answer the
permanently annoyed voice.) <br>
STYGGRON [OC]: Crayford! Crayford! Crayford, I say. <br>
CRAYFORD: Yes, Styggron. <br>
STYGGRON [OC]: I ordered all units to recharge stations. The order is
not being observed. <br>
CRAYFORD: In what way, Styggron? <br>
STYGGRON [OC]: We have detected movement within the complex. A unit may
have gone random. Check and report! <br>
CRAYFORD: Yes, Styggron. Immediately, Styggron. <br>
(Crayford goes out of his office, pauses and goes into the next room.
The Doctor comes through a fire door and along the hall. He stops at
the room Crayford has gone into then notices the name plate on
Crayford's office. Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart. He knocks and enters) </font></p>

(The Doctor reads a note on the desk, then picks up an Ordnance Survey
map and starts to unfold it. Crayford enters through an interconnecting
door with a gun in his hand.) <br>
CRAYFORD: Keep your hands where I can see them. <br>
DOCTOR: Those are the first friendly words I've heard since I got here.
<br>
CRAYFORD: Yes, I dare say. And just how did you get here, incidentally?
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I dropped in. You know, I do from time to time. <br>
CRAYFORD: I can easily get the truth from you. <br>
DOCTOR: You're getting it. <br>
(Crayford snatches the map.) <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? <br>
CRAYFORD: I'm asking the questions and I have the gun. <br>
DOCTOR: I just wondered. You're in someone else's office. It says
Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart on the door. <br>
CRAYFORD: You know the Brigadier? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. I'm his unpaid scientific advisor. <br>
CRAYFORD: Oh yes. Yes, I see. I see, you're the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
CRAYFORD: Yes, I've heard of you. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Who are you? <br>
CRAYFORD: I'm the Senior Defence astronaut, Guy Crayford. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, how do you do. <br>
CRAYFORD: Get your hands up, Doctor, thank you. You could be an
impostor, couldn't you. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, I've got a suggestion. My arms are beginning to ache. Why
not call Lethbridge Stewart and get him to identify me? <br>
CRAYFORD: Lethbridge Stewart is in Geneva. Colonel Faraday is in
command. <br>
(Crayford presses a button the intercom.) <br>
DOCTOR: If you're calling the butler, I'm very partial to tea and
muffins. <br>
CRAYFORD: You're going to have to stay in detention until your
identity's been verified. <br>

from lower levels, the Doctor runs along the parapet and jumps down
onto a gravel area, where one then two white-suited figures are
pointing their fingers at him. Sarah sees all this.) <br>

and follows.)

DOCTOR [OC]: Sarah, what are you doing here? <br>
SARAH: Rescuing you, actually. For a change. <br>

gone wrong? <br>

STYGGRON: These patterns were not programmed. Explain. <br>
CRAYFORD [on monitor]: Styggron, was this second unit a female? <br>
STYGGRON: Yes, one of the village section. Check the directives. A
fault must have developed. <br>
CRAYFORD [on monitor: It's not a fault, Styggron, it's a remarkable
success. <br>
STYGGRON: A success? <br>
CRAYFORD [on monitor]: They are space travellers. The Doctor, as he is
called, is a humanoid, a scientist who advices on Earth Defence. His
companion is human. <br>
STYGGRON: I see. Then they are externals. <br>
CRAYFORD [on monitor]: They've arrived by error. <br>
STYGGRON: Perhaps by error, perhaps by design. <br>

DOCTOR: How? <br>

was out in space, deep space, and then they lost him. The ship just
vanished. They thought he'd hit an asteroid. <br>

pattern analysis. <br>
CRAYFORD: But Styggron, we already have a complete pattern for the

SARAH: All the same, the sooner we get away from here, the better. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite right. Any level of radiation is too high, and it's
getting worse all the time. Won't be long before the place becomes
uninhabitable. That's why the Kraals are planning to leave and take
over Earth. <br>
SARAH: So, everything we've seen has been a fake. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, it is impressive, but doomed to fail in the end. <br>
CRAYFORD: Oh no, Doctor. No, shortly I shall leave for Earth. The
Kraals will project me through the space time warp and my ship will
make a normal re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. <br>
DOCTOR: A normal re-entry? Crayford, you've been gone two years,
assumed dead. <br>
CRAYFORD: Ah, yes, Doctor, but I have recently re-established radio
contact with Earth. They know about the stabiliser failure that sent me
into orbit around Jupiter. They know how I've rationed my provisions,
particularly drinking water. My recycling experiments. Already, every
telescope on Earth is trained on that little patch of sky where my XK-5
will reappear. <br>
DOCTOR: A gigantic hoax. <br>
CRAYFORD: Exactly, Doctor, yes! And all brilliantly planned by
Styggron, the chief scientist of the <br>
DOCTOR: But helped by you. He couldn't have done it without your
knowledge and memory. <br>
CRAYFORD: Yes, the Kraals have a superb technology, Doctor. <br>
SARAH: Why did you do it? What made you betray Earth? <br>
CRAYFORD: Well, didn't Earth betray me? I was written off, wasn't I?
Left to die in space. It was the Kraals who saved me. I mean, I was
dying, wasn't I? I was being torn apart by gyro failure. And they
reconstructed me, Miss Smith, in every detail. Except the one eye that
for some reason couldn't be found. Oh no, I owe them everything. <br>
SARAH: And that's what they want. Everything. They want the world. <br>
CRAYFORD: Look, the increasing radiation here means that they're a
doomed race. They just have to leave, don't they. I mean, why should a
people with such skills be allowed to die? <br>
SARAH: The human race has a few skills of its own. <br>
CRAYFORD: Yes, I know, I know. But the Kraals have promised me that no
humans will be harmed, as long as they obey the ultimatum that's been
prepared. You see, the Kraals are going to take over the northern
hemisphere and live in peace! I have their word for it. <br>
DOCTOR: You've been brainwashed, Crayford. <br>
CRAYFORD: Before my spaceship lands, the space shells with the androids
inside will be launched. Now, if anyone sees them, they'll just be
taken for meteorites, you see? And then the androids will take over the
key positions in the Defence Complex and the way will be clear for
Marshall Chedaki to bring in the main invasion fleet without a shot
being fired! <br>
DOCTOR: I see, I see. Tell me, if your Kraal friends are so unviolent,
why did Styggron try to vaporise me? <br>
CRAYFORD: Oh, yes. Yes, well, they thought you were a danger. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
CRAYFORD: You see, Miss Smith's memory prints had showed your past
intense involvement in the defence of Earth. But I have persuaded them
to utilise that knowledge. It won't be wasted. See, Styggron's machine
extracts and feeds into a computer the memory and entire intelligence
of any living being. It's painful, I know, but it's better than dying. <br>
STYGGRON [OC]: Service mechanics move to leader rocket loading bay now.

DOCTOR: So you do intend genocide. <br>
STYGGRON: Earth's resources are limited. They cannot be wasted
supporting an inferior species. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you intend to destroy the humans, Styggron? If you use
nuclear weapons, you'll raise Earth's radiation level beyond your own
point of tolerance. <br>
STYGGRON: Nothing so crude as fission weapons. The androids will
disseminate a virus. It will cause a contagion so lethal the Earth will
be rid of its human population within three weeks. Then it will burn
itself out, and the world will be ours. <br>

of matches. Soon smoke comes out underneath the door into the corridor.

Sarah jabs the power cable at him. He writhes then goes bang, staggers
forward and collapses. His head explodes. Sarah makes her escape.) <br>
STYGGRON: In eight minutes, Doctor, the Analyser will have completed
its recording. Unfortunately, I shall not be here to turn it off. Your
brain tissue will expand under the stimulation until eventually, your
skull bursts. I imagine it will be a most disagreeable death. <br>

for mercy and there will be no one here. <br>

She hides as Styggron lumbers past then runs into the lab. Sarah takes
one look then goes to the control panel and turns the Analyser down.
She pushes another control, but that just ramps it up again so she
quickly reverses it. Finally it stops and she goes to free him.) <br>

BENTON: Mister Sullivan? He's gone up to the rocket with Colonel
Faraday. <br>
DOCTOR: Call him down. <br>
GRIERSON: I can't do that, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Call him down. <br>
BENTON: Better do as he says. <br>
GRIERSON: Hello? <br>
(The Doctor takes the microphone from Grierson.) <br>
DOCTOR: Give it to me. Harry? Harry, can you hear me? <br>
HARRY [OC]: Hello, Doctor. Is that you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Don't go into that rocket. <br>
FARADAY [OC]: I don't understand. What the Dickens is going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Just trust me, Colonel. If you go into that rocket, your lives
will be in deadly danger. <br>
FARADAY [OC]: Chap's insane. <br>
HARRY [OC]: I think we ought to do as he says, Colonel. <br>
DOCTOR: Harry, bring the lift down. I'll explain it all then. <br>
FARADAY [OC]: Very well, Doctor, but the explanation had better be
good. <br>
GRIERSON: The lift's started down again, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
MATTHEWS: Mister Benton? <br>
BENTON: Yes? <br>
MATTHEWS: Could you spare a minute, please? <br>
(Benton and Matthews leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: What controls the angle of your radar dish? <br>
GRIERSON: This one here, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Give me a pen.

DOCTOR: Could you do that? <br>
GRIERSON: Well, it's possible. It would take a bit of time, though. I'd
have to re-jig about eleven circuits there. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. Well, you get about it. <br>
GRIERSON: You can't <br>
DOCTOR: Tell no one what you're doing. <br>
GRIERSON: You can't point the radar dishes down here, sir! They'd jam
every radio and electronic equipment for miles. There'd be chaos. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing like the chaos there'll be if you don't do it,
Grierson. <br>
(Faraday and Harry enter.) <br>
FARADAY: Doctor! What the devil's going on? <br>
DOCTOR: An invasion of Earth is going on, Colonel. <br>
FARADAY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go to your office. You've got some important phone calls
to make. Crayford's sold you out to the Kraals. <br>
FARADAY: Kraals? Never heard of them. </font></p>

Doctor? <br>

DOCTOR: They've made replicas of you and Harry, Colonel. <br>
FARADAY: Of me? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
FARADAY: Confounded cheek. How dare they! <br>
HARRY: Colonel, I think I should run a complete medical check on
everyone. <br>
FARADAY: Good idea, Sullivan. That'll nail 'em, eh, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but it would take too long. We can use this. <br>
(The Doctor takes a small thin box with a red light on it out of his
pocket.) <br>
HARRY: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a robot detector. It lights up in the presence of
androids. <br>
(It lights up.) <br>
FARADAY: Thing must be faulty. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so. I see I was just too late. <br>
DOCTOR 2: A pity you had to find out. <br>
(The fake Doctor is in the doorway, pointing a gun at him.) <br>
DOCTOR 2: We didn't want any shooting until our takeover was complete. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Doctor. We've been waiting for you. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Stand back, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, the resemblance is astonishing. For a moment, I
thought I was seeing double. <br>

out of Faraday's window.) </font></p>

(They look round the corner of a building at the rocket sitting high
above them.) <br>

CRAYFORD: What's going on? <br>
DOCTOR 2: The Doctor has interfered in our plans for the last time. <br>
CRAYFORD: But Styggron promised me there would be no killing. <br>
DOCTOR 2: Fool. Do you really think the Kraals will spare humanity?
Styggron has a virus in your ship that will destroy every man, woman
and child in the world. <br>
CRAYFORD: Styggron wouldn't do that. He's a surgeon, a genius. Look
what he did for me! <br>
DOCTOR: He did nothing for you, Crayford. Absolutely nothing at all.
Except brainwash you. <br>
CRAYFORD: That's not true. <br>
DOCTOR: You were hijacked by the Kraals, Crayford. Nothing went wrong
with your rocket, Crayford. You weren't even injured. Take off the eye
patch and look for yourself. <br>
(Crayford walks over to a mirror on the wall. He rips off the eye patch
then storms back to the lift to the rocket. The Doctor kicks the gun
out of the android's hand but gets punched out for his trouble. The
android sounds the alarm.)
