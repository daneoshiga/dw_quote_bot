<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Clara is hanging upside down with a rope around
her ankles, spinning. Missy is sharpening a stick with a knife.) <br>
MISSY: Consider the Doctor. The Doctor, trapped. The Doctor, alone. You
all right there, dear?<br>
CLARA: Where are we? How did we ?<br>
MISSY: Shh, now. Mummy's talking. Okay, I'm going to tell you a story
of the Doctor. It's classic. On the run, no Tardis. No friends, no
help. In other words, the Doctor, happy. It was a long time ago.<br>
(As she tells her tale, we get a brief black and white glimpse of a figure in a long scarf ducking
behind a stone column.) <br>
MISSY: Doesn't matter which face he was wearing, they're all the Doctor
to me. So let's give it to the eyebrows.<br>(The hero of her story is now the current Doctor.)<br>
CLARA: But the Daleks <br>
MISSY: Yes, I'm coming to that.<br>
CLARA: Shouldn't we be, um? I don't want to say dead.<br>
MISSY: Hush! He's travelling by teleporter. Unfortunately, his
teleporter is out of power. Also unfortunate, he's being stalked by,
oh, say about fifty android
assassins? I may be rounding up.<br>
(She checks her sharpened stick.) <br>
MISSY: Ow. Fifty invisible, indestructible android assassins, all
exclusively programmed to kill him.<br>
CLARA: Why are you sharpening that stick?<br>
MISSY: Well, I've no idea how long we're going to be stuck out here.
Might have to go hunting.<br>
CLARA: So why am I tied up?<br>
MISSY: In case there's nothing to hunt.<br>
(Back to the flashes of black and white Doctor being shot at by lasers
and backing down a big stone staircase.) <br>
MISSY: The Doctor, then. Surrounded. Outnumbered. Outgunned. And
freeze. Nanoseconds to live. Four, I'd say, being generous. Now, my
question is this. How did he survive?<br>
(She prods Clara.) <br>
MISSY: Oh, come on, Clara! You know him. Consider the Doctor.<br>(Clara's mind's eye sees the Doctor looking at her.)<br>
CLARA: Where did he get that teleport thingy?<br>
MISSY: Oh, good, good. He stole one from an android.<br>
CLARA: So, I'm guessing he uses the same energy as the android weapons,
right?<br>
MISSY: Excellent! Not seeing you as sandwiches now.
<br>CLARA: Okay, then. He uses the energy wave from the android weapons to
recharge the teleport bracelet and at the exact moment he's supposed to
disintegrate,<br>
(The Doctor raises his hands over his head, pointing the sonic screwdriver at the teleporter - just like that
poster for Star Wars, A New Hope - to absorb the laser energy and -.) <br>
CLARA: He actually teleports. Hang on, that's how you did it. That's
how we escaped the Daleks.<br>
MISSY: I modified the same principle for our vortex manipulators, yes.
Blew them off, I'm afraid. But the Doctor, he, he improvised it. He
must have got through several thousand calculations in the time it
takes to fire up a disintegrator. Seriously, what a swot!<br>
CLARA: So the androids think he's dead and the Doctor escapes.<br>
(The Doctor falls down a hole.)
<br>MISSY: No, he's the Doctor. He fell into a nest of vampire monkeys.<br>(The green eyes of the screeching monkeys glow in the light of the screwdriver.)<br>
MISSY: But that's another story!<br>
(She lets Clara down very suddenly.)
<br>CLARA: Oh!<br>
MISSY: Why does the Doctor always survive?<br>
CLARA: Because he's clever.<br>
MISSY: Yes, but there's lots of clever dead people. I love killing
clever clogs, they make the best faces.<br>
CLARA: Because he always assumes he's going to win. He always knows
there's a way to survive. He just has to go and find it.<br>
MISSY: Yes, except this time, he made a will and threw himself a
goodbye party. Now, if the Doctor assumes he's going to die, what
happens then?<br>
CLARA: We do.<br>
MISSY: He's trapped at the heart of the Dalek empire. He's a prisoner
of the creatures who hate him most in the universe. Between us and him
is everything the deadliest race in all of history can throw at us. We,
on the other hand, have a pointy stick. How do we start?<br>
CLARA: We assume we're going to win.<br>
MISSY: Oh. Pity, really. I was actually quite peckish.<br>
(Missy starts to walk off across the desert.) <br>
CLARA: Can I have a stick too?<br>
MISSY: Make your own stick.

Answer? I'm the Doctor. Just accept it.<br>

survived among several billion trigger-happy mini-tanks for centuries.

MISSY: In future, if you're going to take my stick, do me the courtesy
of actually killing me. Team work is all about respect.<br>
CLARA: We're not a team.
<br>MISSY: Of course we are. Every miner needs a canary. Now, hush, look
around. Bit of a mess, isn't it?<br>
CLARA: You said it was a sewer.<br>
MISSY: Daleks don't generate much in the way of waste.<br>
CLARA: So what is it all, then?<br>
MISSY: Decaying Daleks. Daleks can't die. Genetically hard-wired to
keep on living, whatever happens. Well. But they still age, poor loves.
Over time, the body breaks down, rots, liquefies. Interestingly, the
Dalek word for sewer is the same as their word for graveyard.<br>

DALEK SUPREME: Your associate <br>DOCTOR: I saw what happened. I was there.
And I'm hoping, for all of our sakes, that it was a trick.<br>

eliminate. And now he sees it. Now he understands. The cables, Doctor.
Touch them. Imagine, to hold in your hand the heartbeat of every Dalek
on Skaro. They send me life. Is it beyond the wit of a Time Lord to
send them death? A little work and it could be done.<br>

as a simple act of war. Genocide as a choice. Are you ready, Doctor? So

brought you here.<br>

telling stories. And I didn't come here because I'm ashamed. A bit of
shame never hurt anyone. I came because you're sick and you asked. And
because sometimes, on a good day, if I try very hard, I'm not some old
Time Lord who ran away. I'm the Doctor.<br>

MISSY: Cybermen suppress emotion. Daleks channel it through a gun.
That's why they keep yelling exterminate. It's how they reload. So,
let's go and kill them. Come on.

longed to ask.<br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, if you're going to put your hand on my knee, it
isn't going to go well.<br>
DAVROS: Why did you leave Gallifrey?<br>
DOCTOR: Well, because I did.<br>
DAVROS: You stole the Tardis, and ran and ran. Why?<br>
DOCTOR: It's a boring place, Gallifrey. I was going out of my mind.<br>
DAVROS: Yet you long to return.<br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, I'm inconsistent.<br>
DAVROS: But it is always the same lie.<br>
DOCTOR: What lie?<br>
DAVROS: You weren't bored. No one runs the way you have run for so
small a reason.<br>
DOCTOR: I do. <br>DAVROS: No, you don't. Colony Sarff confiscated these items on your
arrival.<br></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Davros goes to a box on a small table.)</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <br>DAVROS: A Time Lord confession dial, I believe. Your confession. Tell
me. Send me to my grave with this precious knowledge. What <em>is</em>
the Doctor's confession?<br>
(Davros reaches for the dial.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you dare!<br>
DAVROS: Is it possible I have touched a nerve?<br>
DOCTOR: Some things matter to me, Davros. Not many, but a few. And you
don't put your fingers anywhere near them.<br>
(The Doctor retrieves his sunglasses from the box.) <br>
DOCTOR: And they'd better not be scratched. These are my best ones.<br>
DAVROS: Still you play the fool.<br>

Explain! <br>
MISSY: I'm a prisoner of special significance. Count the hearts.<br>
DALEK: You are a Time Lord?<br>

still the same old Supreme Dalek these days? I fought him once on the

did you really leave Gallifrey?<br>
DOCTOR: How long has it been, you and I?<br>
DAVROS: Long enough. Galaxies have burned.<br>
DOCTOR: And now you ask me a personal question?<br>
DAVROS: You have slaughtered billions of my children, as I have
slaughtered billions of your race. We have exhausted the conventional
means of communication. <br>(The Doctor removes his sunglasses.)<br>
DOCTOR: My people are alive. They didn't die. I brought them back. I
found a way.<br>
DAVROS: Is this true?<br>
DOCTOR: Gallifrey is back in the sky. I don't know where, I may never
know. But Gallifrey is back and it is safe from both of us.<br>
DAVROS: Doctor, my most sincere congratulations.<br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?<br>
DAVROS: This is wonderful news. Beyond all hope. I congratulate you.<br>
DOCTOR: Why are you saying that?<br>
DAVROS: A man should have a race, a people, an allegiance. A man should
belong, Doctor. Believe me, please. I am happy for you. So happy.<br>
DOCTOR: I don't, I don't understand this. Why are you <br>(The Doctor is speechless.)<br>
DAVROS: Come closer again. Let me see your face.<br>
DOCTOR: You've seen it often enough.<br>
DAVROS: Let me see it again with my own eyes.<br>
(The blue light in his forehead goes out. The Doctor leans forward as
Davros opens his rheumy eyes.)<br>
DAVROS: Closer, please. <br>(Their eyes meet.)<br>DAVROS: If you have redeemed the Time Lords from the
fire, do not lose them again. Take the darkest path into the deepest
hell, but protect your own as I have sought to protect mine. Did I do
right, Doctor? Tell me. <br>(Davros puts his hand on the Doctor's.)<br>DAVROS: Was I right? I need to know before the end. Am
I a good man?<br>
DOCTOR: You really are dying, aren't you?<br>
DAVROS: Look at me. Did you doubt it?<br>
DOCTOR: Yes.<br>
DAVROS: Then we have established one thing only.<br>
DOCTOR: What?<br>
DAVROS: You are not a good doctor.<br>
(They both chuckle, then Davros struggles to breathe.) <br>
DAVROS: Pity. I had hoped to see the sun one last time with the eyes of
my true self.

my secret favourite. Don't tell the others.<br>

DALEK SUPREME: You are an enemy of the Daleks.<br>
MISSY: Yes, well, anyone who's not a Dalek is an enemy of the Daleks,
so that was an easy guess.<br>
DALEK SUPREME: You will be exterminated.<br>
MISSY: Please, please do, because I have been on my feet all day. <br>(She stands again.)<br>MISSY: But
before you get all exterminate-y, two things. One, I want to see
Davros. Two, I have a lovely little gift for you all, if you take me to

DAVROS: It is beautiful, my world, is it not?<br>
DOCTOR: How did you get it back?<br>
DAVROS: The Daleks remade it. Like you, they have a strong concept of
home.<br>
DOCTOR: No, like you. Everything you are, they are.<br>
(The Doctor is plugging Davros back into the life support cables.) <br>
DAVROS: Like both of us, perhaps. How far we have come to go home again.<br>
DOCTOR: I'm trying to pep this up, but you've been going a long time.
Every Dalek on Skaro isn't enough any more.<br>
DAVROS: It is so good of you to help me.<br>
DOCTOR: I'm not helping you. I'm helping a little boy I abandoned on a
battlefield. I think I owe him a sunrise.<br>

DAVROS: I regret I cannot open my eyes.<br>
(Davros is crying.)<br>
DOCTOR: Okay, don't ever tell anyone that I did this.<br>
(He waves his hand around until a golden glow forms.) <br>
DOCTOR: A little bit of regeneration energy. Probably cost me an arm or
a leg somewhere down the line. Or I'll just be really little.<br>
(The Doctor stands in the middle of the cables where Davros used to be.
Davros chuckles to himself as the Doctor takes hold of a cable with his
glowing hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Should be enough, just to <br>

DAVROS: Hold him firm, Colony Sarff. He is precious to us now.<br>
(The Doctor is on his knees with pain as regeneration energy flows though the cables to Davros..)<br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing?<br>
DAVROS: Regeneration energy. The ancient magic of the Time Lords. I
thought I would have to tear you apart to take it from you but, as
always, your compassion is your downfall.<br>

DOCTOR: No! No! No, please! No!<br>
DAVROS: You have opened your veins of your own free will, and all
Daleks shall drink the blood of Gallifrey. They shall rise stronger
than ever.<br>
