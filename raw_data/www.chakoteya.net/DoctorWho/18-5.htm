hairy bipeds lying on tiers of cots around the room. We move out into a
corridor.) <br>

(Past control panels on metal walls and graffiti on another - Kilroy
was here - and - Aldo - scrawled in red.) <br>
SAGAN [OC]: Sixty. Fifty. Forty. <br>
(More graffiti from Kilroy. We come to an area where a man in an orange
jumpsuit is lounging on a chair holding a hand of cards. His companion
is listening to the countdown.) <br>
SAGAN [OC]: Thirty, twenty nine, twenty eight, twenty seven, twenty

RORVIK: Hit it! Hit it! <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to Kenneth Cope, sounding petulant as ever.) <br>
PACKARD: How can I hit it? He's still not visualising. <br>
RORVIK: Well, jump them. <br>
PACKARD: What, the timelines? You can't do it blind. <br>
RORVIK: I'll say what we can and can't do. Oh, anything's better than
staying here. Ignition! <br>
(Rorvik hits a control on Packard's console. The whole place flickers
sideways.) <br>
SAGAN: We have lift off. <br>
(The two men playing cards cheer. Rorvik goes over to the hairy
creature.) <br>
RORVIK: Now we'll have to see, Biroc. Show us where we're going. <br>
(The monitor above Biroc stays blank.) <br>
RORVIK: Right. High-tension cable. We'll run it to his feed point. That
ought to boost him. <br>
PACKARD: Kill him, more like. <br>
RORVIK: Always looking on the gloomy side, Packard. <br>
(The card players pass comment.) <br>
ALDO: He'll kill him. <br>
(His companion produces a large coin.) <br>
ROYCE: You want to bet? <br>
RORVIK: Connect the cable and switch on. (Biroc stiffens.) <br>
SAGAN: We're closing on something. <br>
ALDO: All right, it's fifty fifty. Okay. <br>
(Aldo flips his own coin.) <br>
PACKARD: He's right! We're heading for a time rift! <br>
(The picture stutters. Packard flails about and grabs a rail to stop
himself falling over. The coin stops in mid air. Then consoles explode
and the coin lands. A vague image of the Tardis appears on the monitor
above Biroc's head.)

DOCTOR: Haven't you done enough damage already? <br>
ROMANA: It's not me, it's a time rift. She won't respond to the
coordinates. <br>
DOCTOR: Here, let me have a try. Just needs a little friendly
persuasion, that's all.&nbsp;<br>
ROMANA: I have been friendly! <br>
DOCTOR: Probably too friendly. I said a little friendly. Firm but
friendly. Watch. <br>
The juddering stops.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. <br>
(And starts again.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's jammed. I've lost control. We're adrift in E-space. <br>
ROMANA: Come on, Doctor. We've got to do something. <br>
DOCTOR: Have we? <br>
ROMANA: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe that's it. <br>
ROMANA: What, drifting?&nbsp;<br>

few buttons.) <br>
SAGAN: Helm readings show no space, no time, just like before. <br>
RORVIK: Damn you, Biroc. Right back where we started. Stuck in this
nothing for months and months and now this. <br>
PACKARD: We've got damage! <br>
RORVIK: Well, of course we've got damage! How bad? <br>
SAGAN: Lane's taking a look. <br>
LANE [OC]: Lane to Bridge. <br>
PACKARD: What's the news? <br>
LANE [OC]: The outer shell's torn. A rip you can climb right through.
In fact, I just did. <br>
PACKARD: Never mind the frills. What about the hull? <br>
LANE [OC]: I'm checking that. Nothing structural that I can see.

give me a proper report. Lane! <br>
PACKARD: What about the warp drive? <br>
RORVIK: Packard's worried about the warp drive. <br>
LANE [OC]: If this power line goes up, there won't be any warp drive.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROMANA: Go on, then, admit it. You don't know what
your doing. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just following intuition. <br>
ROMANA: It's no better than tossing a coin. <br>
DOCTOR: What's so improbable about tossing a coin? Never heard of the
I-Ching? <br>
ROMANA: Superstition. <br>
DOCTOR: Random samplings that affect the broad flow of the material
universe. <br>
(Adric takes a coin out of his trouser pocket.) <br>
ROMANA: The holistic view? <br>
DOCTOR: The holistic view. <br>
ROMANA: Huh. Astral Jung. <br>
ADRIC: What's the I-Ching? <br>
K9: Ancient Chinese book of philosophy accessed by random sampling. <br>
ADRIC: So how does that work then? <br>
K9: One traditional method is tossing of coins. The I-Ching methodology
casts doubt on the value of normal causalistic procedures. <br>
(Adric tosses his coin, catches it and puts it on the back of his
hand.) <br>
K9: And, of course, vice versa.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LANE [OC]: You were asking about the warp drive? <br>
PACKARD: Yes? <br>
LANE [OC]: Don't ask. It's shot to hell. <br>
RORVIK: Okay, Lane. Back in here. <br>
(Static crackles.) <br>
RORVIK: Lane? <br>
PACKARD: Lane? Lane? Lane! Huh! Communications are breaking up now! <br>
RORVIK: What about you, Biroc? Are you breaking up? Why no pictures? <br>
ALDO: He's going. <br>
RORVIK: You blew out my warp drive. You did that on purpose. <br>
ROYCE: What a waste. I wouldn't get much for his scrap value. <br>
PACKARD: We've got to get him patched up. We'll lose him. <br>
RORVIK: Typical Packard. Always thinking of your bonus. <br>
(Rorvik stops Packard unfastening Biroc and sends him back to his
console.) <br>
RORVIK: Sagan, Kilroy. Take him below and get him fixed up. <br>
(Sagan nudges Kilroy to wake him, and they obey. <br>
ALDO: We're back in nowhere. <br>
ROYCE: Well, nowhere's somewhere. <br>
ALDO: Somewhere that's not even suppose to exist. <br>
RORVIK: Report from the helm. That's you, remember? Instrumentation
status. <br>
PACKARD: What do you want me to say? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sagan and Kilroy are half-carrying Biroc through
the corridor when he opens his eyes. He puts his feet down and pushes
them to the floor, then goes down a flight of steps to a locked door.
He opens the keypad as Lane enters from another door with his smoking
kerchief. They meet in the middle, stare at each other then Biroc leave
through the door Lane came in by. Lane gets out his pocket
communicator.) <br>
RORVIK [OC]: Bridge, yes? Lane, is that you? What is it, man? <br>

DOCTOR: It's always darkest before the storm. <br>
ROMANA: Dawn. <br>
DOCTOR: Dawn. Isn't that right, K9? <br>
ROMANA: According to your theory, we just press any button and hope for
the best. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well that might help. <br>
ROMANA: But not that button! <br>
DOCTOR: You didn't really think I'd activate the Reverse Bias, did you?
Huh. It's extremely difficult to generate non-determinate action. I
mean, ha. Maybe, subconsciously, I wanted to press that button. <br>
ROMANA: In full flight? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. In full flight. <br>
ROMANA: Ahem, Doctor, can I have a word with you? <br>
(Romana drags the Doctor away from the console to the coat stand.) <br>
ROMANA: Have you got a death wish? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. Don't you want to get back to Gallifrey? <br>
ROMANA: You know I don't want to get back to Gallifrey. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we'll burn that bridge when we come to it. It's all
academic unless we find the CVE. <br>
ROMANA: What about Adric? <br>
DOCTOR: What about Adric? <br>
ROMANA: Well, if we get out of E-Space, we'll be taking him away from
his own universe. <br>
DOCTOR: So? <br>
ROMANA: Do we have that right? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll love it on Gallifrey. <br>
(Adric goes to the console, flips his coin and presses a button.
Normality resumes. <br>
K9: Hexagram nine. Hsiao Ch'u. The taming power of the small. Quote, if
you are sincere, blood vanishes and fear gives way. <br>
(Biroc runs through a white void.) <br>
DOCTOR: What have you just done? What's he just done, K9? K9:
Nondeterminate activity in accordance with the theory you were
offering, master. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's perfectly all right then. <br>
(Then everyone gets thrown to the floor. The Tardis doors open onto the
white void.) <br>
DOCTOR: You all right, Romana? <br>
ROMANA: I'm fine. <br>
DOCTOR: Adric? <br>
ADRIC: I think so. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
(The light from the void makes parts of the console explode. The Doctor
snatches back his hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Time winds! <br>
(K9 begins to smoke. The Doctor wraps his scarf around his hand to push
him out of harms way, then Biroc enters and puts his hands on the
console.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RORVIK: So now we've got a busted warp motor and
no navigator. Nowhere to go and no way of getting there. Yes? Any views
on that? <br>
SAGAN: Wait a minute! <br>
(The Tardis is on his monitor.) <br>
RORVIK: A minute. We've got all eternity. <br>
SAGAN: I'm getting something on the short range scanner. <br>
RORVIK: What is it? <br>
SAGAN: I don't know, but it's solid and it's moving. <br>
PACKARD: I've got it over here, too. It looks as if we've got company. <br>
SAGAN: They're coming in to land.

jumpy as he operates the console.) <br>
ROMANA: He's out of phase. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. That's how he got in. He's on a different timeline. <br>
ROMANA: But he should be torn apart. <br>
(Biroc finishes his work.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Lane has returned to the bridge.) <br>
PACKARD: They might have someone who can fix the warp motor. <br>
RORVIK: So why are they caught between the timelines like us? <br>
PACKARD: Well, we won't know that until we find out, will we? <br>
RORVIK: And we still need Biroc back, or we'll have to get one of the
other ones out of storage. <br>
PACKARD: You can't revive any of them out here. You need the full
apparatus. <br>
RORVIK: Oh, we can jury rig something if necessary. So some of them may
die. And that cuts into everybody's profits, a chunk out of everybody's
bonus. If you want to complain, bring it to Mister Sagan here, because
he's the one who managed to lose your navigator for you. We're going
out to that ship. <br>
LANE: How will I find it? <br>
PACKARD: Portable Mass Detector. Aldo, Royce! Break it out from the
stores, will you. <br>
(The card players below sigh and get up.) <br>
ROYCE: Let's have the keys then. <br>
ALDO: I gave them to you. <br>
(Aldo unzips Royce's breast pocket and holds up the keys.) <br>
ROYCE: It's non-stop, Aldo. Non-stop. <br>
RORVIK: You'll be leading the way. <br>
LANE: Why me? <br>
RORVIK: In case they're hostile. <br>
(The implications take a few moments to sink in.)

ROMANA: Can he see us? <br>
DOCTOR: About the same way as we can see him. <br>
ROMANA: Who are you? <br>
(Biroc's voice comes from a long way away.) <br>
BIROC: I am Biroc. Others follow. <br>
DOCTOR: Others? <br>
BIROC: Believe nothing they say. They are not Biroc's kind. <br>
ROMANA: But what are you? <br>
BIROC: The shadow of my past and of your future. <br>
(Biroc leaves the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: The shadow of his past <br>
ROMANA: And of our future. <br>
(The doors close behind Biroc and he runs back through the void.) <br>
DOCTOR: Romana, check those coordinates. <br>
ROMANA: They're all locked off at zero. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Now listen, you two stay here and hold the fort. I'm going
to follow Biroc. Come on K9. K9? Come on. He wasn't built to withstand
this type of punishment. Come on now, come on. <br>
ADRIC: Maybe it was the time winds. <br>
(The Doctor sighs and rests his head against K9's. There is a little
beep.) <br>
DOCTOR: He's still alive! <br>
ROMANA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
ROMANA: Zero coordinates. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Ponder on that. <br>
(The Doctor leaves the Tardis.) <br>
ADRIC: Ponder on what? <br>
ROMANA: Don't you see? Our N-space is positive and your E-space is
negative. <br>
ADRIC: I see. Then this must be the intersection. Well, somewhere near
the intersection. <br>
ROMANA: If the Doctor can find it. <br>
(A little later, Romana has got her toolbox and is working on K9.) <br>
ADRIC: You're sure you can repair him? What's N-space like? <br>
ROMANA: I've just told you, Adric. It's positive. <br>
ADRIC: Hmm. Well, I must say I'm quite looking forward to going there
with you and the Doctor. <br>
ROMANA: What if The Doctor and I went different ways? <br>
ADRIC: But you wouldn't, would you. <br>
ROMANA: Now, these are parts of his oops! <br>
(The component crumbles to dust in her hand.) <br>
ROMANA: Memory. How are you feeling, K9? <br>
K9: Misconception of the functional nature of this unit. I neither feel
nor find it necessary to express states of efficiency or dysfunction. <br>
ADRIC: Does that mean he feels all right? <br>
ROMANA: I'll have to check. <br>
K9: All systems functioning. Recommend priority transferred to the
three humanoid life forms approaching the Tardis. <br>
ADRIC: What? He's having delusions! <br>
(Rorvik, Packard and Lane walk through the void. The Portable Mass
Detector is a chest-sized box strapped to Lane. The beeping speeds up. <br>
(Meanwhile, Romana enters from the interior with an armful of boxes.) <br>
ROMANA: These stores really are the limit. Nothing's catalogued. Half
the shelves are empty. This was all I could find. Adric? Adric. <br>
(Adric is looking at the scanner, so Romana does too and sees the three
men approaching.) <br>
ROMANA: But that's impossible. The coordinates are at zero. <br>
K9: Probability computes at zero point zero zero zero five seven,
mistress. Please apply point six seven error correction to this
estimate. Error in error correction estimate estimated at point three
seven zero five. <br>
ROMANA: We should do something. He'll go like this forever. <br>
(Romana pulls a wire in his back.) <br>
K9: Correction. All present and correct. King's Regulations brackets
Army close brackets report of the orderly sergeant to the officer of
the day. Default is martial <br>
(K9 runs out of power and stops.) <br>
ROMANA: It's all going to be all right, K9. <br>
ADRIC: They've got guns! Oh, I wish the Doctor were here. <br>
ROMANA: So do I. Oh, never mind. It's all going to be fine. I'm fully
qualified. Bring me a box. <br>
(Adric tips a load of junk out of a box. <br>
Boric has reached a lovely gothic stone doorway with solid oak doors,
but most of the rest of the building is missing. He pushes them open
and enters a blackness. After a little hesitation, the Doctor follows
him. <br>
Boric burst through another door into a Great Hall, full of cobwebs
hanging from a chandelier over the table set for six, and a two suits
of armour by a pillar. There is one person at the table, presumably
long dead. Boric walks forward and disappears through a mirror between
two pillars.)

taps the trestle table. He goes to the suits of armour, straightens the
pike and helmet of one of them and taps the other on the breast plate,

has found Biroc's manacles on the floor by the mirror. The suit raises
its battle axe to strike.) </font></p>

work out where he has gone. The Doctor has joined two other suits and

smashes the pike with his axe.) <br>

ROMANA: Would that be a sort of leonine mesomorph, with a lot of hair? <br>
PACKARD: Yeah, that's him. Our navigator. <br>
RORVIK: Have you seen him? <br>

connected to the time lines. <br>
RORVIK: What do you know about the time lines? <br>
ROMANA: My ship travels through them. So does yours. <br>
PACKARD: How do you know that? <br>

ADRIC: We're outside. <br>
ROMANA: Pity. I want to be on the inside. <br>
ADRIC: But I've just rescued you. <br>
ROMANA: Thank you, but I have got to find out what they're up to in
there. Do you know what a Tharil is? <br>
ADRIC: No. <br>
ROMANA: Well, there's one loose on this ship and they're all terrified
of it. It's like Biroc, but horribly burnt. <br>
ADRIC: Where's the Doctor? <br>
ROMANA: I have seen him. <br>
ADRIC: What is it? <br>
ROMANA: I'm not sure. That machine they put me into. It projected an
image, a gateway. The Doctor might be there. <br>
(The spaceship door opens again and they get back under the sheet. A
man walks past and they get out again.) <br>
ROMANA: Come on, let's follow him. Follow. <br>
(The man was Lane, and there is a big hole in the side of the spaceship
where Adric and Romana can watch him.) <br>
ROMANA: So it wasn't just a trick. There really is warp damage. <br>
(Lane uses his communicator.) <br>
LANE: No chance of taking off with the motors in this state. Should be
good for a back blast, though. </font></p>

ROMANA: You won't get the Doctor's help by pointing guns at him. <br>
RORVIK: I negotiate from strength. <br>

the Tharils can enter your universe that way and that's a talent

RORVIK: Is that yours? <br>
K9: Mass conversion anomaly. Alert. Danger. Warning. <br>
RORVIK: Oh, shut him up. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't say that! He may have a point. What mass conversion
anomaly? <br>
K9: Dimensional contraction of the microcosmic system. Orders. <br>
DOCTOR: Contraction? This could be serious. <br>
ROMANA: It's the memory wafers, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROMANA: He's going a bit funny. <br>
K9: Mathematical vanishing imminent. Warning. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's not funny. That's. What's causing it? <br>
K9: Impossible to compute. Space time instability. <br>
RORVIK: Time to play with your toys later, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I think not! If K9's right, and he usually is, this place is in
worse shape than we thought it was. <br>
PACKARD: You can't get worse than the back of beyond. <br>
DOCTOR: Soon it may not even be that. <br>
ROMANA: K9 says its dimensions are contracting. <br>
RORVIK: Well, that's the silliest thing I've heard all day. Who's going
to believe that? <br>
PACKARD: Well <br>
RORVIK: I thought you might. It's ridiculous. Space contracting? <br>
ROMANA: And time. <br>
PACKARD: At least hear him out. What's the hurry? <br>
DOCTOR: Quite a lot. How long have we got, K9? <br>
K9: Contraction curve exponential. Estimate on present data beyond
capability of this unit. <br>
ROMANA: So it's starting? <br>
DOCTOR: Slowly. <br>
ROMANA: But might collapse completely at any minute. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, but it would need a huge mass to disturb time and
space to that extent. Even the Tardis doesn't weigh that much. Neither
does their ship. <br>
ROMANA: It might. The hull is made of dwarf star alloy. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROMANA: Dwarf star alloy. <br>
DOCTOR: Dwarf star alloy? What are you playing at? Is it something to
do with these? <br>
(The Doctor holds up Biroc's manacles.) <br>
ROMANA: They're slavers. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Trading in time sensitives. And dwarf star alloy is the
only material that will hold them. <br>
RORVIK: And it's very expensive. <br>
DOCTOR: How many more of those poor creatures have you got in that hulk
of yours? <br>
RORVIK: Poor creatures? Each one's worth a king's ransom, Doctor. You
seem to understand business even less than you understand science. This
wild theory about contraction. <br>
DOCTOR: No wild theory about contraction. K9. No, K9. K9! <br>
(K9 is at the mirror. The Doctor rushes to him.) <br>
RORVIK: Hold it. <br>
(K9 speaks backwards.) <br>
RORVIK: Your machine seems to know as much about it as you do. Get up! <br>
PACKARD: So what you're saying is, the distances are getting shorter. <br>
LANE: Like between the ship and here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. As the domain contracts. <br>
RORVIK: Shut up! He's playing for time. <br>
DOCTOR: Playing for time? Quite the reverse. <br>
LANE: He's right about one thing. The trip between here and the ship.
Each time we've done it, it has been shorter. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and if I can get back to my Tardis, I can prove it and
find out exactly how much time we have left. <br>
RORVIK: Oh, gobbledygook. We can deal with this in very short order.
Get us through. Time's run out for you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Biroc. <br>
(Biroc is on the other side of the mirror. Time stops as they have
their conversation.) <br>
BIROC: Doctor. You've seen our past, you've seen our present. You were
right. We abused our power. But judge whether we've not suffered
enough. <br>
DOCTOR: As you said, the weak enslave themselves. <br>
BIROC: The time of our enslavement is over. We will be free. <br>
DOCTOR: I wish you luck. But what about us? Have you got any ideas on
that count? <br>
BIROC: Do nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
BIROC: It is done. <br>

ADRIC: Please! Please! Just let the Doctor go. I don't know what these

the rest. Lizards when there's a man's work to be done. I'm sick of
your kind. Faint-hearted, do-nothing, lily-livered deadweights. This is
the end for all of you! I'm finally getting something done!
Bwahahahaha! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cargo hold]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sagan rolls his latest failure off the gurney.
Then Lazlo enters.) <br>
SAGAN: Here, where did you spring from? I haven't done you. Never mind,
you're just what we need. <br>
(Sagan pulls his blaster, but Lazlo easily overpowers him and brings an
exposed piece of cable towards his chest.) <br>
SAGAN: Just a minute! Argh! <br>
(Lazlo goes to the nearest Tharil and holds his paw out over his
forehead. The Tharil wakes. He repeats the operation.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: We've made it. Quick, quick, inside.
What's the matter? <br>
ROMANA: I'm not coming with you. <br>
DOCTOR: Inside. That's an order. <br>
ROMANA: No more orders, Doctor. Goodbye. <br>
DOCTOR: What? What a moment to choose. <br>
ROMANA: But it is, isn't it? A moment to choose. I've got to be my own
Romana. <br>
BIROC: And we need a Time Lord. <br>
ROMANA: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Wait, wait. There's something else. K9. He'll be
all right with you behind the mirrors. <br>
ROMANA: I'll take care of him. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll miss you. You were the noblest Romana of them all. <br>
(The Doctor enters the Tardis. Romana carries K9 away, with Biroc. They
return to the gate and go through the mirror. The Tardis
dematerialises, glowing red in the building back blast from the
spaceship. <br>
The gate explodes, then the spaceship goes boom and bursts into
flames.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Monochrome land]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis briefly appears in mid air by Powis
Castle. Romana, Biroc and K9 watch from the terraced gardens.) <br>
ROMANA: The Tardis. Gone. <br>
K9: Tardis preserved in concept, mistress. This unit contains all
necessary schedules for duplication of the Tardis, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: Exactly, K9. Biroc will help us use the gateway to travel
anywhere in E-space, and we can give him time technology. <br>
BIROC: You shall be our Time Lord, and we will travel far. Our people
are enslaved on many planets. <br>
ROMANA: And you and I, K9, are going to Biroc free them. That's
something we've got to do, don't you think? <br>
K9: Affirmative, mistress. <br>
(Time-shifted images of Tharils leave the smoking remains of the
spaceship and enter the gateway.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ADRIC: The picture's fading. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ADRIC: It's gone. Nothing there. <br>
DOCTOR: So it has. Nothing. Well, that's something. <br>
ADRIC: How can nothing be something? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if the E-space image translator doesn't work, I'm hoping
we're in N-space. <br>
ADRIC: Back in your own universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ADRIC: Can you be sure? <br>
DOCTOR: Did I say sure? <br>
ADRIC: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. One solid hope's worth a cartload of certainties. <br>
ADRIC: Will Romana be all right? <br>
DOCTOR: All right? She'll be superb. </font> </p>
