uniform goes to a younger man in mostly red.) <br>

must remain undetected until we are ready to act. </font></p>

KARINA: It seems to be organic in structure, and radiating heat. <br>
(Another woman, in mostly brown, speaks.) <br>
PRESTON: Check. <br>
VORSHAK: Volcanic debris? <br>

last adventure. Turlough enters from the interior.) <br>
TURLOUGH: How are we doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, on target, it seems. You changed your mind about going
home. <br>
TURLOUGH: Well, I, er, I thought I would learn more if I stayed with
you. It's true. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. <br>
TURLOUGH: I mean it. <br>
DOCTOR: I believe you. I'm just a little doubtful about how resolute
you'll remain. <br>
TURLOUGH: Time will tell. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. Aboard the Tardis it always does. <br>
TURLOUGH: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: Earth. <br>
TURLOUGH: What for? <br>
DOCTOR: I promised to show Tegan a little of her planet's future. We're
almost there. You could let her know. <br>

flicks switches, concerned.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VORSHAK: Nothing. What's the matter? <br>
BULIC: I think we should launch a reconnaissance probe. <br>
VORSHAK: Forever cautious. <br>
BULIC: I've spent too long on a Sea Base not to be. And given how
unstable the current political situation is, an attack is not to be
unexpected. <br>
VORSHAK: Launch an unmanned probe. <br>
KARINA: Sir. <br>
VORSHAK: Happier? <br>
BULIC: Thank you, sir. <br>
VORSHAK: The base is to remain on full alert, and Maddox? <br>
MADDOX: Sir? <br>
VORSHAK: If there is enemy activity outside, we could go to missile
run, so stand by. <br>
(The young man looks very worried.) <br>
MADDOX: Yes, sir. <br>

compartment.) </font></p>

ICHTAR: The Myrka can deal with it. <br>
TARPOK: We are ready to begin, Ichtar. <br>
ICHTAR: Good. For hundreds of years our Sea Devil brothers have lain
entombed, waiting patiently for this day. It concerns me that they did
not wake up as we had planned in the first place. <br>
(Ichtar and Tarpok walk slowly through a rock-cut passageway.) <br>
ICHTAR: Their enforced period of hibernation may have caused much
muscular and organic degeneration. We shall soon see, Tarpok. Proceed. <br>
(Tarpok presses some squidgy buttons, and through a glass window we see
the liquid level dropping in a large area.) </font></p>

KARINA: What's the matter? <br>
MADDOX: I can't do it. <br>
KARINA: Of course you can. <br>
MADDOX: You saw me out there. <br>
KARINA: You wouldn't be here if there was any doubt about your fitness
for the job. <br>
MADDOX: I'm a student on attachment to Sea Base Four to study an
experienced sync operator in action, not to take his place. I'm not
ready. <br>
KARINA: Until Lieutenant Michaels' replacement arrives, there isn't
anyone else. <br>
MADDOX: I know. I'd feel much happier if there'd been a proper
investigation into the Lieutenant's death. <br>
KARINA: It was a careless accident. There was nothing to investigate. <br>
MADDOX: Lieutenant Michaels was careful to the point of paranoia. Men
like that aren't electrocuted carrying out simple maintenance. <br>
KARINA: You reported your suspicion? <br>
MADDOX: Of course, but Commander Vorshak's not interested. He just
keeps going on about what a marvellous opportunity this is for me to
gain hard experience. <br>
KARINA: The Commander's right. <br>
MADDOX: Maybe he is, but I'm also aware that if we so go to missile
alert I don't think I can press that button. <br>
KARINA: Listen to me. Don't throw your whole career away because you
don't feel quite ready. That's silly. Lieutenant Michaels' replacement
arrives the day after tomorrow. There may not be a missile run before
then anyway. <br>
MADDOX: All right. <br>
KARINA: Come back to the bridge? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TURLOUGH: Now what? <br>
DOCTOR: It's my own fault. I should, er, I should have changed it for a
Type 57 while I had the chance. <br>
TEGAN: We're where we should be, aren't we? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Very close to Earth, in orbit above the atmosphere
belt. <br>
TEGAN: So what's the problem? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, slight hiccup in our time zones. We're too far advanced.
I'm sorry. <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor, look. <br>
(The scanner shows five bright dots flying in formation. They resolve
themselves into a single object.) <br>
TEGAN: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a robot weapons system. It seems to be scanning us. <br>
SENTINEL [OC]: This is Sentinel Six. You have entered a forbidden
military zone. Transmit your security clearance code. <br>
DOCTOR: Reset the coil cut-out. <br>
(Turlough obeys.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sentinel Six, could you repeat your instructions, please. <br>
SENTINEL [OC]: This is Sentinel Six. You have entered a forbidden
military zone. Transmit your security clearance code or you will be
destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: Sentinel Six, we have no hostile intentions. Our presence here
is purely temporary. All we need is a bit of time to alter coordinates.
<br>
TEGAN: Why doesn't it answer? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's obviously thinking it over. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A woman doctor in white is checking a computer
bank when Nilson enters, carrying a blue case.) <br>
NILSON: It's time to move, Solow. We've got our man. <br>
SOLOW: Maddox? <br>
NILSON: Yes, you were right. He is psychologically unsuited for his
work. <br>
SOLOW: I'm glad to hear it. I must admit I was a little concerned
lately that my diagnosis was inaccurate. <br>
NILSON: No, you can congratulate yourself and stop worrying. The sudden
demise of Lieutenant Michaels has paid us an immediate dividend. <br>
SOLOW: You're a hard man, Nilson, but you forget, I'm a doctor. Murder
does not come easily to a person of my training. <br>
NILSON: Don't bleat, Solow. We've waited long enough for an opportunity
like this. <br>
SOLOW: I realise that. <br>
NILSON: And nothing must go wrong. So if your conscience bothers you,
lock it away in a strong box until our task is completed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The image of Sentinel Six fills the scanner.) <br>
TEGAN: Please hurry, Doctor. That thing isn't going to lie there
contemplating its navel forever. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't panic, Tegan. Now look, just push this. Almost there. <br>
SENTINEL [OC]: This is Sentinel Six. You are formally identified as a
hostile intruder. <br>
DOCTOR: Sentinel Six, we are unarmed. <br>
SENTINEL [OC]: Repeat. Transmit your security clearance codes. This is
your final warning. <br>
DOCTOR: Sentinel Six, we need just a little more time then we will be
on our way. <br>
TEGAN: Doctor, look! <br>
(Sentinel Six fires on the Tardis. It lurches and the light goes red.) <br>
DOCTOR: We're out of control. <br>
TURLOUGH: We're going to crash! <br>
DOCTOR: Not if I can perform a materialisation flip flop. <br>

VORSHAK: What is it? <br>
KARINA: The reconnaissance probe's been destroyed, sir. <br>
VORSHAK: Perimeter defence stand by. Feed the coordinates of the
hostile directly to them. We'll blast it out of the water. <br>
KARINA: I can't. The only thing registering on the scanners is marine
life. <br>
PRESTON: That can't be so. A creature strong enough to destroy the
probe doesn't exist. <br>
VORSHAK: Well? <br>
BULIC: Karina's right. <br>
(The screen lights up. Missile Run Green Alert.) <br>
VORSHAK: Maddox, verify. <br>
MADDOX: Computer has started countdown. <br>
VORSHAK: Your assessment, Bulic? <br>
BULIC: It's difficult to tell. It could be a practice run ordered by
the computer. Equally it could have been triggered by what's happened
out there. <br>
VORSHAK: Then we must assume the missile run is for real. All teams to
battle stations. <br>
PRESTON: Battle teams one, two and three take up defence position. <br>
KARINA: Sentinel Six reports engaging unidentified flying object.
Attempts to shoot it down proved unsuccessful, but it has now
disappeared. <br>
(Missile Run Yellow Alert) <br>
BULIC: Missile computer is on automatic targeting. Arming of the proton
missiles is in progress. <br>
(The lights turn red.) <br>
VORSHAK: Prepare to sync up. Maddox! I said take up your position. The
function of the base depends on you! What's wrong? <br>
MADDOX: I can't do it, sir. <br>
VORSHAK: Without you, our missiles are useless. <br>
MADDOX: Don't you think I realise that? <br>
VORSHAK: Sync up, Maddox. Find out what the computer is doing. Come on,
we could be at war! <br>
(Reluctantly, Maddox goes over to a chair under a tall column.) </font></p>

Base.) <br>

TURLOUGH: I don't think the Doctor does either. <br>
(The Doctor comes out from underneath the console.) <br>

final decision to the Commander. <br>
MADDOX: But I still have to press the button. <br>
BULIC: It may not come to that. <br>
(A dome comes down over Maddox's head and plugs him in. It hurts.) <br>
BULIC: We have sync up to missile computer, Commander. <br>
VORSHAK: Go ahead, Maddox. <br>

sigh of relief.) <br>
VORSHAK: We can breathe again. <br>
(Maddox is released from the sync, and collapses.) <br>
NILSON: Commander! <br>
VORSHAK: Get him out of here. <br>
NILSON: Take him to the PS unit. <br>
VORSHAK: What a time for a practice run. <br>
BULIC: You realise the base is defenceless with Maddox in the state he
is. <br>
PRESTON: And we still haven't established what destroyed our probe, nor
what Sentinel Six shot at. <br>
(A guard carries Maddox out over his shoulder.) <br>
VORSHAK: Sound the all clear, but the base it to remain on full alert. </font></p>

TURLOUGH: Doctor. <br>
(Turlough offers a handkerchief.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. <br>
(Chemical store.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha. That, Turlough, was the all clear. <br>
TEGAN: Must be some kind of research station. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, it's a Sea Base. A rather special kind of undersea
military colony. Help me get this open, would you? Armed with the sort
of missiles that kill life but leave everything else intact. <br>
(The Doctor and Turlough push at the door, but it refuses to move.
Tegan gently slides it to one side and goes through.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Proton? <br>

NILSON [OC]: Nilson here. We have a problem with Maddox. I think you
should come down, Commander. <br>

DOCTOR: Around 2084. <br>
TEGAN: Little seems to have changed since my time. <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely nothing, Tegan. There are still two power blocs,
fingers poised to annihilate each other. Hexachromite. <br>
TURLOUGH: What do they use that for? <br>
DOCTOR: Hexachromite gas. It's part of a sealing compound for undersea
structures. It's lethal to marine and reptile life. I thought they
would have banned it by now. <br>
TEGAN: Progress doesn't seem to have solved anything. <br>
DOCTOR: No. </font></p>

NILSON: He's suffering from severe stress. It's our considered opinion
that he's unfit for duty. <br>
VORSHAK: But I need him. Without a sync operator, this base will cease
to have any military function. <br>
NILSON: And I realise that, otherwise I'd hesitate proposing the one
option that you still have. <br>
VORSHAK: And that is? <br>
NILSON: Release the duplicate programme disc. That way we could probe
deeper into Maddox's mind, break through the barriers and reassure him.
<br>
VORSHAK: But I can't do that, not without authority from Sea Base
Command. <br>
NILSON: If we are to maintain operational efficiency, there really is
no other way. <br>
SOLOW: I will take full responsibility. There are humanitarian as well
as military considerations here. Maddox will have a total mental
collapse unless treated. <br>
VORSHAK: All right. <br>
(Vorshak goes to a nearby bench and places his hand on a scanner pad.
Then he punches in a code and a portion of the bench rises. Another
palmprint reader and code pad are there.) <br>
VORSHAK: But don't let this disc out of your sight. <br>
(A plastic screen slides down and he removes one small disc out of a
row of six.) <br>

NILSON: You're sure this will work? <br>
SOLOW: The information on that disc is fed straight into the deepest

no other choice but to obey. </font></p>

TURLOUGH: What's wrong? <br>

TURLOUGH: I pressed for the lift. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it has to be done in sequence. It's what's called

front of them.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Computer room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan and Bulic climb down into the room and
cross to the door. Bulic looks into the bridge.) <br>
BULIC: The Doctor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ICHTAR: Initiate the test firing sequence. <br>
(Vorshak places his palm on the scanner. Bulic slides open the door and
the Doctor notices him. He checks that no one else has, and nods. Bulic
closes the door.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Computer room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Did he see you? <br>
BULIC: Yes, and he'd better hurry. It can't be long before they
discover we've escaped. <br>
(The Doctor moves over to the sync operator's chair but a Sea Devil
turns around and he moves back. The Sea Devil looks away and the Doctor
backs into the computer room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Excellent timing. Is Turlough safe? <br>
TEGAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Lead on. <br>
BULIC: But aren't we going to get the Commander out? <br>
DOCTOR: Impossible. They need him in there. <br>
BULIC: Well, we must at least try. <br>
DOCTOR: Not here, not now. We'll come back for him, I promise. <br>
TEGAN: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: The chemical store. <br>
(The Doctor gives Tegan a boost up back into the ventilation shaft.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sea Base]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Preston and Turlough have escaped.) <br>
PRESTON: This way. <br>
(They collect weapons from a pair of dead guards.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SAUVIX: The primitives have escaped. <br>
ICHTAR: Explain. <br>
SAUVIX: Where is the Doctor? <br>
ICHTAR: Commander? Find the Doctor. Find the primitives. Kill them! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Preston and Turlough can hear weapons fire.) <br>
TURLOUGH: They must be mopping up survivors. <br>
PRESTON: Or your friends. Either way, shouldn't we help them? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ICHTAR: Connect the manipulator. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sea Base]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Hurry up, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
(The two groups meet round a corner.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Turlough. <br>
TURLOUGH: You didn't think I'd leave you? <br>
TEGAN: It never crossed my mind. <br>
PRESTON: Where were you going? <br>
DOCTOR: The chemical store. <br>
BULIC: This way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ICHTAR: Is the computer fully operational? <br>
TARPOK: Restored and tested. <br>
ICHTAR: Then align the manipulator to the computer. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chemical store]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Watch the doors. <br>
(The Doctor goes straight to the racks of hexachromite tanks.) <br>
TEGAN: What are we looking for? <br>
DOCTOR: An alternative to this. Something less lethal that will do the
job just as well. <br>
PRESTON: Do you know what the Silurians want? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, all in all they were very forthcoming, really. They
intend to launch your missiles and trigger a war to end all wars,
between your people, of course. <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor! <br>
(Everyone scatters and hides as a Sea Devil enters. The Doctor knocks
something over and it turns towards him, then fires. The energy bolt
punctures a hexachromite tank and the gas kills it, then dissolves its
inner organs, which leak out as green goo from its eyes and nose.
Everyone comes out of hiding.) <br>
PRESTON: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Hexachromite. It does that to all reptile life. <br>
PRESTON: Then use it on the invaders. <br>
DOCTOR: And kill them? <br>
PRESTON: Why not? They're about to start a war that will destroy
everyone on Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: I sometimes wonder why I like the people of this miserable
planet so much. The Silurians and Sea Devils are noble races. They have
skills and talents you pathetic humans can only dream about. <br>
TURLOUGH: That doesn't alter what they're about to do. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, and we must stop them. <br>
TEGAN: What's the alternative? <br>
DOCTOR: Something that will disable rather than kill. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TARPOK: Manipulator aligned with the computer. <br>
SCIBUS: Alignment confirmed. <br>
ICHTAR: Good. Then we can proceed. <br>
(The screen flashes - Missile Run Green Alert.) <br>
ICHTAR: Is this a practice missile run? <br>
VORSHAK: It's impossible to tell. <br>
ICHTAR: Check the manipulator. <br>
SCIBUS: Readings confirm a computer controlled practice run. <br>
ICHTAR: It is time to stop this game. Activate the manipulator. Launch
the missiles. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chemical store]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BULIC: Missile alert. <br>
PRESTON: Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear. What does it mean? <br>
BULIC: Final countdown is imminent. <br>
TURLOUGH: What are you going to do? <br>
TEGAN: You must decide, Doctor. Billions of people could die. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, all right. Turlough, get the grill open. Preston, fetch
that pump. We have to feed the gas into the ventilation system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCIBUS: Missiles are armed and targeted. <br>
VORSHAK: You're mad. <br>
ICHTAR: The ape primitives have developed this weaponry. We cannot be
held responsible for it. <br>
VORSHAK: Contact the heads of governments. Tell them your demands.
They'll listen. <br>
ICHTAR: Your people have already had their chance. <br>
VORSHAK: Try one more time, for pity's sake. <br>
ICHTAR: It is too late for pity. It is much too late. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chemical store]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: It'll take some time for the gas to spread
throughout the Base. <br>
TEGAN: Will it be fast enough? <br>
DOCTOR: I hope it won't be necessary at all. If I can get to the bridge
in time, I may be able to reason with Ichtar, persuade him to abandon
the missile run. <br>
TURLOUGH: You've tried that already. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, this time I'll have something to back my argument. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ICHTAR: Soon it'll all be over. <br>
TARPOK: There is computer resistance to the manipulator. <br>
VORSHAK: I said you wouldn't succeed. <br>
ICHTAR: Increase power, Tarpok. It seems that your computers are as
stubborn as you are, Commander. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chemical store]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Now, I want you all to go back to the
Tardis. You'll be safer there whatever happens. <br>
BULIC: We've gone to yellow alert. <br>
DOCTOR: I must go. <br>
SAUVIX: So, Doctor, I have found you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The intercom beeps.) <br>
ICHTAR: Speak. <br>
SAUVIX [OC]: I have found the Doctor. <br>
ICHTAR: And you have your orders. Kill him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chemical store]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: You must listen to me. <br>
SAUVIX: No, Doctor, you must die. But first, switch off the pump. <br>
(As Sauvix turns his back on her, Preston goes for a weapon. Sauvix
turns and kills her, then Bulic lets off a canister of gas at him.) <br>
TEGAN: She's dead. <br>
DOCTOR: A waste. <br>
TEGAN: Well, don't let her death count for nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, I must get to the bridge. <br>
TEGAN: Doctor, you'll need some help. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, all right. Bring oxygen. We may need it. <br>
(Tegan and Turlough grab oxygen masks.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCIBUS: The computer has stabilised. <br>
TARPOK: The manipulator has regained control. <br>
(The lights go red.) <br>
ICHTAR: Now do you believe me, Commander? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sea Base]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The group sees a pair of Sea Devils collapse by a
ventilation grill.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's working, and quickly. I can't bargain with Ichtar if his
guards are dead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bridge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The targeting programme comes up on the screen.) <br>
VORSHAK: No! <br>
ICHTAR: Fetch him. <br>
VORSHAK: I will not be responsible for the destruction of my own kind. <br>
(A Sea Devil forces Vorshak's palm onto the scanner.) <br>
ICHTAR: The final phase. <br>
(Bulic connects up another hexachromite canister as it starts to pour
into the back of the bridge. The screen says Red Alert. The Doctor,
Turlough and Tegan run in.) <br>
ICHTAR: Disarm them! You're just in time to witness the missile launch,
Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, wait. Your warriors are dying everywhere. Abandon the base.
<br>
TEGAN: Look, it's hexachromite gas. <br>
DOCTOR: Abandon the launch! There's still time to save your own lives. <br>
ICHTAR: There are millions more ready to replace us. <br>
DOCTOR: Who will replace you? With you dies the last of the Triad, the
custodians of your race. What will become of your people then? <br>
ICHTAR: You talk in vain, Doctor. Kill them! Kill them! <br>
(But the Sea Devils fall to their knees, dying. The Doctor runs to the
intercom.) <br>
DOCTOR: Bulic, turn off the gas! <br>
ICHTAR: Commence ignition, Scibus! <br>
(The Silurians collapse.) <br>
DOCTOR: The missiles are set to fire. How long have we got? <br>
VORSHAK: Less than three minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the abort procedure? <br>
VORSHAK: Well, a phased electrical charge aimed directly at the
ignition circuit. It restores the launch to simulation. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it must be done at once. <br>
VORSHAK: It's impossible. Only a sync operator can do it, and Maddox is
dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I shall have to try. <br>
VORSHAK: But the computer would burn out your mind in seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you have a better idea? <br>
VORSHAK: Very well, get into the seat. <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor, try to disconnect the computer first. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, there isn't time. <br>
VORSHAK: He's right. We're already on final countdown to ignition. <br>
DOCTOR: Tegan, look after the Silurians. Give them oxygen. <br>
VORSHAK: Now, I can perform the manual tasks, but you will have to do
the rest. <br>
(The clear helmet sits over the Doctor's head. 94 and counting.) <br>
TEGAN: Good luck, Doctor. <br>
TURLOUGH: The strain's too great. He'll never manage it. <br>
VORSHAK: No. No, his mind is synchronised with the computer. Doctor,
can you hear me? <br>
(The Doctor nods.) <br>
VORSHAK: I'm going to switch you through to the ignition circuit. <br>
TURLOUGH: The oxygen isn't having much effect. <br>
TEGAN: This one's coming round. <br>
TURLOUGH: See to the other Silurian there. <br>
(Tegan goes to Scibus at the console.) <br>
VORSHAK: I've isolated the ignition circuit, Doctor. Can you identify
it? Nod if you can. <br>
(A nod.) <br>
VORSHAK: Concentrate, Doctor. I will now feed in the charge. To burn
out the circuit, concentrate and direct it. <br>
(Tegan's recovering Silurian gets a Sea Devil weapon.) <br>
TEGAN: Turlough! <br>
VORSHAK: The charge must be in phase with the pulse of the circuit. If
not, it will destroy you. <br>
TURLOUGH: Look out, Commander. <br>
(The Silurian shoots Vorshak in the back.) <br>
VORSHAK: Now concentrate, Doctor. Let nothing distract you. <br>
(Turlough gets the weapon off the Silurian and shoots it.) <br>
VORSHAK: Now, Doctor! <br>
(Electricity plays over the helmet. The countdown is at 009 when the
helmet rises from the Doctor's head.) <br>
VORSHAK: You've done it. <br>
(002, 001, Cancelled.) <br>
VORSHAK: He did it! <br>
(Vorshak collapses and dies across Scibus.) <br>
TEGAN: He's alive. <br>
TURLOUGH: The Commander wasn't so lucky, I'm afraid. He's been shot. <br>
DOCTOR: Did I succeed? <br>
TEGAN: Yes, Doctor. <br>
TURLOUGH: They're all dead, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: There should have been another way. </font> </p>
