takes out a pen and paper. After writing a note, he gets a small

SPANDRELL: What sentence? <br>
ENGIN: Oh, I beg your pardon. Banishment to Earth. <br>

ENGIN: Sol Three, in Mutter's Spiral. Rather an interesting little
planet, I understand. Several of our <br>
SPANDRELL: Is there anything further of relevance I should know,
Coordinator Engin? <br>
ENGIN: I see there is an addendum. Ah, yes. The sentence was
subsequently remitted at the intercession of the CIA. <br>
SPANDRELL: Celestial Intervention Agency. They get their fingers into
everything. Is he mixed up with them? <br>
ENGIN: There's nothing further on the file. <br>
SPANDRELL: Oh yes, they'd see to it that there wouldn't be. Can you get
me his extract biog? <br>
ENGIN: Yes, certainly. Won't take a moment. <br>
(Engin goes to a storage area and Hildred enters.) <br>
HILDRED: Castellan, I have to report the intruder in Sector seven <br>
SPANDRELL: Well? <br>
HILDRED: Evaded us. And he shot one of my guards. <br>
SPANDRELL: I see. Such efficiency. <br>
HILDRED: But we have him trapped in the communications tower,
Castellan. <br>
SPANDRELL: Well done, Hildred. An antiquated capsule, for which you get
adequate early warning, tranducts on the very perimeter of the Capitol.
You are informed that the occupant is a known criminal, whereupon you
allow him to escape and conceal himself in a building a mere fifty
three stories high. A clever stratagem, Hildred. You're trying to
confuse him, I take it? <br>
HILDRED: I apologise, Castellan. He won't evade capture a second time. <br>
SPANDRELL: In the light of your impressive record so far, I would make
no rash commitments. <br>
HILDRED: I found this in the capsule. <br>
(Spandrell takes the Doctor's note and reads it.) <br>
SPANDRELL: To the Castellan of the Chancery Guard. I've good reason to
think the life of His Supremacy the President is in grave danger. Do
not ignore this warning. The Doctor. And he signed it over the
Prydonian Seal. <br>
ENGIN: Apparently he is or was at one time a member of that noble
Chapter. <br>
SPANDRELL: How can you tell? <br>
ENGIN: Well, the biog data extracts of Time Lords are colour coded
according to Chapter. <br>
SPANDRELL: I didn't know that. <br>
ENGIN: No? Well, your duties usually involve you with more plebian
classes, don't they, Castellan. <br>
SPANDRELL: A Prydonian renegade, eh? I have to refer this to Chancellor
Goth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Spandrell is showing the note to Bernard
Horsfall, a series regular.) <br>
SPANDRELL: He's a Prydonian renegade, sir, and as you know, when a
Prydonian forswears his birthright, there is nothing else he fears to
lose. <br>
GOTH: So you think there is a real danger, Castellan? <br>
SPANDRELL: He has already killed one of the guards. I think he's
ruthless and determined. A typical CIA agent. <br>
GOTH: But if he is a member of the Celestial Intervention Agency, why
should he wish to harm the President? <br>
SPANDRELL: He could have been suborned. If he's being false to his
Prydonian vows, his fidelity is already suspect. <br>
GOTH: But this note? Why warn us in advance? <br>
(Goth sits in a fur-covered chair.) <br>
SPANDRELL: Perhaps to get us nervous, or just looking the wrong way.
Prydonians are notoriously <br>
GOTH: Devious? Not true, Castellan. We simply see a little further
ahead than most. Anyway, what is it you want? <br>
SPANDRELL: Permission to withdraw fifty guards from the Panopticon to
search the communications tower. <br>
GOTH: A great loss of pomp and circumstance. <br>
SPANDRELL: I'll feel much happier once he is in custody. <br>
GOTH: Very well, Spandrell. I should like to see this Tardis.
Extraordinary to think an old Type Forty is still operational. <br>
SPANDRELL: It's in Sector seven, cloisters. <br>
GOTH: Then we'll have to hurry. I have an audience with the Cardinals
in a few minutes. </font></p>

RUNCIBLE [on viewscreen]: In a moment, I hope to talk to Cardinal
Borusa, the leader of the Prydonian Chapter, the Chapter that has
produced more Time Lord Presidents than all other Chapters together,

BORUSA: Thank you, Runcible. Good day. <br>
RUNCIBLE: No, no, wait, sir. Please, if I could ask you a few
questions. <br>
BORUSA: Runcible, you had ample opportunity to ask me questions during
your mis-spent years at the Academy. You failed to avail yourself of
the opportunity then and it is too late now. Good day. </font></p>

Borusa cannot, at this present moment in the time band, commit himself.
However, it is certainly no secret that a very senior member of the
Prydonian Chapter, and the present number two in the Time Lord Council,
Chancellor Goth, is the widely fancied candidate. <br>

accomplice. <br>
GOTH: From within? <br>
SPANDRELL: Perhaps he's gone to the tower to shake of his pursuers
while somebody inside lifts the barrier. <br>
GOTH: What an inventive suspicious mind you have, Spandrell. So this in
an old Type Forty. <br>
SPANDRELL: Its shape was infinitely variable. <br>
GOTH: Remarkably good condition. What are you going to do with it? <br>
SPANDRELL: I hadn't thought. I was more interested in its operator. <br>
GOTH: Well, I shouldn't leave it here in case he tries to sneak back.
Transduct it back into the Capitol. <br>

GOTH: This is a constitutional crisis. The President died without
naming his successor. An election must be held within forty eight
hours. <br>

DOCTOR: I'd like to help you. How about a signed confession? <br>
SPANDRELL: That will help. I hate going to court without possessing the

SPANDRELL: I don't think so. <br>
ENGIN: The machine is infallible. Data extraction is impossible without
an operating key like this. <br>
(Engin keeps his on a string attached to his belt.) <br>
ENGIN: And the code of the particular key is recorded here, opposite
the archive number of the data extract. <br>
(Engin inserts his key.) <br>
ENGIN: Now, as you can see, my key is the only one entered against the

GOTH: Oh, I understand that, Cardinal, but there is another
consideration. Quite possibly, after the election, I shall have the

BORUSA: You're being over-modest, Chancellor. I'm sure of it. Just as
I'm sure that the President would have named you as his successor. <br>
GOTH: Who knows what was in the President's mind? But it is the custom,
as you know, for an incoming president to pardon political prisoners.
Is he to set free the murderer of his predecessor, or break with
custom? Either course would be difficult. I intend to avoid the dilemma
by seeing this affair through before he takes office. <br>

will kill him'? <br>
TIME LORD: Well, yes, I suppose it is possible. He could have said
that. <br>
GOTH: Thank you. Has the accused anything to say before sentence is
pronounced? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Article Seventeen. <br>
GOTH: Article Seventeen? <br>
DOCTOR: I offer myself as a candidate for the Presidency. <br>
(General mutterings of disbelief.) <br>
GOTH: The application is frivolous. <br>
DOCTOR: No, sir. I invoke Article Seventeen of the Constitution which
is a guarantee of liberty and says, in part, that no candidate for
office shall in anyway be debarred or restrained from presenting his

GOTH: The guarantee of liberty does not extend to murderers. <br>
BORUSA: As a jurist, Chancellor, I must point out that until the

over that distance. It makes sense, Spandrell. <br>
SPANDRELL: Maybe, but why? <br>
DOCTOR: I told you. Because he has an old score to settle. <br>
ENGIN: Doctor, I simply cannot believe that anybody could do what
you're suggesting. How can one intercept a thought pattern from within
the Matrix itself? <br>
DOCTOR: By going in there and joining it. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, in a sense that's all a living mind is, electrochemical

the top. Another miss. The Doctor finds a place to hide behind a
buddleia bush on the cliff face, but he does not notice that there is a
giant spider sitting in its web behind him. The hunter makes his way
across the valley towards the cliff as the spider lowers itself in
front of the Doctor. The hunter puts down his rifle and raises his mask
to drink from his water canteen, then consults a map.) <br>

thorn, then breaks more off and crawls onwards before climbing a tree.

bottle then places it in his reed, turning it into a blow pipe. The
hunter approaches cautiously. The Doctor blows, and the thorn hits the
hunter in the thigh. He looks up and shoots. The Doctor falls from the
tree. The hunter pulls out the thorn and cuts his trouser leg to see
the wound it has left. The Doctor rolls over to reveal he has been shot
in the right upper arm. He staggers away. The hunter jabs himself with

death? <br>
SPANDRELL: Apart from ourselves, Hildred and the two guards who took
the body to the Panopticon vault. <br>
BORUSA: Then we shall rely on their silence. We shall change the
appearance of the corpse, Castellan. We all know the posthumous effect
of a staser bolt. Within the hour, the body will be charred beyond
recognition. Our story is going to be that the Master arrived in
Gallifrey to assassinate the President, secretly. Before he could
escape, Chancellor Goth tracked him down and killed him, unfortunately
perishing himself in the exchange of fire. Now that's much better. I
can believe that. <br>

compile a new biog of him. It doesn't have to be entirely accurate. <br>

cannot make the Master into a public enemy if there is no data on him. <br>
ENGIN: I can have an authentic seeming data extract ready by morning,
Cardinal. <br>

another look at data security. We cannot have Time Lord DEs simply
vanishing from the records. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Panopticon vault]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The entrance door has been sealed by the Master.)
<br>
ENGIN: It's no good. We can never move it. <br>
DOCTOR: You're right, but we've got to get out of this place. <br>
(The Doctor goes over to a sloping shaft by the biers.) <br>
DOCTOR: There's a light up there. Where does that lead, Spandrell? <br>
SPANDRELL: The Panopticon. An old service shaft. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
ENGIN: It's a hundred feet, Doctor, at least. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, come on, give us a bunk up. <br>
(The Master has put on the Sash, and walked around the Eye. He opens
one of the valves, removing the pipe from the Eye, and the place
shakes.) <br>
ENGIN: What's that? <br>
SPANDRELL: If the Doctor's right, the end of the world is approaching. <br>
(Rocks tumble down the service shaft.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Panopticon]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Two more pipes have been removed. The Master
strokes the Eye.) <br>
MASTER: Rassilon's discovery, all mine. I shall have supreme power over
the universe. Master of all matter! Bwhahahaha! <br>
(The Doctor makes it to the top of the shaft as the building starts to
fall apart.) <br>
MASTER: Doctor, my congratulations. You're just in time for the end. <br>
DOCTOR: You're insane. You're insane, do you hear me? You're releasing
a force that nothing can stop. <br>
MASTER: Take the Rod. You can take it with you to your grave, except
that none of you will need a grave. <br>
(The Master reaches for the final pipe.) <br>
DOCTOR: If you undo that, you'll die as surely as any of us. <br>
MASTER: You can do better than that, Doctor. Even in extremis, I wear
the Sash of Rassilon. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and the President was wearing it when he was shot down.
The Sash won't protect you. It's damaged. <br>
MASTER: You lie. <br>
(The Doctor pushes the Master away from the Eye, and replaces one pipe.
The Master tackles him, then chases him up the steps, swinging a club
or something at him. At the top, the Doctor turns and pushes the Master
back down the steps then returns to replace the pipes. The Master tries
one more time to stop him, but gets a punch in the stomach for his
efforts and goes down. The floor of the Panopticon splits, and the
Master falls into the crack. He tries to pull himself out, but cannot
get a grip, and finally falls, screaming. The Doctor continues to
replace the pipes on the Eye. When the final one is in place, the
planet stops shaking and the Doctor takes a deep breath in relief. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chancellery]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Borusa runs his fingers through a layer of stone
dust on his desk. The Doctor is lounging in the fur-lined chair.) <br>
BORUSA: Half the city in ruins. Untold damage, countless lives lost. <br>
ENGIN: But for the Doctor it could have been much worse. <br>
BORUSA: Yes indeed, I am conscious of the debt we owe the Doctor. But
Gallifrey has never know such a catastrophe, such devastation. What
will we say? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you'll just have to adjust the truth again, Cardinal.
What about subsidence owing to a plague of mice? <br>
BORUSA: As I believe I told you long ago, Doctor, you will never amount
to anything in the galaxy while you retain your propensity for vulgar
facetiousness. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, sir. You said that many times, sir. May I go, sir? <br>
BORUSA: Certainly you may, preferably with the utmost expedition.
Perhaps you will see that the transduction barriers are raised,
Castellan. <br>
SPANDRELL: Yes, sir. <br>
BORUSA: Oh, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Sir? <br>
BORUSA: Nine out of ten. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Thank you, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Museum]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Engin and the Doctor walk past a long case clock
and on to the Tardis.) <br>
ENGIN: You know, Doctor, if you wanted to stay, I'm sure any past
difficulties could be overlooked. <br>
DOCTOR: But I like it out there, thank you very much. <br>
SPANDRELL: The barriers are raised, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Spandrell. <br>
ENGIN: It's we who should thank you, Doctor, for destroying the Master.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I didn't actually see him fall, you know. I was quite
busy. <br>
ENGIN: Oh, but if by some miracle he survived the fall into that chasm,
he was dying anyway. <br>
DOCTOR: There was a good deal of power coming out of that monolith, and
the Sash would have helped him to convert it. <br>
SPANDRELL: Are you suggesting he survived? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I hope not, Spandrell. And there's no one in all the
galaxies I'd say that about. The quintessence of evil. Goodbye,
Spandrell. <br>
SPANDRELL: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
ENGIN: Goodbye, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, goodbye, Engin, goodbye. <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis and shuts the door. The Tardis
dematerialises. I prefer that word to 'transducts'. Spandrell turns and
sees a wizened hand move a curtain by the long case clock.) <br>
SPANDRELL: Look, the Master. <br>
ENGIN: Where do you think they're heading? <br>
SPANDRELL: Out into the universe. But, you know, I have a feeling it
isn't big enough for the two of them.) <br>
(The Master's face appears in the clock face.) <br>
MASTER: Bwhahahaha! <br>
(The clock dematerialises.) </font> </p>
