incongruously in the steaming alien jungle on the reddish brown planet.
A slim human with a white beard comes out and plants a sign at the head
of a mound off to the left of the structure. The sign reads - Egard

got to leave. <br>
SORENSON: What? <br>
BALDWIN: It's fifteen degrees to night. <br>
SORENSON: Just look at this, Baldwin. It's showing more than seventy
pure. <br>
BALDWIN: We'll never make base from here, sir, if we don't leave now. <br>
SORENSON: The last time we hit a vein as rich as this, you know what
happened? <br>
BALDWIN: Yes. Lorenzo died. He was the first. That's when it all seemed
to start. <br>
SORENSON: We lost it. The vein vanished. This damned planet took it
back. It's alive, you know, Baldwin. It watches every move we make. I
won't be beaten again. Load the canisters. <br>
BALDWIN: Professor, please. There isn't time now. We can return
tomorrow. <br>
SORENSON: It'll be gone by tomorrow. Don't you see, man? It knows. It
senses what we're trying to do. <br>
BALDWIN: I'm not trekking back through that jungle in the dark. If you
don't come now, I shall have to leave you. <br>
SORENSON: Well, then, leave. Leave. <br>
(Back at base, Braun checks his chronometer, takes a rifle from the
wall and goes outside. Something crackles in the jungle nearby. Braun
backs away, frightened, then falls. He appears to be trying to push
away something heavy but invisible, then he vanishes. The crackling
fades away.) </font></p>

SARAH: How long have we been travelling? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? What did you say? <br>
SARAH: You promised me we'd be back in London five minutes before
leaving Loch Ness. <br>
DOCTOR: Did I? <br>
SARAH: Oh, you're trying to wriggle out of it. <br>
DOCTOR: Wriggle out of what? <br>
SARAH: Your promise. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, we're on the edge of a time-space vortex and you're
talking in minutes. <br>
SARAH: Oh, I see. What's gone wrong this time? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Nothing at all. What makes you think something's gone
wrong? <br>
SARAH: Because you always get rude when you're trying to cover up a
mistake. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing of consequence. Slight overshoot, easily rectified. <br>
SARAH: Come on, where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: We've come out of the time vortex at the wrong point, that's
all. A few years too late. <br>
SARAH: How many? <br>
DOCTOR: Thirty thousand. <br>
(A beeping sound starts up.) <br>

DOCTOR: This way. <br>
(A little further on.) <br>
SARAH: You don't know where we are. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, with any luck, we're near enough to reach wherever it is. <br>
SARAH: That is not what I meant. <br>
DOCTOR: Before whatever it was that made them transmit the call
overwhelms them. That is, if we're not too late already. <br>
SARAH: I mean, what planet? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a weak signal. Allowing for the fact of interference
from the time warp, could you move any faster? <br>
SARAH: I'm doing the best I can. <br>

out.) </font></p>

sits at a glass table.) <br>
SALAMAR: Crew deck, orbital entry imminent. Ponti and de Haan to
command area. Ponti and de Haan to command area. Vishinsky, you'll lead
the landing party. <br>
VISHINSKY: Without Ponti? <br>
SALAMAR: You are the most experienced officer. <br>
VISHINSKY: You are going to scan first? <br>
SALAMAR: No. <br>
VISHINSKY: It's advised procedure before physical landing on any
ex-planet. <br>
SALAMAR: Technically, Zeta Minor is not an ex-planet. Professor
Sorenson's party's been on the surface for months. <br>
VISHINSKY: They might have been dead for months. They've not reported. <br>
SALAMAR: Vishinsky, you know our fuel position. We've enough for the
return journey and an emergency reserve. I cannot waste that on a low
level scan. <br>
VISHINSKY: It's your decision, Controller. I'll get equipped for
descent. </font></p>

crackling has stopped.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah? You all right? What's the matter? <br>
SARAH: I don't know. Just suddenly felt so odd, as though my mind left
my body. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right now? <br>
SARAH: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: You look all right. <br>
SARAH: Yeah. What's that you've found? <br>
DOCTOR: Hand tool of some kind. <br>
(Like a pick axe, but all metal.) <br>
SARAH: So the people who sent that signal must be humanoid. Well, if
they've got hands? </font></p>

Controller goes down to speak to them.) <br>
SALAMAR: The descent chamber's ready, Ponti. <br>
PONTI: (Jamaican) Yes, Controller. <br>
SALAMAR: The probe will remain in free orbit in case emergency escape
procedures are needed. From the time you land, maintain permanent audio
contact. <br>
DE HAAN: Understood, Controller. <br>
SALAMAR: The descent area is the one selected for Sorenson, so you
should have no difficulty locating the base. <br>
VISHINSKY: Unless something gets in our way. <br>
SALAMAR: You're equipped and trained to deal with all normal
contingencies. The prime purpose of this mission is to locate Professor
Sorenson's expedition. If hostile forces are found to be operating on
Zeta Minor, we've the capacity to eliminate them. <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
SALAMAR: Right, we're in orbit. Prepare for descent. <br>

DOCTOR: Anyone about? No one about. <br>
SARAH: Can't we have some lights? <br>
DOCTOR: Probably the power's run down. <br>
SARAH: That would account for the weak signal. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Ah. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Automatic distress button. It all adds up. May have been
running for months. High capacity power cell dependant for sunlight on
charging. <br>
SARAH: So we're still in the solar system. <br>
DOCTOR: We're still in a solar system, but what particular star
provides the light and energy? Wherever we are, we're a long way out.
SARAH: I wonder what happened here? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well, this is clearly the base for some kind of scientific
expedition, possibly geological. Something went wrong and they sent out
a distress signal. <br>
SARAH: And died before help arrived. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. A lost expedition. <br>
SARAH: So, what are we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: So, let's go back to the Tardis and fetch my spectromixer, and
I'll fix our position by that star. Then I'll repair this power cell
and try and make contact. <br>
SARAH: Well, you can get on with that now. I'll fetch the spectromixer.
<br>
DOCTOR: Good idea. Would you do that? <br>
SARAH: Why not? I know the way. <br>
DOCTOR: Good thinking. What are you waiting for? <br>
SARAH: The key. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
(The Doctor gives Sarah the Tardis key.) <br>
SARAH: Right. See you. <br>

compartment. The Doctor opens the door and enters. He finds Baldwin's
desiccated remains on the floor.) <br>

parts a bush with invisible hands and watches her go inside. Then de
Haan, Ponti, Vishinsky and two other men arrive.) <br>

probe. <br>

not attempt entry. <br>
VISHINSKY [OC]: Shall we apply disintegrators? <br>
SALAMAR: On no account. It'll yield essential information on hostile
forces. Your orders are, transpose object to probe. Out. Prepare the
quarantine berth. </font></p>

the device she needs and puts it in her jeans pocket, then goes to open

them herself.) <br>
VISHINSKY: All right, stand clear. <br>
(The Tardis vanishes.) <br>
VISHINSKY: Movement. Over there. Approach and identify yourself. <br>
(A man comes up to them.) <br>
VISHINSKY: Professor Sorenson! <br>
SORENSON: I've been observing you for some time. One has to be careful
on this planet. Appearances can be deceptive. <br>
VISHINSKY: You all right, Professor? <br>
SORENSON: Oh, yes. It's nearly dawn. The days are quite safe. <br>
VISHINSKY: But how are you? Galactic Mission Control received no word
from you. They sent us to investigate. <br>
SORENSON: I'm well. I'm more than well. My theory about Zeta Minor has
proved to be true. Only last night I made the vital discovery in Sector
five. <br>
VISHINSKY: Where are the others? <br>
SORENSON: Baldwin returned to the base last night. He was suffering
from, from fatigue. He'll be fine now. Come, I'll show you the way. <br>
VISHINSKY: There were eight in your expedition. <br>
SORENSON: Yes, we've had difficulties. Conditions are hard. We've lost
some, but the important thing is the mission has been a success. We
found what we came to find. <br>
VISHINSKY: How many have you lost? <br>
SORENSON: He'll be fine now. It's just tiredness. He needs a good rest.
It's not far. </font></p>

SALAMAR: You are in orbit around planet Zeta Minor. You're a Morestran

MORELLI: Command deck calling you, Commander. <br>

VISHINSKY [OC]: He's too shocked. His mental state is strained. <br>
(Sarah is brought in.) <br>
SALAMAR: Understandable. We arrived just in time. And the prisoner? <br>
VISHINSKY [OC]: Just repeats the same story. <br>
SALAMAR: Keep a careful watch on him. I may have better fortune. <br>
(Down on the planet, something roars and crackles through the jungle.) <br>
SALAMAR: You picked it up? <br>
SARAH: That's what I said. We picked up a distress call and landed
immediately. <br>
SALAMAR: Do you have any idea where Zeta Minor is situated? <br>
SARAH: No, not exactly. <br>
SALAMAR: It's beyond Cygnus A. It's as distant again from Ortoro galaxy
as that galaxy is from the Anterades. It's on the very edge of the
known universe. You just happened to be passing when you received this
distress call? <br>
SARAH: Well, no, no, no, we were on our way to London, to Earth. <br>
SALAMAR: To Earth? You said you came from Earth. <br>
SARAH: Yes, we do. That is, I do. You see, the Doctor said we could, we
could be back <br>
(The comm. beeps and Salamar answers it.) <br>
SALAMAR: Report. <br>
MORELLI [OC]: Landing site moving to obverse. Decision to land on
planet or continue in orbit imperative. <br>
SALAMAR: We'll go in now, before night. I think you and your friend,
the Doctor, know much more about Zeta Minor than you want us to think.
Take her away. Commence landing procedure. </font></p>

touched down next to the graveyard, and gather round the door to the
Base. Salamar listens to Sorenson's story.) <br>
SORENSON: We'd only been working a few weeks when Lorenzo went. After
that, Gura and then Summers. And then for a while, it stopped. We
thought that we were safe, that whatever it was had decided to leave us
in peace, but it wasn't to be. <br>
VISHINSKY: The killings always happened at night? <br>
SORENSON: Oh, yes. The nights are the worst. <br>
SALAMAR: Naturally. Any force of alien infiltrators is going to operate
under cover of dark. A full and immediate confession would save you
great discomfort. <br>
DOCTOR: Discomfort? You mean you're going to torture me. <br>
SALAMAR: Interrogate you. And nobody, Doctor, withstands Morestran
interrogation for very long. Put him with the other prisoner. <br>
(The Doctor is taken away.) <br>
SALAMAR: We must try and contact the home planet again. <br>
VISHINSKY: Not a chance, Controller. This far our, we're on our own. <br>
(Ponti and de Haan enter.) <br>
SALAMAR: Well? <br>
PONTI: We've searched a wide belt of the jungle in all directions. No
sign of any other life. <br>

invented another word for it. Antimatter, they called it. <br>
