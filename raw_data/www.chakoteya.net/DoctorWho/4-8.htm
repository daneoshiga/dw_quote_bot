JAMIE: It's a flying beastie! <br>
(An aeroplane is coming in to land, flaps down. Jamie and the Doctor
run, followed by Ben and Polly. It aborts its landing, missing them and
heading off back into the sky. A patrolling policemen sees the running
group.) <br>

MEADOWS: A police box on the runway. <br>
COMMANDANT: A likely story. Tell him to get back into stack and await
further instructions. <br>
MEADOWS: Yes sir. <br>
COMMANDANT: Miss Rock, get the Airport Police. <br>
MEADOWS: Gatwick Control, Sugar Delta X-Ray. Return to stack. <br>
COMMANDANT: Police? Commandant here. In-bound aircraft reports
obstruction on intersection of runways Five and Two. Investigate and
report back. Police Box. <br>
(Two motorcycle police ride off to investigate, then escort a
low-loader
carrying the Tardis off the runway. The policeman has failed to catch
Ben. The Doctor and Jamie are hiding behind the wheels of a parked
aeroplane.) <br>

SPENCER: Give me that envelope! <br>

man.) <br>
SPENCER: I would advise you to stop. <br>

envelope the man was carrying and drags the body a short way before
covering it with what looks like parachute silk, then leaves. Polly has
seen all this from behind some crates.) </font></p>

you dumped it by number four hangar, but what was it? It was a police
box? (to Jean) Get me the police chief. All right, you can bring those
planes down now. The obstruction's been cleared. <br>
MEADOWS: Right, sir. <br>
JEAN: Do you think it was some kind of practical joke, sir? Students or
maybe someone? <br>
COMMANDANT: Well, whoever it was they're going to pay for it as soon as
I get my hands on them. I'm not going to have the lives of passengers
endangered by practical jokers or anyone else. <br>
JEAN: Superintendent Reynolds? I have the Commandant for you. The Chief
of Police. <br>
COMMANDANT: Listen, what's all this about a police box on the runway?
Oh. Well, security's got to be tightened up all round. He reports that
four suspects were seen running away from it. <br>
JEAN: Did they catch them? <br>
COMMANDANT: No. Idiot of a policeman lost them. They're probably miles
away by now. Get me Immigration. Tell them to let me know if any
suspicious characters are seen in the area. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Polly! Over here! <br>
POLLY: Doctor, I've just seen a man killed. <br>
JAMIE: Hit by one of the beasties? <br>
POLLY: No, no. He was murdered by another man. <br>
DOCTOR: Get your breath, Polly, and tell us exactly what happened. <br>
POLLY: Well, I went into the hangar to get away from a policeman, and
there were two men in there. One of them had a gun and he shot the
other one. <br>
DOCTOR: The murderer, did he see you? <br>
POLLY: Well, he chased me, but I managed to lose him. <br>
DOCTOR: Could you find this hangar again? <br>
POLLY: Well, I think so. I can remember the name. It was Chameleon
something or other. Hey, where's Ben? <br>
DOCTOR: We haven't seen him. Come on, let's find this hangar. <br>
POLLY: But listen. The bloke with the gun, he'll be looking for me. <br>

had to stop him. <br>
(Blade checks the man's wallet.) <br>
BLADE: You killed Detective Inspector Gascoigne. A policeman. <br>
SPENCER: Do you think a parent sent him? <br>

BLADE: You must belong to some airline or the airport authority to be

POLLY: I've got nothing to do with the airport. We'd just arrived. We
were lost. I was trying to find someone to help me and I saw him kill a

COMMANDANT: Oh? And what's your theory? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid you won't believe it when you hear it.
However. First, Inspector Gascoigne was murdered with a ray gun. <br>
CROSSLAND: A ray gun? <br>
DOCTOR: A weapon that has not yet been developed on this Earth. <br>
COMMANDANT: Oh, really! <br>
DOCTOR: There, you see? I knew you wouldn't believe it. What's the use?
<br>
CROSSLAND: No, now be patient, sir. We are trying to understand you. <br>

front, a cover. <br>

DOCTOR: For the mass kidnapping of young people. <br>
COMMANDANT: And is all this supposed to be taking place in my airport? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, at this very moment! <br>
COMMANDANT: Oh, that's quite enough. Can't you take that fellow into
custody? <br>
CROSSLAND: Well, I'm very sorry, sir, but you know he hasn't broken any
law, except for this immigration business, and that's not my
responsibility. <br>
DOCTOR: But Brian Briggs is your responsibility. <br>
COMMANDANT: And who is he? <br>
DOCTOR: He's a young man who went on a Chameleon Tour and vanished. <br>
CROSSLAND: Now, come on Doctor, wait a minute. We're not certain of
that yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he's nowhere to be found. <br>
CROSSLAND: Well, no. <br>
DOCTOR: And neither are my two friends. Which to my mind proves my
point. Chameleon Tours are a cover for the abducting of young people. <br>
COMMANDANT: And just where do you think they're taking them? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, in view of the facts that I've already presented, the ray
gun, this pen and one or two other things, I think we're dealing with
people who are not from this planet. <br>
COMMANDANT: That hardly answers my que. What did you say? <br>
DOCTOR: You see, I knew you wouldn't believe me. <br>

only there was one solid piece of evidence. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's just come in. Do you mind if I question him? I

the white armband.) <br>

DOCTOR: Oh I think you do. Roll up your sleeve. <br>
MEADOWS 2: Do I have to take orders from him, sir? <br>
COMMANDANT: I think perhaps you should explain, Doctor. After all, this
man is working for me. <br>
DOCTOR: You only think he's working for you. Commandant, your personnel
are being systematically replaced, and this is how they are doing it.
This is not Meadows, it only looks like Meadows. He's wearing one of
these things on his arm. <br>
COMMANDANT: Very well, do as he asks. <br>
MEADOWS 2: But sir, this is ridiculous. <br>
COMMANDANT: We all have to help in this, Meadows. Roll up your sleeve. <br>

MEADOWS 2: Don't touch it! <br>

questions, and in return, I promise no harm will come to you. Do you
understand? <br>
MEADOWS 2: All right. <br>
DOCTOR: Where are your planes taking all their passengers? <br>
MEADOWS 2: There's a satellite about a hundred and fifty miles up. <br>
DOCTOR: Why are you abducting all these young people? <br>
MEADOWS 2: We had a catastrophe on our planet. A gigantic explosion. As
you've seen, we have lost our identities. My people are dying out. <br>
COMMANDANT: But what use would our people be to you? <br>
MEADOWS 2: Our scientists devised a process so that we could take on
the physical
characteristics of another being. <br>
DOCTOR: This is part of the process? <br>
MEADOWS 2: Yes, that's why you mustn't touch it. <br>
DOCTOR: How many of these young people do you hope to abduct? <br>
MEADOWS 2: This time, fifty thousand. <br>
COMMANDANT: Fifty thousand! <br>
DOCTOR: How large is this satellite? <br>
MEADOWS 2: On the journey in our planes, the passengers are
miniaturised. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. How many of your people are working here at Gatwick
Airport? <br>
MEADOWS 2: I don't know. That's the truth, I tell you. I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well. What happens to the people whose identity has been
taken over, the originals? <br>
MEADOWS 2: They're somewhere in the airport. I don't know exactly
where. <br>
COMMANDANT: I'll have the whole place torn to pieces to find them. <br>
MEADOWS 2: No, you mustn't find them. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
MEADOWS: You, you mustn't, that's all. <br>
DOCTOR: Because if we do find them, we'll find one of these on their
arms, eh? And if we remove it, something terrible will happen to you? <br>
MEADOWS 2: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: What if you have to change back? <br>
MEADOWS 2: Well, that can be done, but with the machine. <br>
DOCTOR: The machine in the Medical Centre? <br>
MEADOWS 2: Yes. None of us know where our own originals are, except
that Nurse. <br>
DOCTOR: Nurse? What about her? <br>
MEADOWS 2: Oh she was cunning. She's got her own original with her. <br>
DOCTOR: Where is it? <br>
MEADOWS 2: I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you do know. Now, are you going to tell me? <br>
MEADOWS 2: It's in the Medical Centre. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, you're going to show me where it is. <br>
MEADOWS 2: I daren't. She'll have me destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you going to co-operate or are you not? <br>
(Two policemen enter.) <br>
MEADOWS 2: All right. It won't make any difference. You'll never see
those fifty thousand young people again. <br>

have an interest. Will you confirm? <br>
COMMANDANT: Yes, we have that property. <br>

COMMANDANT: Does that matter. The important thing is we have found it,
and can now destroy you. <br>
