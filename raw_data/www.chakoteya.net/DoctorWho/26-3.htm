worry about looking silly. <br>
ACE: If this is a top secret naval camp, then I'm Lord Nelson. <br>

Dilemma, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Based on a false premise, don't you think, <i>like all
zero sum games</i>, but a neat algorithm nevertheless, Doctor
Judson. Excuse me, do you have any official stationery and a typewriter
I could use? <br>
JUDSON: On the desk. <br>

filing cabinet.) <br>
JUDSON: Put it down, child. It's not a toy. <br>
ACE: I know it's not. It's a flip-flop thingy. We used them at school. <br>
JUDSON: You understand it? <br>
ACE: Yeah, it's a logic game, isn't it? You drop marbles in the top,
and depending on what colour each window is, the marble follows a
different path. You've got a logic diagram for it on the blackboard. <br>
JUDSON: This is extraordinary! And you learnt about logic at school? <br>
ACE: Mmm, Miss Birkett taught us in computer studies. She was well
good. Can I borrow this? <br>

DOCTOR: Ah, thank you. <br>

fresh War Office headed paper, which says Sir, this is to authorise the
entry of the Doctor and his assistant Ace into the naval camp. The
signatures are those of Winston Churchill PM and somebody Menzies.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we are. Come in. <br>
(There is a knock at the door. Bates enters.) <br>
BATES: I'm sorry to disturb you sir, but these two are unauthorised
personnel. <br>
DOCTOR: Unauthorised? We are here by urgent request of the War Office.
I think you'll find this is signed by the Prime Minister and the head
of the Secret Service. <br>
(The Doctor hands Captain Bates his fresh forgery.) <br>
BATES: I must apologise, sir. We weren't informed of your arrival. <br>
DOCTOR: Need to know, Captain, need to know. Doctor Judson's work at
trying to break the German codes is very important to the war effort. <br>
BATES: (to Ace) We thought you were something to do with those East End
kids. Evacuees. <br>
ACE: I'm not from the East End, I'm from <br>
JUDSON: Perhaps you'd like to see the Ultima machine? <br>
DOCTOR: The Ultima machine? Yes. <br>
JUDSON: Ah, Bates, go and fetch Commander Millington, will you? <br>
BATES: Sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Commander? Well, on second thoughts, it's been a tiring day.
Perhaps tomorrow, Doctor Judson. If you'll just show us to our
quarters, we'd be grateful. Thank you.

up. <br>

SORIN: It only needs one. <br>
PETROSSIAN: Will you listen to me? There's evil here. Can't you feel it
cold against your skin. <br>
SORIN: Stop it! More stupid Armenian superstitions. You're supposed to
be a soldier. <br>
PETROSSIAN: So was he. <br>
SORIN: You follow orders. <br>
(Gayev is still alive, but shaking. Down on the shoreline, in the
gloom, Petrossian finds the oilskin pouch and slits it open with his
knife. Inside is a photograph of Doctor Judson and a map.)

WAINWRIGHT: I don't think that right is on anyone's side in war, Miss
Hardaker. <br>
HARDAKER: Your father would turn in his grave to hear such words. When
he was vicar of this parish, there was respect for the Good Book. <br>

HARDAKER: In plain language, doubt and indecision. <br>

ACE: They look like Viking carvings. <br>
DOCTOR: Viking rune stones. Ninth century, yes? <br>
JUDSON: Ah, you evidently know more than I do.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's the alphabet. The later Vikings used a sixteen
character alphabet. <br>
JUDSON: Don't tell me. The Ultima machine can break the most
sophisticated Nazi ciphers. Some ninth century scribbling shouldn't be
much of a problem. <br>

they'd put up the headstone. Joseph Sundvik. He must be one of the

World, where you first met the girl. <br>

I'd have chosen a social misfit if I hadn't known? She couldn't even
pass her chemistry exams at school, and yet she manages to create a
time storm in her bedroom. I saw your hand in it from the very
beginning. <br>
