bishop to Kings Rook 3.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Check. I said, check. <br>
TEGAN: I heard you. <br>
(Tegan is leaning on the console while the Doctor does some work
underneath. The lights are dimmed.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Come on, then. <br>
TEGAN: In a minute. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! <br>
TEGAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Interesting. It isn't a leak. <br>
TEGAN: It must be. We're losing power all the time. <br>
DOCTOR: No, our power's being tapped somehow. <br>
TEGAN: Tapped? What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It's just draining away. I don't understand. <br>
TURLOUGH: He never does. I'm sure it's something quite simple. <br>
TEGAN: You're being very calm about it. <br>
TURLOUGH: Your move. <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN [OC]: Move. Move. Move. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, did you say something? <br>
TURLOUGH: No. Just that it was Tegan's move. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, er, we'll block the outlet there. For a while we'll
just have to run on reduced power. <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN [OC]: Power. Power. Power. <br>
TEGAN: What's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Quiet. I'm trying to listen to something. <br>
TEGAN: To what? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not quite sure. It must have been my imagination. <br>
(The light flickers then gets darker.) <br>
TURLOUGH: There is something going on. <br>
DOCTOR: That's it! Of course, a message. Turn up the power. <br>
TEGAN: Turn it up? We're supposed to be conserving it. <br>
DOCTOR: Power. <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN: Here. Here. Here. <br>
DOCTOR: We must increase energy output. Now, push that lever to full. <br>
TEGAN: Are you sure everything's all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. Now, keep it at full, whatever happens. <br>
TEGAN: If we keep it at full, we'll lose power completely. <br>
(The Doctor runs into the interior.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Can you hear me? <br>
TEGAN: I suppose the Doctor must know what he's doing. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: We're giving you more power. <br>
TURLOUGH: You think so? He's out there talking to himself. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Where are you? </font></p>

is you, isn't it? <br>
(A figure wearing a white chicken on his head starts to appear. He is
trying to speak.) <br>
DOCTOR: I can't hear you. <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN: Power. At risk. There is extreme danger. I repeat <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Go on. <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN: Galactic north six degrees nine zero <br>
TEGAN [OC]: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Quiet! Keep back. Stay in the console room. Nine zero. <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN: Seven, seven. Go immediately. Not allow. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Not allow what? <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN: Death. Death. Death. <br>
BLACK GUARDIAN: You cannot succeed. I control the game, the Doctor's
destiny. And soon, he will be dead. Bwahahahahaha! <br>
(Both Guardians vanish and the lights come back on full.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: What have you done? You've reduced the
power! <br>
(The Doctor runs in.) <br>
TURLOUGH: We were about to blow up! <br>
DOCTOR: Never, ever, disobey my instructions again. <br>
TURLOUGH: I thought we were going to be killed. <br>
DOCTOR: And because of you, many others might die. <br>
TEGAN: Who were you talking to? <br>
DOCTOR: The White Guardian. <br>
TEGAN: The White Guardian? Who's he? <br>
DOCTOR: I've no time to explain. I have to sort out these coordinates. <br>
TEGAN: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I lost contact before I could get more
information. <br>
TEGAN: Well, what are we supposed to do when we get there? <br>
DOCTOR: Prevent something happening, something dangerous. <br>
TEGAN: What? You don't know that, either. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but when the White Guardian says there's danger, he's
invariably right. <br>
(The Tardis lurches, sending the chess board and everyone flying.) <br>
TEGAN: Now what's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: Time override. Locking must have been in the coordinates. We're
here. <br>
(The scanner shows blackness.) <br>
TURLOUGH: The air is breathable. <br>
TEGAN: Are you going out there? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I have to find out what's going on. Turlough, get a
couple of torches. <br>
TEGAN: Make it three. I'm coming with you. <br>
DOCTOR: No. I need you here. <br>
TEGAN: Why does it have to be me? <br>
DOCTOR: The White Guardian may try and make contact again. <br>
TURLOUGH: Er, I'll stay, if you like. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I need someone I can rely on. It's important. <br>
TEGAN: Someone who doesn't run away. <br>
TURLOUGH: I explained what happened on Terminus. <br>
DOCTOR: Save the arguing until later. <br>
TEGAN: What do I have to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Operate this lever. His power's badly depleted. He's having to
draw on ours to get through at all. <br>
TEGAN: The power drain is the White Guardian? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. <br>
TEGAN: Well, what did he say? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, apart from the coordinates, I could understand very
little. <br>
TEGAN: Well, shouldn't you wait? He might try to make contact again. <br>
DOCTOR: No, there may not be time. <br>
TEGAN: But anything could be out there. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and going out is the only way to learn what it is. <br>
(Turlough hands the Doctor a chunky torch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you ready? <br>
TEGAN: Well, what if the White Guardian tells me something important? <br>
DOCTOR: Thank him politely. Won't be long. <br>
TEGAN: Good luck. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There are sounds of creaking timbers, and
possibly water.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Wood. We're in a building. <br>
(Eek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. Rats. <br>
(They find a couple of trunks with Striker painted on them.) <br>
TURLOUGH: A warehouse? Do you feel that? Can't you feel it? The
ground's moving. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so. Look at this. <br>
TURLOUGH: A piece of rope. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Look again. <br>
TURLOUGH: Tar. <br>
DOCTOR: We're on a ship. A sailing ship. The hold, probably. <br>
TURLOUGH: I thought there was supposed to be great danger? <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't know you were so keen to find it. Down. <br>
(A figure enters carrying an oil lamp, moves around then leaves again.)
<br>
TURLOUGH: What was all that about? <br>
DOCTOR: Checking the stores. <br>
TURLOUGH: Did you see the expression on his face? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, almost as though he were hypnotised. Still, at least he
didn't find the Tardis. Come on. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan is gathering up the scattered chess pieces.
Behind her back, a pair of hands reach up on the scanner, and the
lights start to dim again.) <br>
TEGAN: White Guardian. <br>
(She goes to the power lever.) <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN: More. More. More. <br>
(The face of a man in Edwardian naval dress appears on the scanner. <br>
(The Doctor and Turlough go up a staircase from the hold and put the
torches on a shelf before opening a door.) <br>
TEGAN: Come on, where are you? <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN: You. You. You. <br>
TEGAN: Please hurry. Your demand for energy is causing an overload.
Quickly, the message. <br>
WHITE GUARDIAN: Must not win. Tell the Doctor. Winner takes all. All.
All. <br>
(The console starts a series of explosions. Tegan sees the face on the
scanner.) <br>
TEGAN: Who are you? The White Guardian? <br>
(The face smiles.) <br>
TEGAN: Who are you? <br>
(The face suddenly falls backwards with a cry.) <br>
TEGAN: Oh, no. </font></p>

from one of them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not bad. <br>
TURLOUGH: Are you insane? Let's get out of here. <br>
DOCTOR: Gently, Turlough. This one will do for me, you can take that
one. <br>
TURLOUGH: What do you think you're doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Behaving as if we've just joined the crew. Edwardian England. <br>
TURLOUGH: Oh, no, we're on Earth again. <br>
DOCTOR: So it seems. <br>
(The newspaper is dated September 7, 1902) <br>
DOCTOR: First British submarine launched. <br>
TURLOUGH: Why don't they say something? <br>
DOCTOR: They're sizing us up. Fo'c'sle's fairly cramped. It's important
to know who you're sharing it with. After all, we could be cooped up
here together for months. <br>
TURLOUGH: You're not serious. <br>
DOCTOR: Only if we're both here for the trip. <br>
TURLOUGH: Look, shouldn't we get back to the Tardis while there's still
a chance? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I must find out why the White Guardian wanted me to come
here. <br>
TURLOUGH: It was a mistake. They may be a rough lot, but they hardly
threaten the peace and harmony of the universe, do they? <br>

COLLIER: (amongst general cheers) Thank Gawd for that. <br>
DOCTOR: You've been expecting me? <br>
JACKSON: More than expecting you, slush, we've been waiting for you.
Where you been, eh? I mean, we've been living on nothing but hard tack
since we come aboard, haven't we, lads? <br>
ALL: Yeah, right. <br>
JACKSON: Get us some proper food, that's what we want. <br>

COLLIER: Dunno. Can't remember. Why'd you ask? <br>
DOCTOR: Curious. <br>
COLLIER: Truth of the matter is, we don't rightly remember. Probably
drank too much. <br>
DOCTOR: Celebrating your last night ashore. <br>
COLLIER: Yeah, but he don't drink. <br>
JACKSON: No, I signed a pledge. Ain't touched a drop since, but I don't
remember nothing neither. <br>

COLLIER: Yeah. And we got a month's wages in advance. Not likely to
forget that, now, would we? <br>

COLLIER: Slim bows. <br>
JACKSON: No, no. You give me a ship that's bluff in the bow and narrow
in the stern. <br>
COLLIER: Oh, yeah. Or a woman, cod head and mackerel tail. <br>
JACKSON: None of your flying ships. What, you been at the bottle, have
you, lad? Little bit of Dutch courage, eh? Now that's no good for a
green hand. <br>
GROGAN: That's right. <br>
JACKSON: And it's no good for us older hands either. Now, you've got to
keep a clear head if you're going up there. <br>
COLLIER: Yeah, and strong arms. Otherwise you're down on the deck from
the height of the crosstree, splat. <br>
JACKSON: Keep hold of those shrouds and make certain you get the
lifeline under your feet. You use your eyes and check that rigging
before you go up there. <br>

DOCTOR: You're unharmed? Did the White Guardian make contact again? <br>
TEGAN: It was very confused. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, tell me everything you can remember. <br>
TEGAN: Well, he was insistent somebody or something must not win the
race. Tell the Doctor, he said, winner takes all. <br>
