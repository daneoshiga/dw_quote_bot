K9: Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. I want you to set a course of binary coordinates ten

K9: Coordinates laid in. <br>
DOCTOR: Very good. <br>
K9: Spatial drive initiated. <br>
DOCTOR: Well done, K9. Well, now we've dropped off our Earth friend we
can be on our way. <br>
ROMANA: You've made up your mind, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. We can't resist a summons to Gallifrey. Anyway, I'm so
looking forward to seeing how Leela and Andred are getting on. You can
meet your twin, K9. You know Romana, it. Romana? <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. Well, you only came to help with the Key to Time. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, I don't want to spend the rest of my life on Gallifrey.
After all this. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you can't fight Time Lords, Romana. <br>
ROMANA: You did, once. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. And lost. <br>

K9: All component parts are functioning normally, master. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't believe it. I don't believe it! All component parts
functioning normally, ha! Pah. You mean to tell me that after all we've
been through, the systems are functioning perfectly? <br>
K9: Not perfectly, Master, adverb attributed was normally. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
ROMANA: We've materialised. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed we have. Let's take a look, shall we? <br>
(The scanner shows a plain brown landscape.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The wilderness of outer Gallifrey. Ready to go? <br>
ROMANA: I suppose so. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, it's not the end of the universe. We're home. <br>
ROMANA: Sorry. <br>

VARSH: That was close. <br>
TYLOS: Easy, Varsh. You said it would be easy. <br>
VARSH: All right, Tylos <br>
TYLOS: It's not all right. <br>
KEARA: Look. Down there. <br>

DOCTOR: But it's absurd. It's just absurd. <br>
K9: Master. <br>
ROMANA: What are we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we can't take off until we find out precisely what's
wrong with the Tardis. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Dexeter is using tweezers to examine the 'seeds'
of the river plants.) <br>
DRAITH: They seem to be moving. <br>
DEXETER: It's the same sign noted fifty years ago by Corellis and Dell.
They postulated that they might be eggs of some kind. <br>
DRAITH: Insect eggs? <br>
DEXETER: Perhaps. Unfamiliar insect life is supposed to precede each
incident. <br>
DRAITH: Yes, it's true. <br>
DEXETER: Can you confirm this? Is it mentioned in the System Files? <br>
DRAITH: You overreach yourself, Dexeter. <br>
DEXETER: Forgive me, Decider, but if there is some way we can let
science illuminate your inner knowledge, you <br>
DRAITH: I cannot discuss the System Files. Sometimes I wish I could
share it with someone, but I too must obey the Procedure. <br>
DEXETER: Of course, Decider.

teenagers have a visitor, another young lad. Everyone say Hi to Matthew
Waterhouse.) <br>
VARSH: So, you want to be an Outler. <br>
ADRIC: I'm serious. <br>
TYLOS: Nobody joins unless we all agree. <br>
VARSH: You belong in the Starliner, Adric. <br>
KEARA: Ask him the Embarkation Question. <br>
TYLOS: Yes, go on. <br>
VARSH: When the Starliner leaves Alzarius, were will you be? <br>
ADRIC: Not here. <br>
TYLOS: You see? <br>
KEARA: He'll be in the Starliner. <br>
TYLOS: If it ever does take off. <br>
ADRIC: It will! <br>
TYLOS: He believes all that stuff <br>
ADRIC: It will take off. But I won't be on it. <br>
KEARA: And you won't be on Alzarius either? <br>
ADRIC: I don't know. I'll be somewhere else. <br>
TYLOS: Daydreamer. <br>
ADRIC: I'm sorry, I just can't explain. <br>
KEARA: He belongs in the Great Hall of Books with all the other
dreamers. <br>
TYLOS: Anyway, we said no Elites. Unless you want to make special rules
for your brother? <br>
VARSH: We've broken all family ties. <br>
ADRIC: But I don't expect special treatment. <br>
KEARA: Don't you? Isn't that what the star's for? <br>
(The blue star on Adric's jacket pocket.) <br>
ADRIC: That is for mathematical excellence. <br>
KEARA: So the boy can count. Give it to me. <br>
(Adric grabs Keara's arm and twists it behind her back.) ADRIC: Keep
your hands off it! <br>
KEARA: Let go! <br>
ADRIC: And don't tell me what to do. I've had enough orders in the
Starliner. Can't you keep these two under better control? <br>
KEARA: He talks like a Decider already. <br>
TYLOS: He's no better than we are. <br>
ADRIC: Of course I'm better than you. I'm an Elite. <br>
VARSH: That won't help you outside the Starliner when you're struggling
to stay alive. <br>
ADRIC: It's you people who talk like Deciders. <br>
KEARA: What? <br>
ADRIC: I mean, you can't even steal a few river fruits. <br>
TYLOS: I'd like to see you try. <br>
ADRIC: All right. <br>
VARSH: Go back to the Starliner, Adric. <br>
TYLOS: No. If your little brother really wants to prove himself <br>
VARSH: They'll be guarding the fruits now. It's too dangerous for us. <br>
TYLOS: We don't have badges for mathematical excellence. You know what
this is? <br>
(Tylos holds up a piece of plaited twine, with decorations laced into
it.) <br>
TYLOS: It's our badge. It has to be earned. <br>
ADRIC: Right.

NEFRED: If this is Mistfall <br>
DEXETER: I hope so, Decider Nefred. Scientifically. <br>
GARIF: You're too young to remember the last one, Dexeter, but it's not
something I look forward to. <br>
NEFRED: Nor I. <br>
GARIF: Nor Decider Draith, I'm sure. <br>
DEXETER: Decider Draith. I must get back to him. <br>
NEFRED: I was a boy the last time the mists came. Horrible. Horrible. <br>
(The Deciders leave. Dexeter reads from a small notebook.) <br>
DEXETER: A kind of spider. Incomprehensible lifeform. Infectious.

OMRIL: Dexeter again. What's going on? <br>
RYSIK: I told you something was up. I told you. <br>
(Meanwhile, the teenagers are watching from the forest as Adric swims
across the lake. He reaches the shore by the stockpile of fruits and
creeps ashore. Then steam and bubbles start to form in the lake. The
adults gather to look. The Decider pushes through them.) <br>
DRAITH: Let me through. Make way. <br>
(The water seems to be almost boiling.) <br>
DRAITH: Indeed. Mistfall! <br>
(General consternation. The two swimmers start struggling in the
water.) <br>
SWIMMER: Help me! Help us! <br>
DRAITH: In the water! <br>
OMRIL: Come on, let's get them. <br>
(The two men drag the swimmers out. They are actually wearing
loinclothes. Shame.) <br>
DRAITH: Citizens! Citizens. Citizens! As First Decider and Keeper of
the System Files, I must announce to you the coming of Mistfall. <br>
(Everyone gasps in horror.) <br>
DRAITH: There is no need to be alarmed as long as you all follow the
Procedure. We have two hours. <br>
(The people start to gather up their baskets and rugs, and leave. Adric
sneaks over to the pile and picks up three fruits. He is spotted.) <br>
DRAITH: Adric! <br>

by the shore.) </font></p>

amonst the mist. Draith goes up help to him.) <br>
DRAITH: Adric! Come on, they're closing the Starliner. Come on. <br>
(Draith pulls Adric to his feet.) <br>
DRAITH: Come on, come on. <br>

where he lies motionless.)

GARIF: Your daughter? <br>

NEFRED: She and the other Outlers chose to leave us, Login. <br>
GARIF: The doors must close. <br>

NEFRED: And you, Login, are a greatly valued citizen, but we cannot
change the law for you. <br>

DOCTOR: What's wrong with what? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, the console, the scanner. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that. Yes, that recurring image of Gallifrey. Well, it's
something really quite simple. The image translator reads the absolute

negative coordinates. Doctor, that disruption we came through. <br>

GARIF: The system files, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
LOGIN: And this is the flight manual. I've heard of it, but I've never
seen it. <br>
GARIF: The pages referring to takeoff were damaged in the crash. <br>
DOCTOR: Shhh. Ready? Thrusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. <br>
ROMANA: Ground hold disengage. <br>
DOCTOR: Got it. <br>
ROMANA: Then it's just ignition. <br>
DOCTOR: Which is that button there, gentlemen. <br>
ROMANA: The manual is readable from there on. <br>
DOCTOR: Have a good flight gentleman! <br>
GARIF: Doctor! <br>

GARIF: Doctor, come back! <br>
DOCTOR: The green button gentleman! <br>
GARIF: Such a momentous decision! <br>

ROMANA: You, a Decider? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I decided not too. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, what did happen while I was unconscious? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Adric and I were too busy to think about you. <br>
ROMANA: Hmm. Adric's left us a present. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? An Image Translator! Loot! He stole that. Still It
might come in useful. <br>
ROMANA: It works! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes unfortunately. <br>
ROMANA: Negative coordinates. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes that settles it. We're out of our own time and space,
Romana. <br>
ROMANA: Exo-space? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. What I think we came through was a Charged Vacuum
Emboitment. <br>
ROMANA: A CVE. <br>
DOCTOR Hmmm. One of the rarest Space-Time events in the universe. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, look. The Starliner is taking off. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they made a decision. <br>
ROMANA: And we're trapped. Unless we can find another CVE. <br>
