<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Strax the Sontaran Butler is putting handcuffs on
a man.) <br>
STRAX: Prepare for obliteration, Earthling scum. <br>
INSPECTOR: Actually, Mister Strax, if you could just take him aside for
a moment, I have some officers on the way. <br>
STRAX: As you wish. Humans. <br>
JENNY: Sorry. He is new. <br>
INSPECTOR: Funny looking fellow but, Turkish, is he? <br>
VASTRA: He is a genetically modified clone warrior from outer space. <br>
INSPECTOR: Ah. Makes sense. Well, what a case. Identical twins, poison
undetectable to science, an ancient Egyptian curse. Once more Scotland
Yard is in your debt, Madame Vastra. Where would we be without you? <br>
VASTRA: Quite some distance from a clue, one imagines. <br>
INSPECTOR: You might be right. Does it ever hurt? <br>
VASTRA: Does what hurt? <br>
INSPECTOR: Your skin condition. Always wondered. <br>
JENNY: It's not a condition, Inspector. It's just skin. <br>
INSPECTOR: Are you sure? <br>
VASTRA: I am, as I may have failed to mention, an intelligent reptile
from an ancient civilisation long preceding mankind. Many of us slumber
under the Earth's crust. <br>
JENNY: Madame was accidentally awoken by an extension to the London
Underground. <br>
INSPECTOR: Well, that would account for it. <br>
VASTRA: I was not initially keen on the society of apes, but I made the
most elementary of errors. I fell in love. <br>
(Vastra and Jenny gaze into each others eyes.) <br>
INSPECTOR: What, with the Turkish fellow? <br>
VASTRA: No. Not with the Turkish fellow. <br>
INSPECTOR: Good lord. Good lord. <br>
VASTRA: Come along, my dear. <br>
JENNY: Yes, my darling. <br>
INSPECTOR: Good lord.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JENNY: Still no word from the Doctor, then? <br>
VASTRA: No, my dear. And there won't be. <br>
JENNY: He can't sulk in his box forever. <br>
VASTRA: Heartbreak is a burden to us all. Pity the man with two. <br>
JENNY: It's starting to snow. <br>
VASTRA: But it can't be. <br>
JENNY: Well, it is nearly Christmas. <br>
VASTRA: But the clouds. <br>
JENNY: What about them? <br>
VASTRA: There aren't any. </font> </p>
