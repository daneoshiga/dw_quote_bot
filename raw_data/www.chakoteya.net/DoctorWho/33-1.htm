in a tea room when he sees a cloaked figure with no visible face
sitting across the
room. No one else notices. Then it is sitting opposite him.) <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think I asked you to sit. <br>
FIGURE: There is a woman who wants to meet you. <br>
DOCTOR: That's nice, but I'm married. <br>
FIGURE: Your help is required. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't discuss my business in public. <br>
FIGURE: I know. <br>
(A wave of the hand, and they are the only people in the tea room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? <br>
FIGURE: A messenger. <br>
DOCTOR: Whose messenger? <br>
FIGURE: Darla von Karlsen. <br>
DOCTOR: Never heard of her. <br>
(He stands up. The location has changed.) <br>
DOCTOR: Where's the tea room? <br>
FIGURE: You were never in the tea room. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Of course. Psychic projection. Someone's sending me a dream
message. Well, I hope I fell asleep somewhere comfy. <br>
FIGURE: Do you recognise where you are? <br>
(Children's laughter off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Can't remember. How do you hang up on this thing? <br>
FIGURE: You can't. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yeah? And what if I just wake up? <br>
(In a deckchair on a beach.) <br>
FIGURE: No, Doctor. The beach isn't real either. You are still
dreaming. <br>
(In space.) <br>
FIGURE: Spacetime coordinates. You will meet Darla von Karlsen here.
Her daughter is in danger, and only you can save her. You recognise the
planet? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
FIGURE: Say it. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
FIGURE: Name the planet. <br>
DOCTOR: I will not say that name. <br>
FIGURE: Say it. <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
(The Doctor wakes up underneath the time rotor.) <br>
FIGURE [OC]: Name the planet. Name the planet. Name the planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Skaro. </i>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A scene of utter devastation and persisting
rainfall. We pan around a giant Dalek statue covered in mould and
mess.) <br>
DARLA [OC]: First, there were the Daleks. And then, there was a man who
fought them. And then, in time, he died. There are a few, of course,
who believe this man somehow survived, and that one day he will return.
For both our sakes, dearest Hannah, we must hope these stories are
true. <br>
(A robed figure wearing high heels turns to a shadow with the profile
of the Doctor walking inside the eyepiece of the statue.) <br>
DOCTOR: I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send me
messages. <br>
DARLA: I have a daughter, Hannah. She's in a Dalek prison camp. They
say you can help. <br>
DOCTOR: Do they? I wish they'd stop. I love your choice of meeting
place. <br>
DARLA: They said I'd have to intrigue you. <br>
DOCTOR: Skaro. The original planet of the Daleks. Look at the state of
it. Who told you about me? <br>
DARLA: Does it matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe not, but you're very well informed. If Hannah's in a
Dalek prison camp, tell me, why aren't you? <br>
DARLA: I escaped. <br>
DOCTOR: (chuckles) No. Nobody escapes the Dalek camps. You're very
cold. <br>
DARLA: What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a trap. <br>
DARLA: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: You are, and you don't even know it. <br>
(The Doctor backs away as a Dalek eyepiece comes out of her forehead,
then a gun out of her right palm. He is shot, and a Dalek saucer
appears in the sky.) <br>

RORY: Really? Thought you were just pouting at a camera. <br>
AMY: Rory? <br>
(Rory leaves and Cassandra the make-up artist enters. One of the bulbs
on the make up dresser is flashing.) <br>
CASSANDRA: Sorry, love. Was I interrupting? <br>
AMY: No. <br>
CASSANDRA: Gosh, look at you. You've gone so pale. Come on, take a

eyepiece grows from his forehead. The bus is filled with white light.) <br>

Amy is standing nearby.) <br>
RORY: Where are we? <br>

Dalek saucers outside.) <br>
RORY: So how much trouble are we in? <br>
(The door opens and a Dalek enters.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: How much trouble, Mister Pond? <br>
(The Doctor enters, under escort.) <br>
DOCTOR: Out of ten? Eleven. <br>

tiers around them, and the White Supreme Dalek nearby, along with an
organic Dalek and the Tardis.) <br>
AMY: Where are we? A spaceship, right? <br>
DOCTOR: Not just any spaceship. The Parliament of the Daleks. Be brave.
<br>
AMY: What do we do? <br>
DOCTOR: Make them remember you. Well, come on then. You've got me. What
are you waiting for? At long last, it's Christmas! Here I am. <br>
(The Doctor closes his eyes tight, expecting to die. The organic Dalek
speaks.) <br>
DALEK PM: Save us. You will save us. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll what? <br>
DALEK: You will save the Daleks. <br>
DALEKS: Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A musical box plays Carmen as a young brunette
nails planks over the round window. It is a neat room with a hammock
and a microwave.) <br>
OSWIN [OC]: Day three six three. The terror continues. Also, made
another soufflé, very nearly. Check defences. They came again last
night. Still always at night. Maybe they're vampires. Oh, and it's my
mum's birthday. Happy birthday, mum. <br>
OSWIN: I did make you a soufflé, but it was too beautiful to live. <br>
DALEK [OC]: You will let us enter! We will enter! We will enter! <br>
(She turns up the volume on Carmen. Toreador blasts out.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Parliament]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RORY: What's he doing? <br>
AMY: He's chosen the most defendable area in the room, counted all the
Daleks, counted all the exits, and now he's calculating the exact
distance we're standing apart and starting to worry. Oh, and look at
him frowning now. <br>
(Dalek Darla is there.) <br>
AMY: Something's wrong with Amy and Rory, and who's going to fix it?
And he straightens his bow tie. <br>
DALEK PM: We have arrived. <br>
DOCTOR: Arrived where? <br>
DALEK PM: Doctor. <br>
DARLA: The Prime Minister will speak with you now. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you remember who you were before they emptied you out and
turned you into their puppet? <br>
DARLA: My memories are only reactivated if they are required to
facilitate cover or disguise. <br>
DOCTOR: You had a daughter. <br>
DARLA: I know. I've read my file. <br>
(The Doctor walks up to the Prime Minister, who is the organic Dalek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well? <br>
DALEK PM: What do you know of the Dalek Asylum? <br>
DOCTOR: According to legend, you have a dumping ground. A planet where
you lock up all the Daleks that go wrong. The battle-scarred, the
insane, the ones even you can't control. It's never made any sense to
me. <br>
DALEK PM: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you'd just kill them. <br>
DALEK PM: It is offensive to us to extinguish such divine hatred. <br>
DOCTOR: Offensive? <br>
DALEK PM: Does it surprise you to know the Daleks have a concept of
beauty? <br>
DOCTOR: I thought you'd run out of ways to make me sick. Hello again.
You think hatred is beautiful. <br>
DALEK PM: Perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you. <br>
(A hole opens in the middle of the floor. The Doctor and Darla walk
back to it. A planet is visible.) <br>
DARLA: The Asylum. It occupies the entire planet, right to the core. <br>
DOCTOR: How many Daleks are in there? <br>
DARLA: A count has not been made. Millions, certainly. <br>
DOCTOR: All still alive? <br>
DARLA: It has to be assumed. The Asylum is fully automated. Supervision
is not required. <br>
AMY: Armed? <br>
DARLA: The Daleks are always armed. <br>
RORY: What colour? I'm sorry, there weren't any good questions left. <br>
DARLA: This signal is being received from the very heart of the Asylum.
<br>
(Carmen comes over the speakers.) <br>
WHITE: What is the noise? Explain. Explain. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, it's me. <br>
RORY: Sorry, what? <br>
DOCTOR: It's me, playing the triangle. Okay, I got buried in the mix.
Carmen. Lovely show. Someone's transmitting this. Have you considered
tracking back the signal and talking to them? He asked the Daleks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Because a starliner has crashed into your
Asylum, and someone's got in. And if someone can get in, then
everything can get out. A tsunami of insane Daleks. Even you don't want
that. <br>
WHITE: The Asylum must be cleansed. <br>
DOCTOR: Then why is it still here? You've enough firepower on this ship
to blast it out of the sky. <br>
DARLA: The Asylum forcefield is impenetrable. <br>
DOCTOR: Turn it off. <br>
DARLA: It can only be turned off from within the Asylum. <br>
DOCTOR: A small taskforce could sneak through a forcefield. Send in a
couple of Daleks. Oh. (applauds) Oh. Oh, that's good. That's brilliant.
You're all too scared to go down there. Not one of you will go, so tell
me, what do the Daleks do when they're too scared? <br>
WHITE: The Predator of the Daleks will be deployed. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't have a Predator, and even if you did, why would they
turn off a forcefield for you? <br>
DALEK PM: Because you will have no other means of escape. <br>
DARLA: May I clarify? The Predator is the Dalek's word for you. <br>
DOCTOR: Me? Me? <br>
DARLA: You will need this. It will protect you from the nanocloud. <br>
(Two humanoids put a wristband on the Doctor's wrist.) <br>
DOCTOR: The what? The nano what? <br>
DARLA: The gravity beam will convey you close to the source of the
transmission. You must find a way to deactivate the forcefield from
there. <br>
DOCTOR: You're going to fire me at a planet? That's your plan? I get
fired at a planet and expected to fix it. <br>
RORY: In fairness, that is slightly your M O. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't be fair to the Daleks when they're firing me at a planet.
<br>
(Rory and Amy have wristbands put on them, too.) <br>
DOCTOR: What do you want with them? <br>
WHITE: It is known the Doctor required companions. <br>
RORY: Oh, brilliant. Good oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry. We'll get through this, I promise. Don't be
scared. <br>

DOCTOR: They're dead. All of them. <br>
HARVEY: That's not possible. I just spoke to them. Two hours ago. We

(Harvey is backed through a door that Amy manages to get open, then
closes and locks again.) <br>
AMY: Explain. That's what you're good at. How'd he get all Daleked? <br>
DOCTOR: Because he wasn't wearing one of these. Oh, ho, ho. That's
clever. The nanocloud. Microorganisms that automatically process any
organic matter, living or dead, into a Dalek puppet. Anything attacks
this place, it automatically becomes part of the on-site security. <br>
AMY: Living or dead? <br>
