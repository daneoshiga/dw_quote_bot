MOON: I'm Doctor Moon. I've been treating you since you came here, two
years ago. <br>

didn't know you for a moment. <br>

feels like no time at all. <br>

MOON: Can I just say what a pleasure it is to see you fully integrated.

RIVER: OK, we've got a clear spot. In, in, in! Right in the centre. In
the middle of the light, quickly. Don't let your shadows cross. Doctor.
<br>
DOCTOR: I'm doing it. <br>
RIVER: There's no lights here. Sunset's coming. We can't stay long.
Have you found a live one? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe. It's getting harder to tell. What's wrong with you? <br>
RIVER: We're going to need a chicken leg. Who's got a chicken leg?
Thanks, Dave. <br>
(She throws the meat into the shadow, and once again it is just bone
before it hits the ground.) <br>
RIVER: Okay. Okay, we've got a hot one. Watch your feet. <br>
DOCTOR: They won't attack until there's enough of them. But they've got
our scent now. They're coming. <br>
OTHER DAVE: Oh, yeah, who is he? You haven't even told us. You just
expect us to trust him? <br>
RIVER: He's the Doctor. <br>
LUX: And who is the Doctor? <br>
RIVER: The only story you'll ever tell, if you survive him. <br>
ANITA: You say he's your friend, but he doesn't even know who you are. <br>
RIVER: Listen, all you need to know is this. I'd trust that man to the
end of the universe. And actually, we've been. <br>
ANITA: He doesn't act like he trusts you. <br>
RIVER: Yeah, there's a tiny problem. He hasn't met me yet. <br>
(She goes over to where the Doctor is still scanning shadows.) <br>
RIVER: What's wrong with it? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a signal coming from somewhere, interfering with it. <br>
RIVER: Then use the red settings. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't have a red setting. <br>
RIVER: Well, use the dampers. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't have dampers. <br>
RIVER: It will do one day. <br>
(The Doctor takes River's sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: So, some time in the future, I just give you my screwdriver. <br>
RIVER: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Why would I do that? <br>
RIVER: I didn't pluck it from your cold dead hands, if that's what
you're worried about. <br>
DOCTOR: And I know that because? <br>
RIVER: Listen to me. You've lost your friend. You're angry. I
understand. But you need to be less emotional, Doctor, right now. <br>
DOCTOR: Less emotional? I'm not emotional. <br>
RIVER: There are five people in this room still alive. Focus on that.
Dear God, you're hard work young. <br>
DOCTOR: Young? Who are you? <br>
LUX: Oh, for heaven's sake! Look at the pair of you. We're all going to
die right here, and you're just squabbling like an old married couple. <br>
RIVER: Doctor, one day I'm going to be someone that you trust
completely, but I can't wait for you to find that out. So I'm going to
prove it to you. And I'm sorry. I'm really very sorry. <br>
(River whispers in the Doctor's ear, and he looks stunned.) <br>
RIVER: Are we good? Doctor, are we good? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, we're good. <br>
RIVER: Good. <br>
(River takes back her screwdriver and leaves him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Know what's interesting about my screwdriver? Very hard to
interfere with. Practically nothing's strong enough. Well, some
hairdryers, but I'm working on that. So there is a very strong signal
coming from somewhere, and it wasn't there before. So what's new?
What's changed? Come on! What's new? What's different? <br>
DAVE 2: I don't know. Nothing. It's getting dark? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a screwdriver. It works in the dark. Moon rise. Tell me
about the moon. What's there? <br>
LUX: It's not real. It was built as part of the Library. It's just a
Doctor Moon. <br>
DOCTOR: What's a Doctor Moon? <br>
LUX: A virus checker. It supports and maintains the main computer at
the core of the planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, still active. It's signalling. Look. Someone somewhere in
this library is alive and communicating with the moon. Or, possibly
alive and drying their hair. No, the signal is definitely coming from
the moon. I'm blocking it, but it's trying to break through. <br>
(An image of Donna appears.) <br>
RIVER: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Donna! <br>
(Donna disappears again.) <br>
RIVER: That was her. That was your friend! Can you get her back? What
was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm trying to find the wavelength.
Argh, I'm being blocked. <br>
ANITA: Professor? <br>
RIVER: Just a moment. <br>
ANITA: It's important. I have two shadows. <br>
RIVER: Okay. Helmets on, everyone. Anita, I'll get yours. <br>
ANITA: It didn't do Proper Dave any good. <br>
RIVER: Just keep it together, okay? <br>
ANITA: Keeping it together. I'm only crying. I'm about to die. It's not
an overreaction. <br>
(River puts the helmet on Anita.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hang on. <br>
(The Doctor sonics the visor black.) <br>
RIVER: Oh God, they've got inside. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I just tinted her visor. Maybe they'll think
they're already in there, leave her alone. <br>
RIVER: Do you think they can be fooled like that? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe. I don't know. It's a swarm. It's not like we chat. <br>
OTHER DAVE: Can you still see in there? <br>
ANITA: Just about. <br>
DOCTOR: Just, just, just stay back. Professor, a quick word, please. <br>

off back to his Tardis and open the doors with a snap of his fingers.

you tell me this? I needed to know this! <br>
LUX: Because she's family! Cal. Charlotte Abigail Lux. My grandfather's
youngest daughter. She was dying, so he built her a library and put her
living mind inside, with a moon to watch over her, and all of human
history to pass the time. Any era to live in, any book to read. She
loved books more than anything, and he gave her them all. He asked only
that she be left in peace. A secret, not a freak show. <br>

just mention in passing as you're here, shut up. <br>

hard to make any kind of offer at all. You know what? I really liked
Anita. She was brave, even when she was crying. And she never gave in.

pass. <br>

DOCTOR: Why am I handcuffed? Why do you even have handcuffs? <br>
RIVER: Spoilers. <br>
DOCTOR: This is not a joke. Stop this now. This is going to kill you!
I'd have a chance, you don't have any. <br>
RIVER: You wouldn't have a chance, and neither do I. I'm timing it for
the end of the countdown. There'll be a blip in the command flow. That
way it should improve our chances of a clean download. <br>
DOCTOR: River, please. No. <br>
RIVER: Funny thing is, this means you've always known how I was going
to die. All the time we've been together, you knew I was coming here.
The last time I saw you, the real you, the future you, I mean, you
turned up on my doorstep, with a new haircut and a suit. You took me to
Darillium to see the Singing Towers. What a night that was. The Towers
sang, and you cried. <br>

okay. It's not over for you. You'll see me again. You've got all of
that to come. You and me, time and space. You watch us run. <br>

ever, for one moment, accepts it. <br>

think of a way to save her, and what he did was give her a screwdriver.
