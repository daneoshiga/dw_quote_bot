<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis lands in Roald Dahl Plass.) <br>
DOCTOR: Cardiff. <br>
MARTHA: Cardiff? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, but the thing about Cardiff, it's built on a rift in time
and space, just like California and the San Andreas Fault, but the rift
bleeds energy. Every now and then I need to open up the engines, soak
up the energy and use it as fuel. <br>
MARTHA: So it's a pit stop. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Should only take twenty seconds. The rift's been
active. <br>
(A man in a great coat is running across the plaza.) <br>
MARTHA: Wait a minute. They had an earthquake in Cardiff a couple of
years ago. Was that you? <br>
DOCTOR: Bit of trouble with the Slitheen. <br>
(It is Jack Harkness. He has a rucksack on his back.) <br>
DOCTOR: A long time ago. Lifetimes. I was a different man back then. </font></p>

(The Doctor sees Jack on the scanner. He sets the time rotor moving.
Jack leaps for the Tardis and something goes bang! on the console.) <br>
MARTHA: Whoa! What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: We're accelerating into the future. The year one billion. Five
billion. Five trillion. Fifty trillion? What? The year one hundred
trillion? That's impossible. <br>
MARTHA: Why? What happens then? <br>
DOCTOR: We're going to the end of the universe. </font></p>

out in front of him.) <br>
PADRA: I don't. I just want to go. Please, let me go. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The radar has a blip on the screen. A white haired
man notices it.) <br>
YANA: There's movement on the surface. Another human hunt. God help
him. <br>
(His blue female alien assistant is concerned.) <br>
CHANTHO: Chan should I alert the guards tho? <br>
YANA: No, no, we can't spare them. Poor beggar's on his own. One more
lost soul dreaming of Utopia. <br>
CHANTHO: Chan you mustn't talk as if you've given up tho. <br>
YANA: No, no, indeed. Here's to it. Utopia. <br>
(He takes a drink from a mug.) <br>
YANA: Where it is to be hoped the coffee is a little less sour. Will
you join me? <br>
CHANTHO: Chan I am happy drinking my own internal milk tho. <br>
YANA: Yes, well, that's quite enough information, thank you. <br>
(A man's voice comes over a loudspeaker up in the rafters.) <br>
ATILLO [OC]: Professor Yana? I don't want to rush you, but how are we
doing? <br>
YANA: Er, yes, er, er, yes. Working. Yes, almost there. <br>
ATILLO [OC]: How's it looking on the footprint? <br>
YANA: It's good. Yes. Fine. Excellent. <br>
CHANTHO: Chan there's no problem as such. We've accelerated the
calculation matrix but it's going to take time to harmonise tho. Chan
we're trying a new reversal process. We'll have a definite result in
approximately two hours tho. <br>
(Chantho's voice becomes fuzzy and the Professor hears a thumping sound
in his head, like a rhythmic drumbeat.) <br>
CHANTHO: Chan Professor tho? <br>
YANA: Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Working. <br>
CHANTHO: Chan it's the surface scanner, Professor. It seems to be
detecting up a different signal tho. <br>
YANA: Well, that's not a standard reading. I can't make it out. <br>
(Instead of the usual blip, there is a square on the screen.) <br>
YANA: It would seem something new has arrived.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Well, we've landed. <br>
MARTHA: So what's out there? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
MARTHA: Say that again. That's rare. <br>
DOCTOR: Not even the Time Lords came this far. We should leave. We
should go. We should really, really go. <br>
(Then he grins and runs to the door.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Okay, it's a quarry. Martha spots someone lying on
the ground near the Tardis.) <br>
MARTHA: Oh my God! <br>
(It is Jack.) <br>
MARTHA: Can't get a pulse. Hold on. You've got that medical kit thing. <br>
(She runs into the Tardis) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello again. Oh, I'm sorry. <br>
(Martha returns with the medical kit.) <br>
MARTHA: Here we go. Get out of the way. It's a bit odd, though. Not
very hundred trillion. That coat's more like World War Two. <br>
DOCTOR: I think he came with us. <br>
MARTHA: How do you mean, from Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: Must have been clinging to the outside of the Tardis all the
way through the vortex. Well, that's very him. <br>
MARTHA: What, do you know him? <br>
DOCTOR: Friend of mine. Used to travel with me, back in the old days. <br>
MARTHA: But he's. I'm sorry, there's no heartbeat. There's nothing.
He's dead. <br>
(Jack gasps and grabs Martha, who screams.) <br>
MARTHA: Oh, so much for me. It's all right. Just breathe deep. I've got
you. <br>
JACK: Captain Jack Harkness. And who are you? <br>
MARTHA: Martha Jones. <br>
JACK: Nice to meet you, Martha Jones. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't start. <br>
JACK: I was only saying hello. <br>
MARTHA: I don't mind. <br>
(She helps Jack stand up.) <br>
JACK: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Captain. <br>
JACK: Good to see you. <br>
DOCTOR: And you. Same as ever. Although, have you had work done? <br>
JACK: You can talk. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, the face. Regeneration. How did you know this was me? <br>
JACK: The police box kind of gives it away. I've been following you for
a long time. You abandoned me. <br>
DOCTOR: Did I? Busy life. Moving on. <br>
JACK: Just got to ask. The Battle of Canary Wharf. I saw the list of
the dead. It said Rose Tyler. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no! Sorry, she's alive. <br>
JACK: You're kidding. <br>
DOCTOR: Parallel world, safe and sound. And Mickey, and her mother. <br>
JACK: Oh, yes! <br>
(Jack hugs the Doctor.) <br>
MARTHA: Good old Rose. <br>
(Padra is still being chased as Jack and Martha, and the Doctor, walk
through some scrubland.) <br>
JACK: So there I was, stranded in the year two hundred one hundred,
ankle deep in Dalek dust, and he goes off without me. But I had this. <br>
(A sort of bracelet.) <br>
JACK: I used to be a Time Agent. It's called a vortex manipulator. He's
not the only one who can time travel. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, excuse me. That is not time travel. It's like, I've got a
sports car and you've got a space hopper. <br>
MARTHA: Oh ho. Boys and their toys. <br>
JACK: All right, so I bounced. I thought 21st century, the best place
to find the Doctor, except that I got it a little wrong. Arrived in
1869, this thing burnt out, so it was useless. <br>
DOCTOR: Told you. <br>
JACK: I had to live through the entire twentieth century waiting for a
version of you that would coincide with me. <br>
MARTHA: But that makes you more than one hundred years old. <br>
JACK: And looking good, don't you think? So I went to the time rift,
based myself there because I knew you'd come back to refuel. Until
finally I get a signal on this detecting you and here we are. <br>
MARTHA: But the thing is, how come you left him behind, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I was busy. <br>
MARTHA: Is that what happens, though, seriously? Do you just get bored
with us one day and disappear? <br>
JACK: Not if you're blonde. <br>
MARTHA: Oh, she was blonde? Oh, what a surprise! <br>
DOCTOR: You two! We're at the end of the universe, all right? Right at
the edge of knowledge itself and you're busy blogging! Come on. <br>
(They look down over a cliff onto a high tech construction of some
kind.) <br>
MARTHA: Is that a city? <br>
DOCTOR: A city or a hive, or a nest, or a conglomeration. Like it was
grown. But look, there. That's like pathways, roads? Must have been
some sort of life, long ago. <br>
MARTHA: What killed it? <br>
DOCTOR: Time. Just time. Everything's dying now. All the great
civilizations have gone. This isn't just night. All the stars have
burned up and faded away into nothing. <br>
JACK: They must have an atmospheric shell. We should be frozen to
death. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Martha and I, maybe. Not so sure about you, Jack. <br>
MARTHA: What about the people? Does no one survive? <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose we have to hope life will find a way. <br>
JACK: Well, he's not doing too bad. <br>
(The running man is dashing through the city, pursued by the tribe.) <br>
CHIEFTAIN: Human! <br>
DOCTOR: Is it me, or does that look like a hunt? Come on! <br>
(The Doctor, Jack and Martha run to help.) <br>
JACK: Oh, I've missed this. <br>
(They meet up with the running man.) <br>
JACK: I've got you. <br>
PADRA: They're coming! They're coming! <br>
(Jack aims a revolver at the tribes people.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jack, don't you dare! <br>
(Jack fires into the air, and the noise stops the tribe in its tracks.)
<br>
MARTHA: What the hell are they? <br>
PADRA: There's more of them. We've got to keep going. <br>
DOCTOR: I've got a ship nearby. It's safe. It's not far, it's over
there. <br>
(More tribesmen appear on the cliff.) <br>
DOCTOR: Or maybe not. <br>
PADRA: We're close to the silo. If we get to the silo, then we're safe.
<br>
DOCTOR: Silo? <br>
JACK: Silo. <br>
MARTHA: Silo for me.

PADRA: Show him your teeth. <br>
(Everyone grimaces, displaying their chisel incisors.) <br>
GUARD: Human! Let them in! Let them in! <br>
(The metal gates are opened and the trio run through.) <br>
GUARD: Close! Close! Close! <br>
(A guard fires his machine gun at the ground in front of the tribe as
they get too close.) <br>
CHIEFTAIN: Humans. Humani. Make feast. <br>
GUARD: Go back to where you came from. I said, go back. Back! <br>
JACK: Oh, don't tell him to put his gun down. <br>
DOCTOR: He's not my responsibility. <br>
JACK: And I am? Huh, that makes a change. <br>
CHIEFTAIN: Kind watch you. Kind hungry. <br>
(The tribe back away and leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thanks for that. <br>
GUARD: Right. Let's get you inside. <br>
PADRA: My name is Padra Toc Shafe Cane. Tell me. Just tell me, can you
take me to Utopia? <br>
GUARD: Oh yes, sir. Yes, I can.

inside. One of them is calling himself a doctor. <br>

here? My mother is Kistane Shafe Cane. My brother's name is Beltone. <br>

PADRA: The Shafe Canes, anyone? Kistane from Red Force Five? My name's
Padra. <br>
CREET: Anyone? Kistane and Beltone Shafe Cane? Anyone know the Shafe
Cane family? Anyone called Shafe Cane? <br>
MARTHA: It's like a refugee camp. <br>
JACK: Stinking. Oh, sorry. No offence. Not you. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you see that? The ripe old smell of humans. You survived.
Oh, you might have spent a million years evolving into clouds of gas,
and another million as downloads, but you always revert to the same
basic shape. The fundamental humans. <br>
CREET: Kistane Shafe Cane. <br>
DOCTOR: End of the universe and here you are. Indomitable! That's the
word. Indomitable! Ha! <br>
CREET: Is there a Kistane Shafe Cane? <br>

PADRA: Beltone? <br>
MARTHA: It's not all bad news. <br>
(A young man stands up. Jack shakes his hand.) <br>
JACK: Captain Jack Harkness. And who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Stop it. Give us a hand with this. It's half deadlocked. I need
you to overwrite the code. Let's find out where we are. <br>
(Together, the Doctor and Jack open the door which turns out to be part
way up a giant rocket silo. The Doctor nearly falls in.) <br>
JACK: Gotcha. <br>
DOCTOR: Thanks. <br>
JACK: How did you cope without me? <br>
MARTHA: Now that is what I call a rocket. <br>
DOCTOR: They're not refugees, they're passengers. <br>
MARTHA: He said they were going to Utopia. <br>
DOCTOR: The perfect place. Hundred trillion years, it's the same old
dream. You recognise those engines? <br>
JACK: Nope. Whatever it is, it's not rocket science. But it's hot,
though. <br>
(They shut the door again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Boiling. But if the universe is falling apart, what does Utopia
mean? <br>
(Yana arrives.) <br>
YANA: The Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: That's me. <br>
YANA: Good! Good! Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. <br>
DOCTOR: It's good apparently. <br>

equipment straight away.) <br>
CHANTHO: Chan welcome tho. <br>
YANA: Now, this is the gravitissimal accelerator. It's past its best
but it works. <br>
CHANTHO: Chan welcome tho. <br>
YANA: And over here is the footprint impellor system. Now, do you know
anything about endtime gravity <br>
MARTHA: Hello. Who are you? <br>
CHANTHO: Chan Chantho tho. <br>
YANA: But we can't get it to harmonise. <br>
JACK: Captain Jack Harkness. <br>
DOCTOR: Stop it. <br>
JACK: Can't I say hello to anyone? <br>
CHANTHO: Chan I do not protest tho. <br>
JACK: Maybe later, Blue. So, what have we got here? <br>
DOCTOR: And all this feeds into the rocket? <br>
YANA: Yeah, except without a stable footprint, you see, we're unable to
achieve escape velocity. If only we could harmonise the five impact
patterns and unify them, well, we might yet make it. What do you think,
Doctor? Any ideas? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, er, basically, sort of, not a clue. <br>
YANA: Nothing? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not from around these parts. I've never seen a system like
it. Sorry. <br>
YANA: No, no. I'm sorry. It's my fault. There's been so little help. <br>
(Over in the corner with chairs, a table and a drinks machine, Martha
pulls a transparent container from Jack's backpack. It contains a
hand.) <br>
MARTHA: Oh, my God. You've got a hand? A hand in a jar. A hand in a jar
in your bag. <br>
DOCTOR: But that, that, that's my hand. <br>
JACK: I said I had a Doctor detector. <br>
CHANTHO: Chan is this a tradition amongst your people tho? <br>
MARTHA: Not on my street. What do you mean, that's your hand? You've
got both your hands, I can see them. <br>
DOCTOR: Long story. I lost my hand Christmas Day, in a swordfight. <br>
(Reminder of when the Sycorax leader chopped of the Doctor's hand and
it fell from the spaceship in Christmas Invasion.) <br>
MARTHA: What? And you grew another hand? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, yeah, yeah, I did. Yeah. Hello. <br>
YANA: Might I ask, what species are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Time Lord, last of. Heard of them? Legend or anything? Not even
a myth? Blimey, end of the universe is a bit humbling. <br>
CHANTHO: Chan it is said that I am the last of my species too tho. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, what was your name? <br>
YANA: My assistant and good friend, Chantho. A survivor of the
Malmooth. This was their planet, Malcassairo, before we took refuge. <br>
DOCTOR: The city outside, that was yours? <br>
CHANTHO: Chan the conglomeration died tho. <br>
DOCTOR: Conglomeration. That's what I said. <br>
JACK: You're supposed to say sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Sorry. <br>
CHANTHO: Chan most grateful tho. <br>
MARTHA: You grew another hand? <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, again. It's fine. Look, really, it's me. <br>
MARTHA: All this time and you're still full of surprises. <br>
CHANTHO: Chan you are most unusual tho. <br>
DOCTOR: Well. <br>
JACK: So what about those things outside? The Beastie Boys. What are
they? <br>
YANA: We call them the Futurekind, which is a myth in itself, but it's
feared they are what we will become, unless we reach Utopia. <br>
DOCTOR: And Utopia is? <br>
YANA: Oh, every human knows of Utopia. Where have you been? <br>
DOCTOR: Bit of a hermit. <br>
YANA: A hermit with friends? <br>
DOCTOR: Hermits United. We meet up every ten years and swap stories
about caves. It's good fun, for a hermit. So, er, Utopia? <br>
(Yana shows them a display on the gravitational field navigation
system.) <br>
YANA: The call came from across the stars, over and over again. Come to
Utopia. Originating from that point. <br>
DOCTOR: Where is that? <br>
YANA: Oh, it's far beyond the Condensate Wilderness, out towards the
Wildlands and the Dark Matter reefs, calling us in. The last of the
humans scattered across the night. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you think's out there? <br>
YANA: We can't know. A colony, a city, some sort of haven? The Science
Foundation created the Utopia Project thousands of years ago to
preserve mankind, to find a way of surviving beyond the collapse of
reality itself. Now perhaps they found it. Perhaps not. But it's worth
a look, don't you think? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. <br>
(Yana hears the drumbeats again, all but drowning out the Doctor's
words.) <br>
DOCTOR: And the signal keeps modulating, so it's not automatic. That's
a good sign someone's out there. And that's, oh, that's a navigation
matrix. So you can fly without stars to guide you. Professor?
Professor? Professor. <br>
YANA: I, er, ahem, right, that's enough talk. There's work to do. Now
if you could leave, thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: You all right? <br>
YANA: Yes, I'm fine. And busy. <br>
DOCTOR: Except that rocket's not going to fly, is it? This footprint
mechanism thing, it's not working. <br>
YANA: We'll find a way. <br>
DOCTOR: You're stuck on this planet. And you haven't told them, have
you? That lot out there, they still think they're
going to fly. <br>
YANA: Well, it's better to let them live in hope. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite right, too. And I must say, Professor er, what was it? <br>
YANA: Yana. <br>
DOCTOR: Professor Yana. This new science is well beyond me, but all the
same, a boost reversal circuit, in any time frame, must be a circuit
which reverses the boost. So, I wonder, what would happen if I did
this? <br>
(He sonics the end of a cable and pulls. Power surges through the
machines.) <br>
CHANTHO: Chan it's working tho! <br>
YANA: But how did you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we've been chatting away, I forgot to tell you. I'm
brilliant. </font></p>

by horses, World War One, World War Two, poison, starvation, a stray
