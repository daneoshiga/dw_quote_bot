will predict his actions. <br>
ROSE: I don't know! And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. <br>
DALEK: Predict! Predict! Predict! <br>
DALEK 2: Tardis detected in flight. <br>
DALEK: Launch missiles. Exterminate. <br>
ROSE: You can't! The Tardis hasn't got any defences. You're going to
kill him. <br>
DALEK: You have predicted correctly. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JACK: We've got incoming! <br>
(The Dalek missiles strike the Tardis, and there is a big fireball in
the vacuum of space. Neat trick.) <br>
JACK: The extrapolator's working. We've got a fully functional
forcefield. Try saying that when you're drunk. <br>
DOCTOR: And for my next trick. <br>
(The Tardis materialises around Rose and the nearest Dalek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, get down! Get down, Rose! <br>
DALEK: Exterminate! <br>
(The Dalek fires and misses. Jack takes out the Dalek with the modified
Defabricator.) <br>
ROSE: You did it. <br>
(The Doctor hugs Rose.) <br>
ROSE: Feels like I haven't seem you in years. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you I'd come and get you. <br>
ROSE: Never doubted it. <br>
DOCTOR: I did. You all right? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. You? <br>
DOCTOR: Not bad, been better. <br>
JACK: Hey, don't I get a hug? <br>
ROSE: Oh, come here! <br>
JACK: I was talking to him. <br>
(Jack hugs Rose anyway.) <br>
JACK: Welcome home. <br>
ROSE: Oh, I thought I'd never see you again. <br>
JACK: Oh, you were lucky. That was just a one shot wonder. Drained the
gun of all its power supply. Now it's just a piece of junk.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: You said they were extinct. How comes they're
still alive? <br>
JACK: One minute they're the greatest threat in the Universe, the next
minute they vanished out of time and space. <br>
DOCTOR: They went off to fight a bigger war. The Time War <br>
JACK: I thought that was just a legend. <br>
DOCTOR: I was there. The war between the Daleks and the Time Lords,
with the whole of creation at stake. My people were destroyed, but they
took the Daleks with them. I almost thought it was worth it. Now it
turns out they died for nothing. <br>
ROSE: There's thousands of them now. We could hardly stop one. What're
we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: No good stood round here chin wagging. Human race, you'd gossip
all day. The Daleks have got the answers. Let's go and meet the
neighbours. <br>
ROSE: You can't go out there!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Spaceship]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! <br>
(The Dalek rays are stopped by a forcefield extending a good three
metres out from the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is that it? Useless! Nul points. It's all right, come on out.
That forcefield can hold back anything. <br>
JACK: Almost anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but I wasn't going to tell them that. Thanks. <br>
JACK: Sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know what they call me in the ancient legends of the
Dalek Homeworld? The Oncoming Storm. You might've removed all your
emotions but I reckon right down deep in your DNA, there's one little
spark left, and that's fear. Doesn't it just burn when you face me? So
tell me. How did you survive the Time War? <br>
EMPEROR [OC]: They survived through me. <br>
(The lights come up to reveal a large apparatus, which on closer
inspection is an exploded giant
Dalek casing, and a blue-skinned one-eyed mutant is happy for everyone
to see it
sitting there as if on its throne..) <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, Captain, this is the Emperor of the Daleks. <br>
EMPEROR: You destroyed us, Doctor. The Dalek race died in your inferno,
but my ship survived, falling through time, crippled but alive. <br>
DOCTOR: I get it. <br>
DALEK: Do not interrupt. <br>
DALEK 2: Do not interrupt. <br>
DALEK 3: Do not interrupt. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you're forgetting something. I'm the Doctor, and if
there's one thing I can do, it's talk. I've got five billion languages,
and you haven't got one way of stopping me. So if anybody's going to
shut up, it's you! Okey doke. So, where were we? <br>
EMPEROR: We waited here in the dark space, damaged but rebuilding.
Centuries passed, and we quietly infiltrated the systems of Earth,
harvesting the waste of humanity. The prisoners, the refugees, the
dispossessed. They all came to us. The bodies were filtered, pulped,
sifted. The seed of the human race is perverted. Only one cell in a
billion was fit to be nurtured. <br>
DOCTOR: So you created an army of Daleks out of the dead. <br>
ROSE: That makes them half human. <br>
EMPEROR: Those words are blasphemy. <br>
DALEK: Do not blaspheme. <br>
DALEK 2: Do not blaspheme. <br>
DALEK 3: Do not blaspheme. <br>
EMPEROR: Everything human has been purged. I cultivated pure and
blessed Dalek. <br>
DOCTOR: Since when did the Daleks have a concept of blasphemy? <br>
EMPEROR: I reached into the dirt and made new life. I am the God of all
Daleks! <br>
DALEKS: Worship him. Worship him. Worship him. <br>
DOCTOR: They're insane. Hiding in silence for hundreds of years, that's
enough to drive anyone mad. But it's worse than that. Driven mad by
your own flesh. The stink of humanity. You hate your own existence. And
that makes them more deadly than ever. We're going. <br>
EMPEROR: You may not leave my presence. <br>
DALEK: Stay where you are. <br>
DALEKS: Exterminate! <br>
(The Doctor, Rose and Jack go back inside the Tardis. The Daleks start
shooting at the forcefield again.) <br>
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate!

DOCTOR: Turn everything up. All transmitters full power, wide open.
Now! Do it! <br>
PAVALE: What does this do? <br>
DOCTOR: Stops the Daleks from transmatting on board. How did you get
on? Did you contact Earth? <br>
PAVALE: Well, we tried to warn them, but all they did was suspend our
license because we stopped the programmes. <br>
DOCTOR: And the planet's just sitting there, defenceless. Lynda,
what're you still doing on board? I told you to evacuate everyone. <br>
PAVALE: She wouldn't go. <br>
LYNDA: Didn't want to leave you. <br>
WOMAN: There weren't enough shuttles anyway, or I wouldn't be here.
We've got about a hundred people stranded on Floor Zero. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is pulling bits out of the conduits.) <br>
DOCTOR: Dalek plan. Big mistake, because what have they left me with?
Anyone? Anyone? Oh, come on, it's obvious. A great big transmitter.
This station. If I can change the signal, fold it back, sequence it,
anyone? <br>
JACK: You've got to be kidding. <br>
DOCTOR: Give the man a medal. <br>
JACK: A Delta Wave? <br>
DOCTOR: A Delta Wave! <br>
ROSE: What's a Delta Wave? <br>
JACK: A wave of Van Cassadyne energy. It fries your brain. Stand in the
way of a Delta Wave and your head gets barbequed. <br>
DOCTOR: And this place can transmit a massive wave. Wipe out the
Daleks!&nbsp;<br>
LYNDA: Well, get started and do it then. <br>
DOCTOR: Trouble is, wave this size, building this big, brain as clever
as mine, should take about, oh, three days? How long till the Fleet
arrive? <br>
PAVALE: Twenty two minutes. <br>
(Later, after some rerouting of bits and pieces.) <br>
JACK: We've now got a forcefield so they can't blast us out of the sky,
but that doesn't stop the Daleks from physically invading. <br>
PAVALE: Do they know about the Delta Wave? <br>
JACK: They'll have worked it out at the same time. So, they want to
stop the Doctor. That means they've got to get to this level, five
hundred. Now, I can concentrate the extrapolator around the top six
levels, five hundred to four nine five. So they'll penetrate the
station below that at level four nine four and fight their way up. <br>
PAVALE: Who are they fighting? <br>
JACK: Us. <br>
PAVALE: And what are we fighting with? <br>
JACK: The guards had guns with bastic bullets. That's enough to blow a
Dalek wide open. <br>
WOMAN: There's five of us. <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, you can help me. I need all these wires stripping bare. <br>
WOMAN: Right, now there's four of us. <br>
JACK: Then let's move it. Into the lift. Isolate the lift controls. <br>
(Pavale and his colleague run off.) <br>
LYNDA: I just want to say, er, thanks, I suppose, and I'll do my best. <br>
DOCTOR: Me too. <br>
(They shake hands and Lynda moves away.) <br>
JACK: It's been fun, but I guess this is goodbye. <br>
ROSE: Don't talk like that. The Doctor's going to do it. You just watch
him. <br>
JACK: Rose, you are worth fighting for. (kisses her) Wish I'd never met
you, Doctor. I was much better off as a coward. <br>
(Jack kisses the Doctor.) <br>
JACK: See you in hell. <br>
(Jack leaves.) <br>
ROSE: He's going to be all right, isn't he? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jack stands on a pile of crates and fires a
machine gun into the air to get some attention.) <br>
JACK: One last time! Any more volunteers? There's an army about to
invade this station. I need every last citizen to mount a defence. <br>
RODRICK: Don't listen to him. There aren't any Daleks. They disappeared
thousands of years ago. <br>
(The Floor Manager volunteers.) <br>
JACK: Thanks. As for the rest of you, the Daleks will enter the station
at floor four nine four and as far as I can tell, they'll head up, not
down. But that's not a promise. So here's a few words of advice. Keep
quiet. And if you hear fighting up above, if you hear us dying, then
tell me that the Daleks aren't real. Don't make a sound. Let's go. <br>
(Jack, Lynda and the few volunteers all get in the lift.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: Suppose. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROSE: Nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: You said suppose. <br>
ROSE: No, I was just thinking. I mean, obviously you can't, but, you've
got a time machine. Why can't you just go back to last week and warn
them? <br>
DOCTOR: As soon as the Tardis lands in that second, I become part of
events, stuck in the timeline. <br>
ROSE: Yeah, thought it'd be something like that <br>
DOCTOR: There's another thing the Tardis could do. It could take us
away. We could leave. Let history take its course. We go to Marbella in
1989. <br>
ROSE: Yeah, but you'd never do that. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but you could ask. Never even occurred to you, did it? <br>
ROSE: Well, I'm just too good. <br>
DOCTOR: The Delta Wave's started building. How long does it need? <br>
(They run over to a console.) <br>
ROSE: Is that bad? Okay, it's bad. How bad is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Rose Tyler, you're a genius! We can do it. If I use the Tardis
to cross my old timeline. Yes! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Hold that down and keep position. <br>
ROSE: What's it do? <br>
DOCTOR: Cancels the buffers. If I'm very clever and I'm more than
clever, I'm brilliant, I might just save the world. Or rip it apart <br>
ROSE: I'd go for the first one. <br>
DOCTOR: Me too. Now, I've just got to go and power up the Game Station.
Hold on! <br>
(The Doctor runs out and stops in the midst of his mares-nest of
cables. He looks back at the Tardis then points the sonic screwdriver
at it. The engines start.) <br>
ROSE: Doctor, what're you doing? Can I take my hand off? It's moving. <br>

HOLO-DOCTOR: This is Emergency Programme One. Rose, now listen, this is
important. If this message is activated, then it can only mean one
thing. We must be in danger. And I mean fatal. I'm dead or about to die
any second with no chance of escape. <br>
ROSE: No! <br>
DOCTOR: And that's okay. Hope it's a good death. But I promised to look
after you, and that's what I'm doing. The Tardis is taking you home. <br>
ROSE: I won't let you. <br>
HOLO-DOCTOR: And I bet you're fussing and moaning now. Typical. But
hold on and just listen a bit more. The Tardis can never return for me.
Emergency Programme One means I'm facing an enemy that should never get
their hands on this machine. So this is what you should do. Let the
Tardis die. Just let this old box gather dust. No one can open it. No
one'll even notice it. Let it become a strange little thing standing on
a street corner. And over the years, the world'll move on and the box
will be buried. And if you want to remember me, then you can do one
thing. That's all, one thing. Have a good life. Do that for me, Rose.
Have a fantastic life. <br>
(The hologram flickers out.) <br>
ROSE: You can't do this to me. You can't. Take me back! Take me back!
No! <br>
(Rose tries to use the controls, but the engine stops. She runs outside
into the Powell Estate, then back inside.) <br>
ROSE: Come on, fly. How do you fly? Come on, help me! </font></p>

comes running down the road.) <br>

don't mean all the travelling and seeing aliens and spaceships and
things. That don't matter. The Doctor showed me a better way of living
your life. You know he showed you too. That you don't just give up. You
don't just let things happen. You make a stand. You say no. You have

in the future. It's a link between me and the Doctor. Bad Wolf here,
Bad Wolf there. <br>
MICKEY: But if it's a message, what's it saying? <br>

MICKEY: It's not listening now, is it? <br>
ROSE: We need to get inside it. Last time I saw you, with the Slitheen,
this middle bit opened, and there was this light, and the Doctor said
it was the heart of the Tardis. If we can open it, I can make contact.
I can tell it what to do. <br>
