[OC]: Planet Earth. This is where I was born. And this is where I died.
For the first nineteen years of my life, nothing happened. Nothing at
all. Not ever. And then I met a man called the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR 9: Run. <br>
ROSE [OC]: A man who could change his face. And he took me away from
home in his magical machine. He showed me the whole of time and space.
I thought it would never end. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: How long are you going to stay with me? <br>
ROSE: Forever. <br>
ROSE [OC]: That's what I thought. But then came the army of ghosts.
Then came Torchwood and the War. And that's when it all ended. This is
the story of how I died. </font></p>

children's playground on a bright, sunny day. Rose has a very heavy
rucksack with her.) <br>
ROSE [OC]: Mum, it's us! We're back! <br>
JACKIE: Oh, I don't know why you bother with that phone. You never use
it! <br>
ROSE: Shut up, come here! <br>
JACKIE: Oh, I love you! <br>
ROSE: I love you! <br>
JACKIE: I love you so much! <br>
(Jackie and Rose hug. The Doctor makes his way past.) <br>
JACKIE: Oh no, you don't. Come here! <br>
(Jackie kisses the Doctor.) <br>
JACKIE: Oh, you lovely big fella! Oh, you're all mine. <br>
DOCTOR: Just, just, just put me down! <br>
JACKIE: Yes, you are. <br>
(Rose hands over her rucksack.) <br>
ROSE: I've got loads of washing for you. And I got you this. <br>
(A small ornate metal nick-nack.) <br>
ROSE: It's from the market on this asteroid bazaar. It's made of, er,
what's it called? <br>
DOCTOR: Bazoolium. <br>
ROSE: Bazoolium. When it gets cold, yeah, it means it's going to rain.
When it's hot, it's
going to be sunny. You can use it to tell the weather. <br>
JACKIE: I've got a surprise for you and all. <br>
ROSE: Oh, I get her bazoolium, she doesn't even say thanks. <br>
JACKIE: Guess who's coming to visit? You're just in time. He'll be here
at ten past. Who do you think it is? <br>
ROSE: I don't know. <br>
JACKIE: Oh go on, guess. <br>
ROSE: No, I hate guessing. Just tell me. <br>
JACKIE: It's your granddad. Granddad Prentice. He's on his way any
minute, Right, cup of tea! <br>
(Jackie goes into the kitchen.) <br>
ROSE: She's gone mad. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me something new. <br>
ROSE: Granddad Prentice, that's her dad. But he died, like, ten years
ago. Oh, my God. She's lost it. Mum? What you just said about
granddad. </font></p>

ROSE: But he passed away. His heart gave out. Do you remember that? <br>
JACKIE: Of Course I do. <br>
ROSE: Then how can he come back? <br>
JACKIE: Why don't you ask him yourself? Ten past. Here he comes. <br>
(An ethereal humanoid shape walks through the outside wall and stands
next to Jackie.) <br>

flats.) <br>
DOCTOR: They're everywhere! <br>
(And no one is alarmed at the sight of them.) <br>
ROSE: Doctor, look out! <br>
(One of the shapes walks through the Doctor. It is not a comfortable
sensation.) <br>
JACKIE: They haven't got long. Midday shift only lasts a couple of
minutes. They're about to fade. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, shift? Since when did ghosts have shifts?
Since when did shifts have ghosts? What's going on? <br>
JACKIE: Oh, he's not happy when I know more than him, is he? <br>
DOCTOR: But no one's running or screaming or freaking out. <br>
JACKIE: Why should we? Here we go. Twelve minutes past. <br>
(Somewhere, a man in a lab coat pulls a big lever, like the sort used
to change railway points. The images vanish.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A well-dressed management type woman comes out of
her glass fronted office with
the words Torchwood Institute etched on it.) <br>
YVONNE: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce we've just measured
the ghost energy at five thousand gigawatts. Give yourselves a round of
applause. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Ghostwatch programme is on the television,
presented by that bloke from
Cash in the Attic.) <br>
ALISTAIR APPLETON [on TV]: On today's Ghostwatch, claims that some of
the ghosts are starting to talk, and there seems to be a regular
formation gathering around Westminster Bridge. It's almost like a
military display. <br>
DOCTOR: What the hell's going on? <br>
(The Doctor changes the channel.) <br>
WEATHERMAN [on TV]: And tonight we're expecting very strong ghosts from
London, through the North and up into Scotland. <br>
(Trisha Goddard's show - I married a dead man.) <br>
TRISHA [on TV]: So basically, Eileen, what you're telling me is, that
you are in love with a ghost. <br>
EILEEN [on TV]: He's my ghost, and I love him twenty four seven. <br>
(Change channel to an interview with a ghost hunter.) <br>
DEREK ACORAH [on TV]: Well, no one needs me anymore! <br>
(If only. Change channel to an advert.) <br>
HOUSEWIFE [on TV]: My ghost was pale and grey until I discovered
Ectoshine! <br>
FRENCH NEWSREADER [on TV]: Et le President d'aujourd'hui, quelle est <br>
(An Indian newsreader follows, then a Japanese lady.) <br>
JACKIE: Oh, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all over the world. <br>
(Eastenders.) <br>
PEGGY [on TV]: Listen to me, Den Watts. I don't care if you have come
back from the grave. Get out of my pub! The only spirits I'm serving in
this place are gin, whisky and vodka. So, you heard me. Get out! <br>
(The Doctor turns the TV off.) <br>
DOCTOR: When did it start? <br>
JACKIE: Well, first of all, Peggy heard this noise in the cellar, so
she goes down <br>
DOCTOR: No, I mean worldwide. <br>
JACKIE: Oh. That was about two months ago. Just happened. Woke up one
morning, and there they all were. Ghosts, everywhere. We all ran round
screaming and that. Whole planet was panicking. No sign of you, thank
you very much. Then it sort of sank in. It took us time to realise that
we're lucky. <br>
ROSE: What makes you think it's granddad? <br>
JACKIE: It just feels like him. There's that smell, those old
cigarettes. Can't you smell it? <br>
ROSE: I wish I could, mum, but I can't. <br>
JACKIE: You've got to make an effort. You've got to want it,
sweetheart. <br>
DOCTOR: The more you want it, the stronger it gets. <br>
JACKIE: Sort of, yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Like a psychic link. Of course you want your old dad to be
alive, but you're wishing him into existence. The ghosts are using that
to pull themselves in. <br>
JACKIE: You're spoiling it. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Jackie, but there's no smell, there's no cigarettes.
Just a memory. <br>
ROSE: But if they're not ghosts, what are they then? <br>
JACKIE: Yeah, but they're human! You can see them. They look human. <br>
ROSE: She's got a point. I mean, they're all sort of blurred, but
they're definitely people. <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe not. They're pressing themselves into the surface of the
world. But a footprint doesn't look like a boot. </font></p>

at their computer terminals. Everyone is wearing a bluetooth earpiece.)
<br>
YVONNE: So, what've we got? Any sign of that power loss? <br>
ADEOLA: There's no problems. Must've been a glitch. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RAJESH: But we had nothing. Did they tell you? RND
came up with a new spectrometer yesterday. Barged in here, all full of
themselves. Said they could detect the heat off a single protozoa
through half a mile of steel. <br>
YVONNE [OC]: And what did they find? <br>
RAJESH: Nothing. It gave them nothing. Same as ever. The machines keep
saying the sphere can't exist. But there it is. <br>
(A big blank sphere hanging in midair at the end of the laboratory.
There is a ladder just below it.) <br>
YVONNE [OC]: Anything we can do? <br>
RAJESH: No, I'm all right. It's just, it gets into your head, this
thing. Like it's staring at you. <br>
YVONNE [OC]: All right, we'll catch up later. Thanks, Raj. <br>
RAJESH: Yeah. <br>

can't.)

Rajesh something. He's going mad down there. Not alcohol. <br>

across at a male co-worker. She sends him an internal message.) <br>

ADEOLA [text]: fancy a coffee? <br>
GARETH [text]: though u never ask :) <br>
MAN [OC]: Kept it stable at fifty six point one. <br>
YVONNE [OC]: So, if you just check the statistics. <br>
GARETH: Yvonne? I'm going to double check the stacks, just in case. <br>
YVONNE: Sure. <br>

ADEOLA: Yvonne, I'm going to go and cross reference the levels with the

ADEOLA: This is out of bounds. <br>
GARETH: Yeah, and that's the point. It's completely safe. They're just
building new offices. <br>
ADEOLA: What about the workmen? <br>
GARETH: They must be allocated somewhere else. <br>
ADEOLA: It's not worth it for a snog. <br>
GARETH: It is. Come on.
(Gareth goes through the plastic sheeting. The workmen return for their
ladder and paints, then leave.) <br>
ADEOLA: Gareth? Now, don't be daft, where've you gone? Gareth! Look,
I'm going to
head back. I'm seeing you tonight anyway. Gareth? I'm going to go back
to work. <br>
(She steps through the plastic sheeting.) <br>
ADEOLA: This is it. I'm going. See you. Now stop it, Gareth. I'm not
kidding, just stop it! <br>
(There are more curtains of plastic. One has the shadow of a figure
behind it.) <br>
ADEOLA: Sorry, I'm just looking for my friend. Did anyone come down

DOCTOR: Triangulates their point of origin. <br>
ROSE: I don't suppose it's the Gelth? <br>
DOCTOR: Nah. They were just coming through one little rift. This lot
are transposing themselves over the whole planet. Like tracing paper. <br>
JACKIE: You're always doing this. Reducing it to science. Why can't it
be real? Just think of it, though. All the people we've lost. Our
families coming back home. Don't you think it's beautiful? <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's horrific. Rose, give us a hand. </font></p>

(He hands her the sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Setting fifteen B. Hold it against the port, eight seconds and
stop. <br>

ROSE: No, I didn't mean that. <br>
JACKIE: I know what you meant. What happens when I'm gone? <br>
ROSE: Don't talk like that. <br>
JACKIE: No, but really. When I'm dead and buried, you won't have any
reason to come back home. What happens then? <br>
ROSE: I don't know. <br>
JACKIE: Do you think you'll ever settle down? <br>
ROSE: The Doctor never will, so I can't. I'll just keep on travelling. <br>
JACKIE: And you'll keep on changing. And in forty years time, fifty,
there'll be this woman, this strange woman, walking through the
marketplace on some planet a billion miles from Earth. But she's not

trapped. Jackie and Rose watch it on the scanner. The Doctor puts on a
pair of red and blue 3D cardboard spectacles and makes an adjustment to
his control box. An alarm sounds in the Institute.) <br>

room. The ghost fades and vanishes. The Doctor gathers up the cones.) <br>
MATT: It was a very specific excitation of the ghost field, and that
makes it easy to pinpoint. Almost there South London. South East
fifteen. It's a council estate. The Powell Estate. SU15 7GO. It was a

Not from us. So where is she? <br>

DOCTOR: What, did it crash? <br>
YVONNE: No, we shot it down. It violated our airspace. Then we stripped
it bare. The weapon that destroyed the Sycorax on Christmas Day? That
was us. Now, if you'd like to come with me. The Torchwood Institute has
a motto. If it's alien, it's ours. Anything that comes from the sky, we
strip it down and we use it for the good of the British Empire. <br>

Sebastian, isn't it? <br>
SEBASTIAN: Yes, Ma'am. <br>
YVONNE: Thank you, Sebastian. I think it's very important to know
everyone by name. Torchwood is a very modern organisation. People
skills. That's what it's all about these days. I'm a people person. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you got anyone called Alonso? <br>
YVONNE: No, I don't think so. Is that important? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I suppose not. What was your name? <br>
YVONNE: Yvonne. Yvonne Hartman. <br>
(The Doctor picks up a black plastic step-stool with a handle on top.) <br>
YVONNE: Ah, yes. Now, we're rather fond of these. The Magnaclamp. Found
in a spaceship buried at the base of Mount Snowdon. Attach this to an
object and it cancels the mass. I could use it to lift two tonnes of
weight with a single hand. That's an imperial ton, by the way.
Torchwood refuses to go metric. <br>
JACKIE: I could do with that to carry the shopping. <br>
YVONNE: All these devices are for Torchwood's benefit, not the general
public's. <br>
DOCTOR: So, what about these ghosts? <br>
YVONNE: Ah yes, the ghosts. They're er what you might call a side
effect. <br>
DOCTOR: Of what? <br>
YVONNE: All in good time, Doctor. There is an itinerary, trust me. <br>
(The TARDIS is driven past on the back of a truck.) <br>
JACKIE: Oi! Where are you taking that? <br>
YVONNE: If it's alien, it's ours. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll never get inside it. <br>
YVONNE: Hmm! Et cetera. <br>

never heard of you. <br>
YVONNE: But of course not. You're the enemy. You're actually named in
the Torchwood Foundation Charter of 1879 as an enemy of the Crown. <br>
DOCTOR: 1879. That was called Torchwood, that house in Scotland. <br>
YVONNE: That's right. Where you encountered Queen Victoria and the
werewolf. <br>
JACKIE: I think he makes half of it up. <br>
YVONNE: Her Majesty created the Torchwood Institute with the express
intention of keeping Britain great, and fighting the alien horde. <br>

DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
JACKIE: What is that thing? <br>
YVONNE: We got no idea. <br>
JACKIE: But what's wrong with it? <br>
RAJESH: What makes you think there's something wrong with it? <br>
JACKIE: I don't know. It just feels weird. <br>
YVONNE: Well, the sphere has that effect on everyone. Makes you want to
run and hide, like it's forbidden. <br>
RAJESH: We tried analysing it using every device imaginable. <br>
(The Doctor puts on his 3D glasses.) <br>
RAJESH: But according to our instruments, the sphere doesn't exist. It
weighs nothing, it doesn't age. No heat, no radiation, and has no
atomic mass. <br>
JACKIE: But I can see it. <br>
RAJESH: Fascinating, isn't it? It upsets people because it gives off
nothing. It is absent. <br>
YVONNE: Well, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: This is a Void Ship. <br>
YVONNE: And what is that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's impossible for starters. I always thought it was
just a theory, but it's a vessel designed to exist outside time and
space, travelling through the Void. <br>
RAJESH: And what's the Void? <br>
DOCTOR: The space between dimensions. There's all sorts of realities
around us, different dimensions, billions of parallel universes all
stacked up against each other. The Void is the space in between,
containing absolutely nothing. Imagine that. Nothing. No light, no
dark, no up, no down, no life, no time. Without end. My people called
it the Void. The Eternals call it the Howling. But some people call it
Hell. <br>
RAJESH: But someone built the sphere. What for? Why go there? <br>
DOCTOR: To explore? To escape? You could sit inside that thing and
eternity would pass you by. The Big Bang, end of the Universe, start of
the next, wouldn't even touch the sides. You'd exist outside the whole
of creation. <br>
YVONNE: You see, we were right. There is something inside it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. <br>
RAJESH: So how do we get in there? <br>
DOCTOR: We don't! We send that thing back into Hell. How did it get
here in the first place? <br>
YVONNE: Well, that's how it all started. The sphere came through into
this world, and the ghosts followed in its wake. <br>
DOCTOR: Show me. <br>
(The Doctor walks out and turns left.) <br>
YVONNE: No, Doctor. <br>

Yvonne points the Doctor at the blank wall at the far end of the Lever
room.) <br>
YVONNE: The sphere came through here. A hole in the world. Not active
at the moment,
but when we fire particle engines at that exact spot, the breech opens
up. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you even find it? <br>
YVONNE: We were getting warning signs for years. A radar black spot. So
we built this place, Torchwood Tower. The breech was six hundred foot
above sea level. It was on the only way to reach it. <br>
DOCTOR: You built a skyscraper just to reach a spatial disturbance? How
much money have you got? <br>
YVONNE: Enough. <br>
(Jackie is looking out of a window.) <br>
JACKIE: Hold on a minute. We're in Canary Wharf. Must be. This
building, it's Canary Wharf. <br>
YVONNE: Well, that is the public name for it. But to those in the know,
it's Torchwood. <br>
DOCTOR: So, you find the breach, probe it, the sphere comes through six
hundred feet above London, bam. It leaves a hole in the fabric of
reality. And that hole, you think, oh, shall we leave it alone? Shall
we back off? Shall we play it safe? Nah, you think let's make it
bigger! <br>
YVONNE: It's a massive source of energy. If we can harness that power,
we need never depend on the Middle East again. Britain will become
truly independent. Look, you can see for yourself. Next Ghost Shift's
in two minutes.

it over us. Assuming alien authority over the Rights of Man. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me show you. Sphere comes through. <br>
(He points his sonic screwdriver at her glass wall. It cracks.) <br>
DOCTOR: But when it made the hole, it cracked the world around it. The
entire surface of this dimension splintered. And that's how the ghosts
get through. That's how they get everywhere. They're bleeding through
the fault lines. Walking from their world, across the Void, and into
yours, with the human race hoping and wishing and helping them along.
But too many ghosts, and <br>

YVONNE: Well, in that case we'll have to be more careful. Positions!
Ghost Shift in one minute. <br>

YVONNE: We have done this a thousand times. <br>
DOCTOR: Then stop at a thousand! <br>

but equally they can close it. <br>

YVONNE: Sorry? <br>

fireworks. <br>
ADEOLA: Ghost Shift in ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two <br>

possible. But the programme will recommence, as soon as you've
explained everything. <br>
