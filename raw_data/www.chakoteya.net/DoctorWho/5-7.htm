<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAMIE: We can't just leave her. <br>
DOCTOR: We're not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay.
She'll be perfectly all right with the Harrises. Now don't worry so
much. <br>
JAMIE: I'm not, I'm just. Och, come on, let's go. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, where would you like to go? <br>
JAMIE: I couldn't care less. <br>
DOCTOR: I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie.<br>
(The Tardis dematerialises and Victoria's image fades from the screen.
Later in the flight, Jamie is dozing in a chair.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, we're landing. Jamie! <br>
JAMIE: Huh? <br>
DOCTOR: We're landing! <br>
JAMIE: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's have a look at the scanner, shall we? <br>
(The scanner screen is blank.) <br>
JAMIE: I thought you said we'd landed? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, we are, but I seem to have lost the picture. Let's try
a little bit more power, shall we? <br>
JAMIE: Are you sure you're pushing the right one? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I am. Look at the fault indicator, will you?
It's round there on the left. <br>
JAMIE: No, it's all right here. <br>
DOCTOR: No movement at all? <br>
JAMIE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's funny. The air's all right, the temperature's
perfectly normal. There seems to be rather a lot of metal all around us
<br>
JAMIE: What? Oh, you know I can't hear you when you talk to yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: There we are, it's coming up now. <br>
(A beautiful lake appears on the scanner.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, now that looks all right! Boy! Look at it. Hey, what's
that? <br>
(It's an exotic animal.) <br>
JAMIE: The size of it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's funny, it's changed to night now. <br>
JAMIE: It's a wee bit quick, isn't it? Look, it's changed again. What's
going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear. Those pictures aren't what's happening outside, I'm
certain of that. <br>
JAMIE: Why do they keep appearing then? <br>
DOCTOR: They're temptations. <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis is trying to warn us to get away from here to
somewhere more pleasant. I must have pushed the wrong switch. <br>
JAMIE: The red light's stopped flashing. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
JAMIE: Something must be wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Well the power's overloading. The power lines are
overloading!
(There's a flash.) <br>
DOCTOR: The fluid link's gone! <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, look under here. <br>
(A toxic gas is coming from the base of the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: The mercury's vapourising! We've got to get out of here, come
on. <br>
JAMIE: But how? <br>
(The Doctor opens a small hatch beside the main doors to reveal a
golden rod with capped ends attached to a bracket.)&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Hold on to me. <br>
JAMIE: What are you going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Just hold on! <br>
(The Doctor grasps the rod and pulls it from its holder. The console
room walls shimmer and fold in on themselves. The doors are now open
and the Doctor and Jamie get out.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rocket motor section]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A cramped compartment.) <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, what's happened to the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: I disengaged the time vector generator. <br>
JAMIE: The what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well once removed, it alters the size of the Tardis. The inside
becomes an ordinary telephone box again. Come along, come and sit over
here. <br>
(The Doctor still has the rod, and Jamie is coughing a lot.) <br>
DOCTOR: If I hadn't have done, the mercury vapour would have killed us.
<br>
JAMIE: Where are we?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: It looks like the motor section of some sort of rocket. <br>
JAMIE: A rocket? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. There's an artificial gravity system, too. <br>
JAMIE: What does that do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's what keeps us on our feet, otherwise we'd be
floating around. <br>
JAMIE: Oh. There's no water around, is there? <br>
DOCTOR: Water, no. Not in here, Jamie. There's no movement either, is
there. <br>
JAMIE: We're on the ground, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I expect so. Ouch! <br>
JAMIE: What's the matter? Well, don't keep me in suspense, what's
happened? <br>
(The Doctor pulls out a paper bag out of his pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Have a lemon sherbet. It'll quench your thirst. <br>
(The Doctor goes to examine the door of the compartment.) <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, the warning mechanism obviously thought there was
something wrong out here, but what? I mean, everything's so, well,
dead, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Look. It's a track. <br>
(There are marks on the floor leading under the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why, that's oil. It must be some sort of machine. It's recent,
too. <br>
JAMIE: Well, I wonder what that would
(Jamie presses a button and the door opens.) <br>
JAMIE: I just. Oh.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It is an empty corridor. They follow the track
past two other doorways before reaching a blank metal shutter at the
far end. There are controls and a monitor screen in the wall nearby.) <br>
JAMIE: Shall we open the door? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, there may be something on the other side. Here. <br>
(The Doctor looks at the monitor controls and flicks a switch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here we are. <br>
(The image of a shadow-filled control room appears on the screen. It is
filled with banks of computers and control panels, but there are no
people visible. There is a small coffin-shaped pod next to an airlock,
with a large metal crate on the other side.) <br>
JAMIE: Looks safe enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. What caused the defence mechanism of the Tardis to
register danger then? And where's the crew? And what's this track?
There's plenty of air in there. Let's try and get in. <br>
(The door won't open.) <br>
JAMIE: Oh. I'll look up here then. <br>
(Jamie goes back to the first of the two doors and opens it. There's
nothing interesting inside so he closes it and goes to the other one.) <br>
JAMIE: Stores in that one. <br>
DOCTOR: It's living quarters here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rocket living quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The door closes behind them. There is a bunk bed
and a dispensing machine, table and two chairs.) <br>
JAMIE: Ah. Water! <br>
(Meanwhile, in the control room, a squat, squared-off robot comes out
of the shadow. It has two short stubby arms and protruding antennae,
and illuminated detectors instead of a face. It communicates
electronically with the rocket's systems. The door opens and the robot
looks out. It sees nothing and the door closes again.) <br>
JAMIE: I'd have thought a rocket this size would have carried more than
two people. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, it does. It carries four. Two on duty and two
resting. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, the Tardis must have gone mad, then. I mean, there's nothing
on board here, so there's no danger. <br>
DOCTOR: Isn't there? <br>
(The Doctor looks through a porthole.) <br>
DOCTOR: We're just drifting, Jamie. Drifting aimlessly in space.
Perhaps that's what the Tardis was trying to warn us about. <br>
JAMIE: What's it matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Matter? We're just a piece of space flotsam, don't you realise
that? <br>
JAMIE: Well all right, stick your rod dimen <br>
DOCTOR: Time vector generator. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, stick it back in, and we'll float off somewhere else. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's not as simple as that, Jamie. The fluid, hmm? We need
mercury to refill it, don't we. <br>
JAMIE: Well there must be some on board here, surely? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I hope so. <br>
JAMIE: Well there's got to be. <br>
DOCTOR: What's happened to the crew? They haven't just gone out for a
little constitutional, you know. <br>
JAMIE: Well, we won't find that out till we look inside that control
room, will we? <br>
(In the control room, a three-handed clock is running. The numeric
display above reads 10,025 and falling.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rocket motor section]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor and Jamie have searched the ship.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've searched my side. There's not a drop of mercury
anywhere. <br>
JAMIE: Me, too. No, the only place we haven't searched is that control
room. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we'll have a breather, and then we'll try in there. <br>
JAMIE: And perhaps we'll find some food in that machine as well. <br>
DOCTOR: I can give you another lemon drop. <br>
JAMIE: Something a bit more substantial, please. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you fancy? <br>
JAMIE: Well right now I'd like a nice plate of roast beef with all the
trimmings. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll see what I can do. <br>
JAMIE: Eh? Ah now Doctor, where are you going to find a plate of roast
beef on this place? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rocket living quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor works the dispensing machine controls.)
<br>
JAMIE: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Roast beef, you said? <br>
JAMIE: Well, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: What vegetables? <br>
JAMIE: Potatoes <br>
DOCTOR: Potatoes. <br>
JAMIE: And cabbage. <br>
DOCTOR: And cabbage. What about a drop of fruit salad? <br>
JAMIE: Fruit salad, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And I'll have some pork, potatoes and carrots. And, I'll have a
drop of ice-cream. <br>
(Two paper plates appear, with white cubes on them.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we are. what about the gravy? <br>
JAMIE: I don't think so. <br>
DOCTOR: Gravy. <br>
JAMIE: Am I supposed to eat this? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It'll be delicious. <br>
JAMIE: I've heard of a square meal, but this is ridiculous. <br>
DOCTOR: Sit down and eat up. <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, what do you think Victoria's doing now? <br>
DOCTOR: Now? Time is relative, Jamie. If I knew when 'now' was, I might
be able to hazard a guess. <br>
JAMIE: You know what I mean. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, she's decided to stay in a good historical period. Very
few wars, great prosperity. She'll be happy enough. This is very
filling, isn't it? <br>
JAMIE: Aye. Well, what do we do now?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Well, when we've digested our dinner we'll have another try to
get into the control room. <br>
JAMIE: Oh well, while you do that, I'm going to have a wee lie down. <br>
(Jamie stretches out on the bunk.) <br>
JAMIE: Tell me, though. What do you think happened to the crew? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. I wish I did. I suppose they've been
overtaken by some disaster or other. Perhaps we'll find out when we get
into the control room.
(The control room door opens and the little robot comes out and goes to
the open door of the motor section. It is quite slow, and is constantly
taking readings of its surroundings. The Doctor is using his pocket
telescope to look out of the porthole.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, at least we don't seem to be in any immediate danger,
Jamie. But I would like to know <br>
(Jamie is fast asleep.) <br>
(The servo-robot has reached the Tardis. In the control room, the
countdown reads 1,000. A light flashes on the robot's casing. It goes
into the corridor and laser-welds the motor section door shut, then
returns to the control room. After listening at the cabin door, the
Doctor opens it and looks into the corridor. He sees a fresh set of
oily tracks on the floor and follows them to the control room door.
There he turns on the wall monitor, but it is full of static. Inside,
the robot connects itself to a computer bank and the rocket begins to
turn. The Doctor is thrown against a wall by the movement. Jamie is
tipped from the bunk, and goes to find the Doctor.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAMIE: Doctor, what's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: I hit my head. Oh! <br>
JAMIE: We're moving. The rocket's moving. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. There's someone in the control room. <br>
JAMIE: Let's have a look. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, Jamie. We've got to get back to the Tardis. It's the
only safe place. <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, the mercury stuff. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind that. <br>
(Jamie helps the groggy Doctor stand up and go to the motor section
door.) <br>
JAMIE: It won't open. Doctor, someone's sealed the door. <br>
(The Doctor collapses. Jamie helps him up and into the cabin.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rocket living quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Lock it, Jamie. Lock it. <br>
JAMIE: Easy. Doctor, are you all right? Doctor? <br>
(The Doctor has collapses onto the bunk.) <br>
(In the control room, the robot disconnects from the computer and goes
to the pod by the airlock. They exchange electronic signals then the
pod opens to reveal a row of small white spheres. The inner and outer
airlock doors open and the room depressurises. The countdown has
reached Zero. The spheres float out through the airlock into space. The
airlock closes and the robot repressurises the control room, then goes
to a large monitor screen which now shows a large space station. Its
top section is flattened, like a large wheel, with a complicated
lattice of rocket motors and antennae below. The robot reconnects to
the computer and the rocket stops.)
JAMIE: Doctor, there's a great big silver thing out here. <br>
DOCTOR: Into the Tardis. I've got to get him to safety. <br>
(Jamie is looking out of the porthole as the Doctor crawls into the
corridor, takes a cap off one end of the time vector generator and
points it at the sealed motor section door. A beam vapourises the seal.
When he has finished, the Doctor puts the cap back on the TVG and puts
the device in his pocket. Before he can open the door, he is aware of
the robot right behind him.) <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, you must see this. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jamie looks out of the cabin to see the robot. He
grabs the metallic blanket from the bunk and throws it over the
machine, which skitters away, blind.) <br>
JAMIE: Back to the cabin, quick!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rocket living quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAMIE: Easy. Easy now. <br>
(Outside, the robot blows the blanket off with a jet of air and heads
for the cabin.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, take this. It's a gun. Like a torch. You have to be
careful. <br>
(He gives Jamie the TVG as the robot's laser begins to burn through the
cabin door. Carefully, Jamie unscrews the tip of the rod and aims it at
the door. The beam hits the robot, sending it flying down to the door
of the motor section where it explodes.) <br>
JAMIE: Oh. We're all right for the time being. But listen, you. Mo more
gallivanting about till I say so, all right? Doctor? Doctor?&nbsp;<br>
(The Doctor is unconscious.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Everyone is gathered around a man at a radio
control console. He is Leo Ryan, Communications Officer.) <br>
RYAN: (Australian) Hold. Get a fix on that. <br>
CORWYN: It's not moving now. <br>
(Gemma Corwyn, Medical Officer.) <br>
LERNOV: Crossover zero. <br>
(Tanya Lernov, Russian.) <br>
RYAN: Triangulate it, Rico. How's it now. Tanya? <br>
CORWYN: The same. <br>
LERNOV: Just a slight drift. <br>
RYAN: No, no the movement isn't real, it's just an illusion caused by
slight polar precession. <br>
(An older man, Commander Jarvis Bennett, enters.) <br>
BENNETT: How's our mystery rocket? <br>
CORWYN: Suddenly lifeless. <br>
RYAN: Doesn't make sense, sir. It must have been driven by something. <br>
CORWYN: No radio contact. <br>
BENNETT: I'm not surprised. I've just checked out its description on
the register. It's a Phoenix Mark Four named Silver Carrier. <br>
RYAN: Tanya? <br>
LERNOV: The register's even. No crossover reading now. <br>
RYAN: No, it's definitely stopped moving. <br>
CORWYN: Silver Carrier? <br>
BENNETT: Supply ship for Station Five. Reported overdue nine weeks ago.
It's only about eighty or ninety million miles off course. <br>
RYAN: Try radio contact again, Rico. <br>
CASALI: Okay. <br>
(Enrico Casali.) <br>
CASALI: Station Three to Silver Carrier. Station Three to Silver
Carrier. Call sign LX88J. Repeat, LX88J. Come in, please. Nothing. <br>
CORWYN: It couldn't have drifted all that way, Jarvis. <br>
BENNETT: No, it couldn't. <br>
LERNOV: Try the emergency again, Leo? <br>
RYAN: Station Three to Silver Carrier. Pull switch with red band to
operate emergency transmitter. <br>
CORWYN: You think their radio's gone? <br>
LERNOV: In case. <br>
BENNETT: Good procedure. I'm afraid we're wasting our time, but waste
it we must. <br>
RYAN: Any reaction, Tanya? <br>
LERNOV: No, nothing. No movement at all. <br>
CORWYN: How does Silver Carrier turn up in this part of the cosmos? <br>
BENNETT: Something happens to the crew. One of them puts on the
automatic. The rocket's travelled so far now, the power feedback to
automatic is probably failing. <br>
RYAN: Yes, that's possible. <br>
BENNETT: It could start up and start moving again at any minute. <br>
CORWYN: And the crew? <br>
BENNETT: A dozen and one things. <br>
RYAN: Well, we've tried everything, sir. We can't raise a sound. <br>
BENNETT: Trouble is, if I'm right about that automatic, and I think I
am, that rocket could suddenly accelerate and whip straight towards us.
There can't be any life on board there, can there?) <br>
(Meanwhile the spheres drift further from the rocket and straight for
the Wheel.) <br>
LERNOV: I'm getting something. Like small meteorites hitting our outer
rim. <br>
(The spheres are landing on the Wheel and being absorbed into the
hull.) <br>
LERNOV: There's another drop in air pressure. <br>
CORWYN: It can't be meteorites, we'd have had some warning. <br>
LERNOV: Well, something. Look. Jumping all over the place. <br>
BENNETT: It's obvious. We must take it some minor objects have escaped
from the Silver Carrier. Objects of small mass and high density. <br>
CORWYN: Then these objects would be clinging close to the rocket,
Jarvis, not descending on us. <br>
BENNETT: It doesn't matter, Gemma, it really doesn't. Don't start
looking for mysteries. Now I can't risk that rocket homing on this
station. <br>
CORWYN: What are you going to do? <br>
BENNETT: In a few moments, you're going to experience a sight rarely
seen by human beings. Leo, is that projector on standby? <br>
RYAN: Yes, sir. Moving into position now. <br>
CORWYN: Jarvis, what are you going to do? <br>
BENNETT: Turn the X-ray laser on the Silver Carrier. In a few moments
you're going to witness the complete destruction of a rocket in space. <br>

LERNOV: If you are referring to Doctor Corwyn, she is known. She is no
stick in the mud. She's perfectly right to be cautious. <br>
RYAN: Come on, Tanya. It's off course about eighty million miles. I
mean, there can't possibly be anyone alive on the thing. <br>
(On the Silver Carrier, Jamie is trying to shine a signal light out of
the cabin porthole. He pulls the light to far and the cable comes out,
putting the room into darkness. He sees a small glow by the Doctor. It
is the Time Vector Generator. Jamie holds it up to the porthole.)

kids again. Bang, bang, blow up the balloon. You're wrong, you know. <br>
CORWYN: Am I? <br>
BENNETT: Say what you like, the Silver Carrier is a menace to the
Wheel. Now surely you can see that? <br>
CORWYN: If you equate menace with automatic power drive, I don't. <br>
BENNETT: What else? <br>
CORWYN: You want me to believe some emergency happened on the Silver
Carrier. The pilot switched to automatic and then tragedy. <br>
BENNETT: Right. <br>
CORWYN: And all the crew died? <br>
BENNETT: Right again. <br>
CORWYN: Where was the Carrier bound for, Jarvis? <br>
BENNETT: Servicing Station Five. I told you. <br>
CORWYN: Then isn't it be reasonable to assume that the automatic would
have taken it to Station Five? <br>
BENNETT: Yes, that's good reasoning. But you're forgetting the
emergency. That could have damaged the control sensors. In fact, it
must have done, which is why the rocket is so far off course. <br>
CORWYN: Assumption again, guesswork. It would be so easy to check. <br>
BENNETT: We can't risk that rocket turning in on us. Don't you see?

original course. It was a service and supply station for number five
station, overdue and presumed lost nine weeks ago. Well, the rocket
couldn't drift eighty seven million miles off course. <br>
DOCTOR: So what's your theory? <br>
ZOE: Well, there's a record of the last contract with the Silver
Carrier rocket. It had seven million miles to touchdown and enough fuel
for twenty million. Well, it couldn't have drifted here off course in
the time involved. It must have been driven and piloted. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, a right wee space detective. <br>
ZOE: There's only one solution. That rocket was re-fuelled in space.
Provided with at least with another twelve fuel rods. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's an interesting theory. <br>
ZOE: Oh, it isn't a theory. You can't disprove the facts. It's pure
logic. <br>
DOCTOR: Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with
authority. Supposing there was a faulty automatic pilot. <br>
ZOE: To drive a rocket eighty seven million miles on fuel for twenty
million? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a possibility. <br>

trying to do. I don't know why, it must be space sickness. They're
spreading fear, alarm, terror. You think I can't see it? <br>

it get through the airlock. Perhaps it'll float through the loading bay
in full view of everybody. <br>

there is some truth in all this. <br>
BENNETT: Don't try and tell me my job, Gemma. I am still Controller of
this Wheel and things will be run in my way. Any orders to the contrary
can come from Earth Central. That's what. <br>

will you Zoe? <br>
ZOE: Isn't he confined to his quarters? <br>
CORWYN: Have him bought here, under guard if necessary, but get him.
I'll be responsible. <br>

CORWYN: Jarvis was right about one thing, Doctor. These Cybermen of
yours can't just walk into the Wheel, you know. <br>

defenceless. <br>

its mineral wealth, and somehow they see a way of doing it through this
Wheel. <br>

you doing? Come back. <br>
BENNETT [on monitor]: No, I'm going on. They've killed Gemma, you know.

LERNOV: Please come back. <br>
BENNETT [on monitor: I lifted the force field. You'd better replace it.

RYAN: Jarvis, watch out! <br>

easily overpowered. The control room watches in horror as the Cyberman
lifts Bennett up over its head and throws him down the corridor. Then
it
zaps him with the chest unit ray.) <br>

large spaceship holds your invasion fleet, and the smaller ships can
only enter the Earth's atmosphere by homing on a radio beam. <br>
