<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor has golden energy streaming from his
hands and head, and he, Jack and Rose believe he is regenerating. With
an effort, the Doctor turns and points both hands towards his spare
hand in the jar by the time console. It absorbs it and he is released.)

DOCTOR: There now. <br>
(He blows on the jar and the glowing stops.) <br>
DOCTOR: You see? Used the regeneration energy to heal myself, but soon
as I was done, I didn't need to change. I didn't want to. Why would I?
Look at me. So, to stop the energy going all the way, I siphoned off
the rest into a handy bio-matching receptacle, namely my hand. My hand
there. My handy spare hand. Remember? Christmas Day, Sycorax. Lost my
hand in a sword fight? That's my hand. What do you think? <br>
ROSE: You're still you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm still me. <br>
(The Doctor and Rose hug. Donna turns to Jack.) <br>
DONNA: You can hug me, if you want. No, really. You can hug me.

IANTO: It's a Time Lock. The ultimate defence programme. Tosh was
working on it. Never thought she finished it, but she did. The Hub's
sealed in a time bubble. Nothing can get in. <br>
GWEN: But that means we can't get out. <br>
IANTO: Nope. Not without unlocking that Dalek. We're trapped inside.
It's all up to Jack now.

the planets.) <br>
SARAH: Those teleport things. Can we use them? If they've taken the
Doctor to the Dalek spaceship, then that's where we need to be. <br>
MICKEY: It's not just a teleport, it's a dimension jump. Man, this
thing rips a hole in the fabric of space. <br>
SARAH: But can we use it? <br>
MICKEY: Not yet. It burns up energy. Needs half an hour between jumps. <br>
SARAH: Then put down your guns. <br>
MICKEY: Do what? <br>
SARAH: If you're carrying a gun, they'll shoot you dead. <br>
(Sarah steps out into the street.) <br>
SARAH: Daleks, I surrender. <br>
DALEK: All humans in this sector will be taken to the Crucible. <br>
MICKEY: She's bloody mad! <br>
JACKIE: Yeah, but Mickey, if they've got the Doctor, then they've got
Rose. <br>

works. I think. But you just stay indoors. There's no Daleks on this
street. You should be all right. Just er, keep quiet. <br>
FRANCINE: But where are you going? <br>
MARTHA: I'm a member of UNIT, and they gave me the Osterhagen Key. I've
got to do my job. I'm sorry. <br>
FRANCINE: Martha. What's an Osterhagen Key? Tell me. What does it do? <br>

the planets. They're calling it the Crucible. Guess that's our
destination. <br>
DONNA: You said these planets were like an engine. But what for? <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, you've been in a parallel world. That world's running
ahead of this universe. You've seen the future. What was it? <br>
ROSE: It's the darkness. <br>
DONNA: The stars were going out. <br>
ROSE: One by one. We looked up at the sky and they were just dying.
Basically, we've been building this, er, this travel machine, this,
this er, dimension cannon, so I could. Well, so I could <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROSE: So I could come back. Shut up. Anyway, suddenly, it started to
work and the dimensions started to collapse. Not just in our world, not
just in yours, but the whole of reality. Even the Void was dead.
Something is destroying everything. <br>
DONNA: In that parallel world, you said something about me. <br>
ROSE: The dimension cannon could measure timelines, and it's, it's
weird, Donna, but they all seemed to converge on you. <br>
DONNA: But why me? I mean, what have I ever done? I'm a temp from
Chiswick. <br>

ROSE: You told me nothing could get through those doors. <br>
JACK: You've got extrapolator shielding. <br>
DOCTOR: Last time we fought the Daleks, they were scavengers and
hybrids, and mad. But this is a fully-fledged Dalek Empire, at the
height of its power. Experts at fighting Tardises, they can do
anything. Right now, that wooden door is just wood. <br>
(Donna can hear a heartbeat thumping in her ears.) <br>
JACK: What about your dimension jump? <br>
ROSE: It needs another twenty minutes. And anyway, I'm not leaving. <br>

JACK: Went down with the power loss. <br>

explode.) <br>

DOCTOR: Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything! Put me in her place.
You can do anything to me, I don't care, just get her out of there! <br>

Donna puts her hand on the spare hand jar. Golden energy flows out and
around her until the jar breaks.) <br>

DONNA: Oh, I keep telling you, I'm not. <br>
NEW DOCTOR: No, but you are. Oh. You really don't believe that, do you?
I can see, Donna, what you're thinking. All that attitude, all that
lip, because all this time you think you're not worth it. <br>
DONNA: Stop it. <br>
NEW DOCTOR: Shouting at the world because no one's listening. Well, why
should they? <br>
DONNA: Doctor? Stop it. <br>
NEW DOCTOR: But look at what you did. No, it's more than that. It's
like we were always heading for this. You came to the Tardis. And you
found me again. Your granddad. Your car. Donna, your car. You parked
your car right where the Tardis was going land. That's not coincidence
at all! We've been blind. Something's been drawing us together for such
a long time. <br>
DONNA: But you're talking like destiny. There's no such thing. Is
there? <br>

SARAH: So there's three of you? <br>
ROSE: Three Doctors? <br>
JACK: I can't tell you what I'm thinking right now. <br>
DOCTOR: You're so unique the timelines were converging on you. Human
being with a Time Lord brain. <br>
DAVROS: But you promised me, Dalek Caan. Why did you not foresee this? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I think he did. Something's been manipulating the timelines
for ages, getting Donna Noble to the right place at the right time. <br>
CAAN: This would always have happened. I only helped, Doctor. <br>
DAVROS: You betrayed the Daleks. <br>
CAAN: I saw the Daleks. What we have done, throughout time and space, I
saw the truth of us, Creator, and I decreed, no more! </font></p>

(Jack fires an extended pulse from his big gun and the Red Dalek
explodes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we've lost the magnetron. And there's only one planet left.
Oh, guess which one. But we can use the Tardis. <br>
(The Doctor runs into the Tardis.) <br>
NEW DOCTOR: Holding Earth stability. Maintaining atmospheric shell. <br>
CAAN: The prophecy must complete. <br>
DAVROS: Don't listen to him. <br>
CAAN: I have seen the end of everything Dalek, and you must make it
happen, Doctor. <br>
NEW DOCTOR: He's right. Because with or without a Reality bomb, this
Dalek Empire's big enough to slaughter the cosmos. They've got to be
stopped. <br>
DONNA: Just, just wait for the Doctor. <br>

have to do it single handed. Martha, keep that level. But not any more.
Jack, there you go. Steady that. Now we can fly this thing. No, Jackie.
No, no. Not you. Don't touch anything. Just stand back. Like it's meant
to be flown. We've got the Torchwood Rift looped around the Tardis by
Mister Smith, and we're

cost. And the cost is him. He destroyed the Daleks. He committed
genocide. He's too dangerous to be left on his own. <br>

DOCTOR: Exactly. You were born in battle, full of blood and anger and
revenge. Remind you of someone? That's me, when we first met. And you
made me better. Now you can do the same for him. <br>

thoughts, same everything. Except I've only got one heart. <br>
ROSE: Which means? <br>
NEW DOCTOR: I'm part human. Specifically, the aging part. I'll grow old
and never regenerate. I've only got one life, Rose Tyler. I could spend
it with you, if you want. <br>
