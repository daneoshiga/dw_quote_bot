<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A group of cowled figures cross the windy moor
with their cart and enter the courtyard of a large house. They are
greeted by the main manservant of the household. From the accents, we
are in Scotland, the clothes say 19th century.) <br>
STEWARD: Come now, Father. You should know better. You're not welcome
here, and especially not today. I've got no time to start old
arguments. <br>
ANGELO: We want only one thing. <br>
STEWARD: And what would that be? <br>
ANGELO: This house. <br>
STEWARD: You want the house? <br>
ANGELO: We will take the house. <br>
STEWARD: Would you like my wife while you're at it? <br>
ANGELO: If you won't stand aside, then we'll take it by force. <br>
STEWARD: By what power? The Hand of God? <br>
ANGELO: No. The Fist of Man. <br>
(The holy father fights like an eastern martial arts master, using his
long staff to good effect. At his signal, the other monks drop their
homespun robes to reveal that each of them is bald and wearing a red
Gi. They take on and defeat the rest of the men, complete with Matrix
style slow motion leaps. Then they go into the house, taking most of
the rest of the servants prisoner.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The servants are chained up in a cellar, along
with their mistress.) <br>
STEWARD: In the name of Heaven. My Lady? <br>
(The monks wheel a covered crate down the slope into the cellar.) <br>
STEWARD: What's in there? What is it, what's under the canvas? Father,
answer me. What's in there? <br>
ANGELO: May God forgive me. <br>
(The canvas is removed and the monks leave. The captives scream.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Rose has changed into denim mini-dungarees). <br>
ROSE: What do you think of this? Will it do? <br>
DOCTOR: In the late 1970s? You'd be better off in a bin bag. Hold on,
listen to this. <br>
(The Doctor puts a CD into the Tardis player.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ian Dury and the Blockheads. Number One in 1979. <br>
ROSE: You're a punk. <br>
DOCTOR: It's good to be a lunatic. <br>
ROSE: That's what you are. A big old punk with a bit of rockabillly
thrown in. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you like to see him? <br>
ROSE: How'd you mean? In concert? <br>
DOCTOR: What else is a Tardis for? I can take you to the Battle of
Trafalgar, the first anti-gravity Olympics, Caesar crossing the Rubicon
or Ian Dury at the Top Rank, Sheffield, England, Earth, 21st November,
1979. What do you think? <br>
ROSE: Sheffield it is. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on tight. <br>
(The Doctor beats the rhythm of the song on the console as they
travel.) <br>
ROSE: Stop! <br>
(They stop suddenly, and get thrown to the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: 1979. Hell of a year. China invades Vietnam. The Muppet Movie.
Love that film. Margaret Thatcher. Urgh. Skylab falls to Earth, with a
little help from me. Nearly took off my thumb. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Highlands]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: And I like my thumb. I need my thumb. I'm
very attached to <br>
(Rifles are cocked.) <br>
DOCTOR: My thumb. <br>
(They are surrounded by Redcoats. The officer in charge is on a black
horse.) <br>
DOCTOR: 1879. Same difference. <br>
REYNOLDS: You will explain your presence. And the nakedness of this
girl. <br>
(David reverts to his natural accent.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are we in Scotland? <br>
REYNOLDS: How can you be ignorant of that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm, I'm dazed and confused. I've been chasing this, this
wee naked child over hill and over dale. Isn't that right, ya timorous
beastie? <br>
ROSE: Och, aye! I've been oot and aboot. <br>
DOCTOR: No, don't do that. <br>
ROSE: Hoots mon. <br>
DOCTOR: No, really don't. Really. <br>
REYNOLDS: Will you identify yourself, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm Doctor James McCrimmon, from the township of Balamory. I
have my credentials, if I may. <br>
(He gets out his psychic paper.) <br>
DOCTOR: As you can see, a Doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. I
trained under Doctor Bell himself. <br>
(An upper-class English accent comes from a carriage nearby.) <br>
VICTORIA [OC]: Let them approach. <br>
REYNOLDS: I don't think that's wise, ma'am. <br>
VICTORIA [OC]: Let them approach. <br>
REYNOLDS: You will approach the carriage, and show all due deference. <br>
(A footman opens the door to reveal the Imperial Widow.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, might I introduce her Majesty Queen Victoria. Empress of
India and Defender of the Faith. <br>
ROSE: Rose Tyler, Ma'am. And my apologies for being so naked. <br>
VICTORIA: I've had five daughters. It's nothing to me. But you, Doctor.
Show me these credentials. <br>
(He hands her the psychic paper.) <br>
VICTORIA: Why didn't you say so immediately? It states clearly here
that you have been appointed by the Lord Provost as my Protector. <br>
DOCTOR: Does it? Yes, it does. Good. Good. Then let me ask - why is
Your Majesty travelling by road when there's a train all the way to
Aberdeen? <br>
VICTORIA: A tree on the line. <br>
DOCTOR: An accident? <br>
VICTORIA: I am the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland. Everything around me tends to be planned. <br>
DOCTOR: An assassination attempt? <br>
ROSE: What, seriously? There's people out to kill you? <br>
VICTORIA: I'm quite used to staring down the barrel of a gun. <br>
REYNOLDS: Sir Robert MacLeish lives but ten miles hence. We've sent
word ahead. He'll shelter us for tonight, then we can reach Balmoral
tomorrow. <br>
VICTORIA: This Doctor and his timorous beastie will come with us. <br>
REYNOLDS: Yes, Ma'am. We'd better get moving - it's almost nightfall. <br>
VICTORIA: Indeed. And there are stories of wolves in these parts.
Fanciful tales intended to scare the children. But good for the blood,
I think. Drive on! <br>
(The Doctor and Rose walk with the soldiers behind the carriage.) <br>
ROSE: It's funny though, because you say assassination and you just
think of Kennedy and stuff. Not her. <br>
DOCTOR: 1879? She's had, oh, six attempts on her life? And I'll tell
you something else. We just met Queen Victoria! <br>
ROSE: I know! <br>
DOCTOR: What a laugh! <br>
ROSE: She was just sitting there. <br>
DOCTOR: Like a stamp. <br>
ROSE: I want her to say we are not amused. I bet you five quid I can
make her say it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if I gambled on that, it'd be an abuse of my privileges
of traveller in time. <br>
ROSE: Ten quid? <br>
DOCTOR: Done.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(We finally see the grand granite edifice that owns
the courtyard. It has a large astronomical observatory on the roof. The
master of the house watches the Royal procession enter the courtyard
from an upstairs window.) <br>
ROBERT: I can't do this. It's treason. <br>
(Father Angelo is dressed as a butler.) <br>
ANGELO: Then your wife will suffer the consequences. And believe me,
Sir Robert, she will be devoured. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Courtyard]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sir Robert comes out to meet Queen Victoria. The
rest of the monks are also dressed as indoor servants.) <br>
ROBERT: Your Majesty. <br>
VICTORIA: Sir Robert. My apologies for the emergency. And how is Lady
Isobel? <br>
ROBERT: She's indisposed, I'm afraid. She's gone to Edinburgh for the
season. And she's taken the cook with her. The kitchens are barely
stocked. I wouldn't blame Your Majesty if you wanted to ride on. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, not at all. I've had quite enough carriage exercise. And
this is charming, if rustic. It's my first visit to this house. My late
husband spoke of it often. The Torchwood Estate. Now, shall we go
inside? And please excuse the naked girl. <br>
ROSE: Sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: She's a feral child. I bought her for sixpence in old London
Town. It's was her or the Elephant Man, so <br>
ROSE: Thinks he's funny but I'm so not amused. What do you think,
Ma'am? <br>
VICTORIA: It hardly matters. Shall we proceed? <br>
ROSE: So close. <br>
(Queen Victoria goes inside.) <br>
REYNOLDS: Makerson and Ramsey, you will escort the property. Hurry up. <br>
SOLDIERS: Yes, sir. <br>
(They take a small locked box from the carriage and carry it into the
house.) <br>
DOCTOR: So what's in there, then? <br>
REYNOLDS: Property of the Crown. You will dismiss any further thoughts,
sir. The rest of you go to the rear of the house. Assume your
designated positions. <br>
SOLDIER: You heard the orders. Positions. SOLDIER 2: Sir. <br>
(The shadows of the solders pass the cellar lights. A cloaked figure in
the cage makes the Shush gesture to the captives.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(One of the soldiers places the wooden box inside
an iron lattice crate.) <br>
REYNOLDS: Guard it with your life. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VICTORIA: This, I take it, is the famous Endeavour.
<br>
(A massive bronze telescope.) <br>
ROBERT: All my father's work. Built by hand in his final years. Became
something of an obsession. He spent his money on this rather than
caring for the house or himself. <br>
DOCTOR: I wish I'd met him. I like him. That thing's beautiful. Can I? <br>
ROBERT: Help yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: What did he model it on? <br>
ROBERT: I know nothing about it. To be honest, most of us thought him a
little, shall we say, eccentric. I wish now I'd spent more time with
him and listened to his stories. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a bit rubbish. How many prisms has it got? Way too many.
The magnification's gone right over the top. That's stupid kind of (to
Rose) Am I being rude again? <br>
ROSE: Yep. <br>
DOCTOR: But it's pretty. It's very pretty. <br>
VICTORIA: And the imagination of it should be applauded. <br>
ROSE: Mmm. Thought you might disapprove, Your Majesty. Stargazing.
Isn't that a bit fanciful? You could easily not be amused, or
something? No? <br>
VICTORIA: This device surveys the infinite work of God. What could be
finer? Sir Robert's father was an example to us all. A polymath,
steeped in astronomy and sciences, yet equally well versed in folklore
and fairytales. <br>
DOCTOR: Stars and magic. I like him more and more. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, my late husband enjoyed his company. Prince Albert
himself was acquainted with many rural superstitions, coming as he did
from Saxe Coburg. <br>
DOCTOR: That's Bavaria. <br>
VICTORIA: When Albert was told about your local wolf, he was
transported. <br>
DOCTOR: So, what's this wolf, then? <br>
ROBERT: It's just a story. <br>
DOCTOR: Then tell it. <br>
ROBERT: It's said that <br>
ANGELO: Excuse me, sir. Perhaps her Majesty's party could repair to
their rooms. It's almost dark. <br>
ROBERT: Of course. Yes, of course. <br>
VICTORIA: And then supper. And could we find some clothes for Miss
Tyler? I'm tired of nakedness. <br>
ROSE: It's not amusing, is it? <br>
VICTORIA: Sir Robert, your wife must have left some clothes. See to it.
We shall dine at seven, and talk some more of this wolf. After all,
there is a full moon tonight. <br>
ROBERT: So there is, Ma'am.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Rose explores the contents of a wardrobe. <br>
Downstairs in the kitchen, the monks are making a brew with mistletoe,
under the watchful gaze of Father Angelo. <br>
Rose finds a blue velvet dress that is to her liking. <br>
The monks serve mugs of their special brew to the soldiers on guard. <br>
Rose opens another cupboard and discovers a housemaid. <br>
The soldiers fall down. The monks take their weapons.) <br>
FLORA: They came through the house. In the excitement they took the
Steward and the Master, and my Lady. <br>
ROSE: Listen. I've got a friend. He's called the Doctor. He'll know
what to do. You've
got to come with me. <br>
FLORA: Oh, but I can't, Miss. <br>
ROSE: What's your name? <br>
FLORA: Flora. <br>
ROSE: Flora, we'll be safe. There's more people arrived downstairs,
soldiers and everything, and they can help us. I promise. Come on.
Okay? Come on.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Around the corner they find one of the soldiers
lying on the floor.) <br>
FLORA: Oh, Miss. I did warn you. <br>
ROSE: He's not dead. I don't think, he must be drugged or something. <br>
(Father Angelo grabs Flora from behind and drags her away. Another
takes Rose and a third removes the soldier.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ANGELO: Your companion begs an apology, Doctor. Her
clothing has somewhat delayed her. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's all right. Save her a wee bit of ham. <br>
VICTORIA: The feral child could probably eat it raw. <br>
REYNOLDS: Very wise, Ma'am. Very witty. <br>
VICTORIA: Slightly witty, perhaps. I know you rarely get the chance to
dine with me, Captain, but don't get too excited. I shall contain my
wit in case I do you further injury. <br>
REYNOLDS: Yes, Ma'am. Sorry, Ma'am. <br>
DOCTOR: Besides, we're all waiting on Sir Robert. Come, sir. You
promised us a tale of nightmares. <br>
VICTORIA: Indeed. Since my husband's death, I find myself with more of
a taste for supernatural fiction. <br>
DOCTOR: You must miss him. <br>
VICTORIA: Very much. Oh, completely. And that's the charm of a ghost
story, isn't it? Not the scares and chills, that's just for children,
but the hope of some contact with the great beyond. We all want some
message from that place. It's the Creator's greatest mystery that we're
allowed no such consolation. The dead stay silent, and we must wait.
Come. Begin your tale, Sir Robert. There's a chill in the air. The wind
is howling through the eaves. Tell us of monsters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cellar]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The young monk in the cage is sitting quietly.) <br>
ISOBEL: Don't make a sound. They said if we scream or shout, then he
will slaughter us. <br>
ROSE: But he's in a cage. He's a prisoner. He's the same as us. <br>
ISOBEL: He's nothing like us. That creature is not mortal. <br>
(The young man opens his eyes. They are completely black.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Dining room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROBERT: The story goes back three hundred years.
Every full moon, the howling rings through the valley. The next
morning, livestock is found ripped apart and devoured. <br>
REYNOLDS: Tales like this just disguise the work of thieves. Steal a
sheep and blame a wolf, simple as that. <br>
ROBERT: But sometimes a child goes missing. Once in a generation, a boy
will vanish from his homestead. </font></p>

as the chain will let her.) <br>

ROSE: Who are you? <br>
STEWARD: Don't enrage him. <br>
ROSE: Where are you from? You're not from Earth. What planet are you
from? <br>
WEREWOLF: Oh, intelligence. <br>
ROSE: Where were you born? <br>
WEREWOLF: This body? Ten miles away. A weakling, heartsick boy, stolen
away at night by the brethren for my cultivation. I carved out his soul
and sat in his heart. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Dining room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Are there descriptions of the creature? <br>
ROBERT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Drawings and woodcarvings. And it's not merely
a wolf. It's more than that. This is a man who becomes an animal. <br>
DOCTOR: A werewolf? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Cellar]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: All right, so the body's human. But what
about you, the thing inside? <br>
WEREWOLF: So far from home. <br>
ROSE: If you want to get back home, we can help. <br>
WEREWOLF: Why would I leave this place? A world of industry, of
workforce and warfare. I could turn it to such purpose. <br>
ROSE: How would you do that? <br>
WEREWOLF: I would migrate to the Holy Monarch. <br>
ROSE: You mean Queen Victoria? <br>
WEREWOLF: With one bite, I would pass into her blood, and then it
begins. The Empire of the Wolf. Many questions. <br>
(The young man lunges at the crate.) <br>
WEREWOLF: Look. Inside your eyes. You've seen it too. <br>
ROSE: Seen what? <br>
WEREWOLF: The Wolf. There is something of the Wolf about you. <br>
ROSE: I don't know what you mean. <br>
WEREWOLF: You burnt like the sun, but all I require is the moon. </font></p>

ROBERT: My father didn't treat it as a story. He said it was fact. He
even claimed to have communed with the beast, to have learned its
purpose. I should have listened. His work was hindered. He made
enemies. There's a monastery in the Glen of Saint Catherine. The
Brethren opposed my father's investigations. <br>
(Angelo gazes out at the moon and starts chanting lupus deus est.) <br>
VICTORIA: Perhaps they thought his work ungodly. <br>
ROBERT: That's what I thought. But now I wonder. What if they had a
different reason for wanting the story kept quiet? What if they turned
from God and worshipped the wolf? <br>
DOCTOR: And what if they were with us right now?

through the cellar.) <br>
ROSE: All of you! Stop looking at it! Flora, don't look. Listen to me.
Grab hold of the chain and pull! Come on! With me! Pull! <br>

VICTORIA: I heard such terrible noises. <br>
ROBERT: Your Majesty, we've got to get out. But what of Father Angelo?
Is he still here? <br>
VICTORIA: Captain Reynolds disposed of him. <br>
DOCTOR: The front door's no good, it's been boarded shut. Pardon me,
Your Majesty. You'll have to leg it out of a window. </font></p>

first, the better to assist Her Majesty's egress. <br>
VICTORIA: A noble sentiment, my Sir Walter Raleigh. <br>
(The Doctor regains his London accent.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, any chance you could hurry up? <br>
(Robert opens the window and the monks outside open fire.) <br>
DOCTOR: I reckon the monkey boys want us to stay inside. <br>
VICTORIA: Do they know who I am?? <br>
ROSE: Yeah, that's why they want you. The wolf's lined you up for a, a
biting. <br>
VICTORIA: Stop this talk. There can't be an actual wolf. <br>

ROSE: Is that it? <br>

ROSE: Not on me, no. <br>

REYNOLDS: I'll take this position and hold it. You keep moving, for

taken. The chest was empty. <br>
VICTORIA: I have it. It's safe. <br>
REYNOLDS: Then remove yourself, Ma'am. Doctor, you stand as Her
Majesty's Protector. And you, Sir Robert, you're a traitor to the

DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Shush, shush, wait a minute. <br>
(There is one lonely howl.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's stopped. <br>
(The werewolf sniffs at the door, then leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's gone. <br>
ROSE: Listen. <br>
(There are footsteps and growls from outside the walls as it walks
around the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is this the only door? <br>
ROBERT: Yes. No! <br>
(They quickly barricade the other door.) <br>
ROSE: Shush. <br>

ROSE: I don't understand. What's stopping it? <br>
DOCTOR: Something inside this room. What is it? Why can't it get in? <br>
ROSE: I'll tell you what, though. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROSE: Werewolf. <br>
DOCTOR: I know. You all right? <br>
ROSE: I'm okay, yeah. <br>
ROBERT: I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's all my fault. I should have sent you
away. I tried to suggest something was wrong. I thought you might
notice. Did you think there was nothing strange about my household
staff? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they were bald, athletic. Your wife's away, I just
thought you were happy. <br>
ROSE: I'll tell you what though, Ma'am, I bet you're not amused now. <br>
VICTORIA: Do you think this is funny? <br>
ROSE: No, Ma'am. I'm sorry. <br>
VICTORIA: What, exactly, I pray tell me, someone, please. What exactly
is that creature? <br>
DOCTOR: You'd call it a werewolf, but technically it's a more of a
lupine wavelength haemovariform. <br>
VICTORIA: And should I trust you, sir? You who change your voice so
easily? What happened to your accent? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh right, sorry, that's <br>
VICTORIA: I'll not have it. No, sir. Not you, not that thing, none of

of the guarding monks.) <br>
ISOBEL: Mistletoe. They're all garlanded in mistletoe and the wolf
doesn't attack them. Who brought this into the kitchen? <br>

DOCTOR: Mistletoe. Sir Robert, did you father put that there? <br>
ROBERT: I don't know. I suppose. <br>
DOCTOR: On the other door, too. No, a carving wouldn't be enough. I
wonder. <br>
(He licks the woodwork.) <br>
DOCTOR: Viscum album, the oil of the mistletoe. It's been worked into
the wood like a varnish. How clever was your dad? I love him. Powerful
stuff, mistletoe. Bursting with lectins and viscotoxins. <br>
ROSE: And the wolf's allergic to it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it thinks it is. The monkey monk monks need a way of
controlling the wolf, maybe they trained it to react against certain
things. <br>
ROBERT: Nevertheless, that creature won't give up, Doctor, and we still
don't possess an actual weapon. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, your father got all the brains, didn't he? <br>
ROSE: Being rude again. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. I meant that one. You want weapons? We're in a library.
Books! Best weapons in the world. This room's the greatest arsenal we
could have. <br>

there's any chance he's still alive, then by God, I'll assist him. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: Biology, zoology. There might be something on
wolves in here <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on, what about this? A book on mistletoe. <br>
ROSE: A book on magic. <br>
ROBERT: Some form of explosive. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, that's the sort of thing.<br>
ROSE: Wolf's bane, what about that? <br>
DOCTOR: Look what your old dad found. Something fell to Earth. <br>
ROSE: A spaceship? <br>
ROBERT: A shooting star. (reads) In the year of our Lord 1540, under
the reign of King James the Fifth, an almighty fire did burn in the
pit. That's the Glen of Saint Catherine just by the monastery. <br>
ROSE: But that's over three hundred years ago. What's it been waiting
for? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe just a single cell survived. Adapting slowly down the
generations, it survived through the humans, host after host after
host. <br>
ROBERT: But why does it want the throne? <br>
ROSE: That's what it wants. It said so. The, the Empire of the Wolf. <br>
DOCTOR: Imagine it. The Victorian Age accelerated. Starships and
missiles fueled by coal and driven by steam, leaving history devastated
in its wake <br>
VICTORIA: Sir Robert. If I am to die here. <br>
ROBERT: Don't say that, Your Majesty. <br>
VICTORIA: I would destroy myself rather than let that creature infect
me. But that's no matter. I ask only that you find some place of
safekeeping for something far older and more precious than myself. <br>
DOCTOR: Hardly the time to worry about your valuables. <br>
VICTORIA: Thank you for your opinion, but there is nothing more
valuable than this. <br>
(A finest white 105.6 carat diamond.) <br>
ROSE: Is that the Koh-I-Noor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. The greatest diamond in the world. <br>
VICTORIA: Given to me as the spoils of war. Perhaps its legend is now
coming true. It is said that whoever owns it must surely die. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's true of anything if you own it long enough. Can I?
<br>
(The Doctor examines the diamond.) <br>
DOCTOR: That is so beautiful. <br>
ROSE: How much is that worth? <br>
DOCTOR: They say the wages of the entire planet for a whole week. <br>
ROSE: Good job my mum's not here. She'd be fighting the wolf off with
her bare hands for that thing. <br>
DOCTOR: And she'd win. <br>
ROBERT: Where is the wolf? I don't trust this silence. <br>
DOCTOR: Why do you travel with it? <br>
VICTORIA: My annual pilgrimage. I'm taking it to Helier and Carew, the
Royal Jewellers at Hazelhead. The stone needs recutting. <br>
ROSE: Oh, but it's perfect. <br>
VICTORIA: My late husband never thought so. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, there's a fact. Prince Albert kept on having the
Koh-I-Noor cut down. It used to be forty percent bigger than this. But
he was never happy. Kept on cutting and cutting. <br>
VICTORIA: He always said the shine was not quite right. But he died
with it still unfinished. <br>
DOCTOR: Unfinished. Oh, yes. <br>
(He throws the stone back to Victoria.) <br>
DOCTOR: There's a lot of unfinished business in this house. His
father's research, and your husband, Ma'am, he came here and he sought
the perfect diamond. Hold on, hold on. All these separate things,
they're not separate at all, they're connected. Oh, my head, my head.
What if this house, it's a trap for you. Is that right, Ma'am? <br>
VICTORIA: Obviously. <br>
DOCTOR: At least, that's what the wolf intended. But, what if there's a
trap inside the trap? <br>
VICTORIA: Explain yourself, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What if his father and your husband weren't just telling each
other stories. They dared to imagine all this was true, and they
planned against it, laying the real trap not for you but for the wolf. <br>
(Plaster dust falls from the ceiling. They look up to the domes

DOCTOR: That wolf there. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: You said this thing doesn't work. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't work as a telescope because that's not what it is.
It's a light chamber. It magnifies the light rays like a weapon. We've
just got to power it up. <br>
ROSE: It won't work. There's no electricity. Moonlight. But the wolf
needs moonlight. It's made by moonlight. <br>
DOCTOR: You're seventy percent water but you can still drown. Come on!
Come on! <br>
(The moon shines down into the telescope lens and bounces between the
prisms, magnifying as it goes. The werewolf breaks in and goes for
Queen Victoria. The Doctor slides the diamond over to where the light
hits the floor. It refracts upwards, catching the werewolf in its beam
and lifting it up off the floor. The wolf turns back into a young man,
hanging as if crucified in mid air.) <br>
WEREWOLF: Make it brighter. Let me go. <br>
(The Doctor adjusts the magnification on the eyepiece. The man turns
back into a wolf shape, howls and vanishes. Victoria looks at a small
scratch on her wrist.) <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty? Did it bite you? <br>
VICTORIA: No, it's, it's a cut, that's all. <br>

DOCTOR: Many thanks, Ma'am. <br>
ROSE: Thanks. They're never going to believe this back home. <br>

your life. He's protecting you even now, Ma'am, from beyond the grave. <br>

amused. <br>
ROSE: Yes! <br>
VICTORIA: Not remotely amused. And henceforth I banish you. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry? <br>
VICTORIA: I have rewarded you, Sir Doctor, and now you are exiled from this
empire, never to return. I don't know what you are, the two of you, or
where you're from, but I know that you consort with stars and magic and
think it fun. But your world is steeped in terror and blasphemy and
death, and I will not allow it. You will leave these shores and you will
reflect, I hope, on how you came to stray so far from all that is good,
and how much longer you may survive this terrible life. Now leave my

DOCTOR: Cheers, Dougal! <br>
DOUGAL: Walk on. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but the funny thing is, Queen Victoria did actually suffer
a mutation of the blood. It's historical record. She was
haemophiliac. They used to call it the Royal Disease. But it's always
been a mystery because she didn't inherit it. Her mum didn't have it,
her dad didn't have it. It came from nowhere. <br>
ROSE: What, and you're saying that's a wolf bite? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, maybe haemophilia is just a Victorian euphemism. <br>
ROSE: For werewolf? <br>
DOCTOR: Could be. <br>
ROSE: Queen Victoria's a werewolf? <br>
DOCTOR: Could be. And her children had the Royal Disease. Maybe she
gave them a quick nip. <br>
ROSE: So, the Royal Family are werewolves? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, maybe not yet. I mean, a single wolf cell could take a
hundred years to mature. Might be ready by, oh, early 21st century? <br>
ROSE: Nah, that's just ridiculous! Mind you, Princess Anne. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll say no more. <br>

everything in advance. They could schedule themselves around the moon.
