Gateway entrance to Dover Castle, currently masquerading as HM Prison
Stangmoor, and parks on the drawbridge.) <br>
JO: It looks like Dracula's castle. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you're right about the castle bit. It used to be a
fortress in the Middle Ages. <br>
JO: Doctor? You'll need this. <br>
(Jo gives him an ID pass.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thanks, Jo. <br>
(The Doctor rings the entrance bell.) <br>
DOCTOR: Smile, Jo. <br>
JO: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You're on camera. <br>
(The Doctor waves at the CCTV, and the personnel in the security room
stare at the crazy man on the monitor. A prison officer comes out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good morning. Er, observers from UNIT. My admission pass. <br>
OFFICER: (into R/T) Right. Passes checked and satisfactory. Right, open
the gates. <br>
(The Doctor gets back into Bessie.) <br>
DOCTOR: Abandon hope all ye who enter here. <br>

noise in their cells which masks some dialogue. A central staircase
leads up to a catwalk. By a glass brick wall is a door labelled Process
Theatre.) <br>
POWERS: Green! Calm the men down. The Governor's on his way. <br>
(Green goes up the stairs.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Morning, Chief. Everything all right? <br>
POWERS: Will be, sir. <br>
GOVERNOR: Good, good. Well, let's see to it. <br>

white lab coat, go up the stairs and are let through a gate to another
corridor leading to steps downwards.) KETTERING: Why do they always
have to make that stupid row? <br>
SUMMERS: It always happens when sentences are being carried out.

when the party enters.) <br>
GOVERNOR: George Patrick Barnham. <br>
BARNHAM: No, you're not going to take me anywhere! <br>
GOVERNOR: You have been sentenced by a court of law. <br>
BARNHAM: Get away from me! <br>
GOVERNOR: The time has come for that sentence to be carried out. <br>
BARNHAM: Go on! Get out! All of you! <br>
SUMMERS: I'll give him something to calm him. <br>
BARNHAM: You won't give me nothing, mate. Get out, all of you! <br>
POWERS: Pack it in, Barnham. You're just being stupid. <br>
BARNHAM: You're not going to get me out there! <br>
POWERS: Get him! <br>
(The two guards grab Barnham.) <br>
GOVERNOR: All right. <br>
GUARD: You come easy. <br>
BARNHAM: Take it easy, you'll break me arm. <br>
(Protesting loudly, Barnham is manhandled up the short staircase.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (It is not just Jo and the Doctor who are gathered
to observe something. There is a whole gaggle of men with clipboards
sitting around.) <br>
GREEN: Sorry about the noise, ladies and gentlemen. Just a temporary
disturbance. <br>
JO: Temporary disturbance? It sounds like a full-scale riot. <br>
DOCTOR: Morbid lot of sensation seekers. <br>
JO: Then why did you insist on coming here? <br>
DOCTOR: Scientific curiosity, my dear. <br>
JO: Oh, yes. <br>
(Everyone sits down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Something's been worrying me about this Keller process ever
since I first heard of it. Ah, the curtain is about to go up. <br>
(The Governor, Kettering and Powers enter.) <br>
POWERS: Keep them quiet. <br>
GREEN: All right, chief. <br>
(Green leaves.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. <br>
DOCTOR: Good morning. <br>
GOVERNOR: May I introduce Professor Kettering, who will explain the
process you're about to see demonstrated. <br>
KETTERING: Well, as you're no doubt aware, we no longer execute our
hardened criminals and killers. Modern society has progressed far
beyond that primitive form of retribution. Today, science <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) It all depends what you mean by progress, doesn't it. <br>
KETTERING: Science has abolished the hangman's noose and substituted
this infallible method. Professor Emil Keller <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) People who talk about infallibility are usually on very
shaky ground, I think. <br>
KETTERING: For the benefit of the less sophisticated members of my
audience, I will explain in very simple terms. Professor Emil Keller,
the inventor of this process, discovered that anti-social behaviour was
governed by certain negative or evil impulses. Now this machine, the
Keller machine, extracts these impulses and leaves a rational,
well-balanced individual. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't. <br>
JO: What? <br>
KETTERING: May I be permitted to continue? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes, please do. <br>
KETTERING: Thank you. The condemned man is placed here (in a chair)
after being tranquillised, with his head under this dome. A series of
probes are attached to his skull so as to connect with the neural
circuits. The extraction process is controlled here. The negative
impulses are stored in that reservoir box there. <br>
DOCTOR: Where do they go after that? <br>
KETTERING: Nowhere, sir. I repeat, they are stored in the box. <br>
DOCTOR: Which is now full of these negative or evil impulses. <br>
KETTERING: Not full. The indicator registers only sixty five percent at
this time. The machine has been used very successfully in Switzerland.
A hundred and twelve cases have been processed to date and today we
shall witness the one hundred and thirteenth. Thank you, Doctor
Summers. <br>
(Barnham is wheeled in on a gurney, drugged and in an operating gown.) <br>
SUMMERS: Come on, old chap. Up you get. <br>
(Barnham is helped into the chair and a metal cap fastened to his
head.) <br>
KETTERING: When the process is completed, the negative impulses that
made this man a criminal will have been removed. He will take his place
as a useful, if lowly, member of society. Are you ready, Doctor
Summers? <br>
SUMMERS: Yes. <br>
(Kettering adjusts the machine that holds the reservoir box then goes
to the main control panel and flicks switches. He nods to the
Governor.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Let the sentence of the Court been carried out. <br>
(The lights go down, leaving Barnham in a spotlight. The machine starts
pulsing. Barnham screams.) <br>
DOCTOR: I knew there was something evil about that machine. <br>
SUMMERS: Kettering! Look at the dial. <br>
KETTERING: What of it? <br>
SUMMERS: It's never registered so high before. <br>
(Summers checks Barnham for a heart beat.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Mister Kettering, what's happening? <br>
(Kettering turns off the machine and the lights come back up.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Well? <br>
KETTERING: A minor malfunction. The machine compensated. The process is
completed satisfactorily. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Satisfactorily be blowed. <br>
KETTERING: The subject will be taken away to recuperate and within an
hour or two he will be perfectly normal. <br>
DOCTOR: I admire your confidence, sir. <br>
KETTERING: Thank you. That is all, gentlemen. <br>
(As the observers leave, the Doctor goes over to the Governor and
Kettering.) <br>
GOVERNOR: I take it everything was all right, Mister Kettering? <br>
KETTERING: Yes, of course, Governor. <br>
DOCTOR: Then would you kindly explain, sir, that unfortunate man's
reaction? <br>
KETTERING: An excess of negative particles. The machine overreacted. <br>
DOCTOR: In other words, you don't know. <br>
KETTERING: May I ask who you are, sir? <br>
GOVERNOR: The Doctor is Scientific Advisor to UNIT, Mister Kettering. <br>
KETTERING: UNIT? <br>
GOVERNOR: United Nations Intelligence Taskforce. <br>
KETTERING: How interesting, though I fail to see what concern it is <br>
DOCTOR: UNIT, sir, was set up to deal with new and unusual menaces to
mankind. And in my view, this machine of yours is just that. Jo.

SUMMERS: Right. <br>

KETTERING: Well? <br>
SUMMERS: Nothing much wrong physically. Respiration normal, pulse
rate's a little high but that's usual after the process. <br>
KETTERING: Ah, exactly. A completely successful treatment. <br>
SUMMERS: The reaction was unusually violent. <br>
KETTERING: Really, my dear Summers, you're as bad as that interfering

his wallet as Summers and the orderlies enter.) <br>
SUMMERS: What happened? <br>
GREEN: I don't know, sir. <br>
GOVERNOR: What happened? <br>
GREEN: I don't know, sir. I was coming along the corridor and I heard
him screaming. <br>
DOCTOR: Is he dead? <br>
SUMMERS: Yes, he's dead. <br>
KETTERING: Probably a heart attack. Delayed shock from seeing the
process. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps, but I doubt it. Might I suggest an immediate
investigation into his past medical history and a post mortem. <br>
SUMMERS: Yes. Yes, a good idea. I'll see to it right away. Get a
stretcher, will you? <br>
(Summers leaves.) <br>
JO: Doctor? Did you see his face? He looks terrified. And those marks,
like <br>
DOCTOR: Bites and scratches? Yes, I know. <br>
JO: Look, I think we'd better get on to the Brigadier. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I agree, Jo, but not just yet. Now, let me get that post
mortem first. It'll give me more to go on. <br>
JO: All right. Anyway, I don't think he'd thank us for disturbing him
right now. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
JO: He did tell you all about it, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: All about what? <br>
JO: Today's the first ever World Peace Conference. UNIT's handling all
the security arrangements.

posh room with big double doors, fancy fireplace and large potted
ficus.) <br>
BRIGADIER: (on phone) Yes, that's all very well, sir, but in my
opinion. <br>
(Yates enters.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I see, sir. Of course, sir. I take it that is your
final decision? Very well, sir, goodbye. <br>
YATES: Trouble, sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: That was the Ministry. UNIT'll be responsible for the safe
transport of the missile. It's been cleared with Geneva. <br>
YATES: Well, that's all we needed. What with the peace conference on
our hands as well. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes. I want you to take charge of this escort detail,
Captain Yates. I've got quite enough on my plate as it is. <br>
YATES: I'll get onto it right away. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, is the Doctor back from Stangmoor yet? <br>
YATES: No sir. Er, what exactly is he doing down there? <br>
BRIGADIER: Observing new development in the treatment of criminals, I
believe. Oh well, I suppose it'll keep him out of mischief. By the way,
how are things at the conference? <br>
YATES: Oh, all running smoothly, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: I only hope it lasts. <br>
(A Chinese woman officer bursts in, followed by a female UNIT officer -
Bell.) <br>
BRIGADIER: All right, Corporal Bell. Yes, Captain Chin Lee, what can I
do for you? <br>
CHIN LEE: Brigadier, an outrage has been committed against the Chinese
people's delegation. As you are in charge of security arrangements, we
hold you directly responsible. <br>
BRIGADIER: What is it now, Captain? <br>
CHIN LEE: Important state documents have been stolen from General Cheng
Teik's suite. <br>
YATES: That's impossible. There's a twenty four hour guard on all the
delegate's suites. <br>
CHIN LEE: Nevertheless, the theft has occurred. Your guards are
inefficient. Perhaps they take bribes? <br>
BRIGADIER: That is an insulting suggestion, Captain. I will not
tolerate any! Very well, Captain, I'll investigate the matter
immediately. <br>
CHIN LEE: I must warn you that this puts the success of the peace
conference in grave jeopardy. We suspect the imperialist Americans of
this crime. <br>
BRIGADIER: Naturally. I assure you that every effort will be made to
locate the missing papers and to punish whoever is responsible. <br>
CHIN LEE: Any further trouble and our delegation will withdraw from
this conference. <br>
(Chin Lee leaves.) <br>
BRIGADIER: More trouble. <br>
YATES: Mmm, pity. She's quite a dolly. <br>
(Chin Lee leaves 24 Cornwall Gardens and walks straight past the
limousine waiting for her. She goes to the Green in middle of the area
and takes a document from her jacket. She removes it's ribbon and sets
fire to it then drops it into a waste paper basket at the last moment.
Then she flinches and touches a round metal device just behind her
right ear before leaving the scene.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: And you are still convinced this Keller
process is working normally? <br>
KETTERING: Yes, of course it is. I mean, you've just seen Barnham. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've seen him. <br>
KETTERING: Look, Emil Keller himself installed it here. I worked
closely with him. I know every facet of the process. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But I still don't like it. <br>
GOVERNOR: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Interfering with the mind, Governor. It's a dangerous business.
<br>
KETTERING: Well, it's hardly your concern, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Professor Kettering, it is everyone's concern! <br>
SUMMERS [OC]: After you. <br>
(Jo and Summers enter.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Ah, Doctor Summers. Any news for us? <br>
SUMMERS: I've got the post mortem report. <br>
KETTERING:: Well? <br>
SUMMERS: The deceased's name was Arthur Linwood, a medical student in
his final year. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, but what did he die of? <br>
SUMMERS: Heart failure. <br>
KETTERING: Watching the process was too much for him. <br>
SUMMERS: But he didn't have a weak heart, Mister Kettering. <br>
DOCTOR: Anything in his medical history? <br>
SUMMERS: Yes, I called his hospital. He suffered from a fear of certain
animals. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, which ones? <br>
SUMMERS: Well, apparently, in the laboratory he was absolutely
terrified of <br>
DOCTOR: Rats? <br>
SUMMERS: Yes.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, these marks on his face on his face and neck, these
bites and scratches, could they have been caused by rats? <br>
SUMMERS: Certainly they could, yes. <br>
GOVERNOR: But there are no rats in this room. There's none in the
entire prison. <br>
SUMMERS: Yet all the indications are that he was attacked by a hoard of
them, and the shock killed him. <br>
KETTERING: You must be mistaken. <br>
DOCTOR: But Linwood is dead. <br>
KETTERING: Because of heart failure! <br>
DOCTOR: No, Professor Kettering, because of this machine. <br>
KETTERING: I tell you that man's death had nothing to do with this
machine, and if you were a scientist you'd understand. <br>
DOCTOR: If I were a scientist? Let me tell you, sir, that I am a
scientist, and I have been for several thousand. Jo. <br>
(The Doctor leaves.) <br>
KETTERING: The man's mad. <br>
JO: On the contrary, sir, he happens to be a genius. I do wish you'd
listen to him. <br>
(Jo leaves.) <br>
SUMMERS: Victor? <br>
GOVERNOR: I think you'd better give this machine a thorough check,
Professor Kettering. <br>
KETTERING: Yes, of course, Governor. But I assure you there's no reason
for anxiety. <br>
GOVERNOR: All the same, better safe than sorry?

surprise me if she lost them herself. <br>

it's growing stronger. <br>
GOVERNOR: Oh, come now, Doctor. It's only a machine. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, maybe, but nevertheless it's dangerous and it should be
destroyed now! <br>

recommendations to the Home Office but they'll have to decide. <br>

that memory out of my mind and used it to attack me. <br>

over Barnham and makes his escape. The Doctor and Jo run back to their
fallen friend.) <br>
DOCTOR: He's dead. Come on, Jo. Jo, come on. <br>
(Jo and the Doctor get in the helicopter and it takes off.)

BRIGADIER: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one,
abort! <br>
(KaBOOM! goes the missile, the hangar, and presumably the Keller
machine and Barnham.)

BRIGADIER: Thank you. <br>
JO: We took Barnham there to help us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jo. I know. <br>
JO: We should never have left him there. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, how do you think I feel? <br>
JO: Sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Here, have some coffee. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, at least we're rid of the Keller machine, and the
Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we've probably killed off that machine all right, but I'm
not so sure about the Master. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, even if he wasn't killed, Doctor, he won't get far if
you've still got his circuit. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true. <br>
(The Doctor checks his pockets.) <br>
DOCTOR: The circuit. I must have lost it in my struggle with him. <br>
BRIGADIER: Probably destroyed in the explosion. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but what if it wasn't? Supposing the Master found it? <br>
(The telephone rings.) <br>
BENTON: Hello, Governor's office? <br>
MASTER [OC]: Put me on to the Doctor, will you? <br>
BENTON: Yes. It's for you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: The Master? Yes?

about me, so I thought I'd let you know that I'm alive and well.
