notice on the gate, but underground a scared man is making his way
along one of the worked out roadways. Welcome to post industrial

locals and into the Research Centre. Security keep the crowd back as a
man with a briefcase climbs out and is met by a middle management
type.) <br>
ELGIN: Welcome back, sir. What's the news? <br>
STEVENS: All good. How long has this been going on? <br>
ELGIN: Oh, since early this morning. They want to know what is going to
happen. We all do. <br>
STEVENS: In that case, I'll tell them. <br>
(Stevens steps onto the Range Rover's tail plate and addresses the
crowd.) <br>
STEVENS: I have in my hand a piece of paper which will mean a great
deal to all of you. Wealth in our time! <br>
(The crowd responds with derision. Meanwhile the frightened man in the
mine has made it back to the lift, and starts up. He notices that the
back of his right hand is glowing green.) <br>
STEVENS: When the National Coal Board were forced to close the pit last
year <br>
MAN: It were a shame, that was. <br>
STEVENS: No, my friends, we must not be bitter. We must face the facts.
Coal is a dying industry. <br>
MAN: Rubbish! Rubbish! <br>
STEVENS: Oil is our future now and the government agrees with me. They
have not only given us the go-ahead for our plans, they have promised
us money for future expansion! I have it here in black and white! <br>
(Cheers all round.) <br>
STEVENS: Money for all of us! More jobs, more housing, more cars! <br>
(The older folk cheer, but there is a group of long haired hippies off
to the side.) <br>
JONES: More muck! More devastation! More death! <br>
MAN: Why don't you shut up and listen. <br>
STEVENS: Who is that? What did he say? <br>
ELGIN: It's that Professor Jones. He's a troublemaker. <br>
STEVENS: The Nobel prize winner? <br>
ELGIN: Yes. Go easy, sir. He gets a lot of coverage in the press. <br>
STEVENS: It seems there are some who do not agree with my vision, the
future we hold in our hands. There are always those who resist
progress. <br>
JONES: Progress? Don't listen to him. He means fatter profits for
Global Chemicals. At the expense of your land! <br>
MAN: Ah, shut your face. <br>
JONES: The very air you breathe! Aye, and the health of you and your
kids! <br>
EVANS: It's all right for you. You can afford to live the way you want
to. We need the jobs. <br>
MILKMAN: Aye, we can't live on nuts, man. <br>
EVANS: We can't live on nuts. <br>
JONES: Can't you see you're being exploited? <br>
MILKMAN: Ah, shut up! <br>
EVANS: Shut up or we'll shut you up. <br>
STEVENS: No, wait, wait, my friends. Professor Jones is right. We must
all share his concern. I assure you that I and my fellow directors <br>

comes out of the Tardis with a circuit module. Jo says something with
her mouth full.) <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
JO: Sorry. I said is that the dematerialisation circuit? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. No more trouble there, thank goodness. I can now take
the Tardis wherever and whenever I like. I've got absolute control over
her. <br>
JO: Now that the Time Lords have forgiven you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. <br>
JO: What is it, then? <br>
DOCTOR: What, this? <br>
JO: Mmm. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this is the space time coordinate programmer. The
wretched thing's nearly worn out. That's the trouble with the Tardis.
She's getting on a bit, you know, Jo. <br>

DOCTOR: Look, must you? <br>
JO: I'm sorry. It's my breakfast. I said no wonder we never got to
Metebelis Three. <br>

DOCTOR: Protein's the thing for breakfast, Jo. <br>
JO: Eggs and bacon, yuk. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's where we're going to next. <br>

DOCTOR: Metebelis Three. The Tardis can't miss this time. I've actually
wired the coordinates into the programmer. <br>

JO: Oh no! No, they can't! <br>
DOCTOR: I can't wait to go there, you know, Jo. <br>
JO: It's criminal. Absolutely criminal.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: It must be a fascinating place. Just imagine it, a blue sun. <br>
JO: Listen. And at last the Ministry has given the green light to
Global Chemicals <br>
DOCTOR: No, not a green light, it's a blue light. Everything's blue
there. <br>
JO: Common sense has triumphed at last. Well, don't they realise the
pollution it will cause? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm, absolutely. <br>
JO: And the futile protests of Professor Jones <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I might even get a hold of one of those famous blue
sapphires. Well, there you are. That should do it, I think. <br>
JO: He won't give up, you know. A man like Professor Jones will never
give up. <br>
DOCTOR: Where are you off to? <br>
JO: To pack a suitcase. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good. Give me a couple of minutes and we'll be off. <br>
JO: Off? Off where? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Metebelis Three, of course. <br>
JO: I'm not going to Metebelis Three. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? Where are you thinking of going to? <br>
JO: Well, South Wales, of course. Llanfairfach. <br>

EVANS: Monthly inspection. Best prop forward we ever had. What killed
him? You're a doctor, Doctor Jones. <br>
JONES: I'm not, you know. I'm a biologist. Some sort of gas maybe? <br>
EVANS: But why has he turned green, man? <br>
JONES: I've no idea. Except <br>

fling me into a dungeon, I <br>

JO: Oh dear. Doctor, I mean it. I'm going to go to South Wales because
they have got to be stopped. <br>
BRIGADIER: Who's got to be stopped? <br>
JO: Well, Global Chemicals, of course. Can't you see the harm this go
ahead will do? <br>
BRIGADIER: No, Miss Grant, I can't. Cheap petrol and lots of it.
Exactly what the world needs. <br>
JO: No! No, look it's time to call a halt! It's time that the world
awoke to the alarm bell of pollution instead of sliding down the
slippery slopes of, of, of, whatever it is. <br>
DOCTOR: A very pretty mixed metaphor. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I seem to recognise the style. This fellow, Jones,
isn't it? The Nutcake Professor, isn't that what the papers call him? <br>
JO: That doesn't make him wrong, does it. <br>
BRIGADIER: And you want to go down there to help him in his noble fight
against the windmills, down to Llanfairfach. <br>
JO: I'm sorry, Brigadier. I'm going to go even if it means resigning
from UNIT. <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah. Well, we can discuss that on the way down, can't we? <br>

DOCTOR: I'm going to Metebelis Three. <br>
BRIGADIER: Wouldn't like to have to order you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't advise you to try. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes. Ten minutes, Miss Grant. <br>

DOCTOR: Metebelis Three, Jo? Where else would you like to go? You
choose for yourself. <br>
JO: But I've only got ten minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, you've got all the time in the world, and all the space.
I'm offering them to you. <br>
JO: But, Doctor, don't you understand? I've got to go! This Professor
Jones, he's fighting for everything that's important, everything that
you've fought for. In a funny way, he reminds me of a sort of younger
you. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know whether to feel flattered or insulted. It's all
right, Jo, I understand. <br>
JO: Oh, Doctor! Thank you. <br>

spoke to somebody who said her name was Mum. <br>

JO: Pardon? <br>
JONES: It's a sort of cousin of the mushroom you can buy in the shops. <br>
JO: You mean you can eat it? <br>
JONES: Oh yes, that's the whole point. Well, the world's going to need
something instead of meat. High protein fungus can be just the answer. <br>
JO: Well, yes. Yes, of course! <br>
JONES: You see, Jo, we haven't set up this community just to drop out.
I mean, let's face it, who does like the petrol stinking, plastic
rat-trap life we all live? No, no. If we're going to make a success
here at Wholeweal, we've got to do something that's going to help the
entire world. So we're a biotechnic research unit as well as a
Nuthutch. <br>

large wings approaches in the blue gloom and the Doctor ducks out of

ringing.) <br>
BRIGADIER: (into phone) I see. All right, keep trying and ring me here
as soon as you do get an answer, understood? Yes. Right, goodbye.
Mister Stevens, I wonder if you'd explain to me exactly why Professor
Jones and his friends should object to your new process? <br>
STEVENS: I wish I could tell you. After all, he and the rest of the
doom merchants never stop telling us that we're using up the world's
supply of oil. We can now produce twenty five percent more petrol and
diesel fuel from a given quantity of crude oil. If that isn't
conservation, I don't know what is.

doubling the atmospheric pollution. No, the world has got to find ways
of using the energy the sun is giving us now. <br>

rivers. Well, I mean, like here at the Nuthutch. Well, you are quite
warm? <br>
JO: The ambient temperature suits me fine, thank you. <br>

somewhat difficult to believe. <br>

JONES: Oh, I wish I had. No, no, it tastes fine, looks good, the
texture's right, but it's relatively low in protein. Has to be picked
at exactly the right moment, and it has to be eaten or dried straight
away, or it goes off. <br>

away on her tin whistle. She's one of the finest mathematicians in the
country. She's doing a study of the probability factors in a projected
future ecology. <br>
BRIGADIER: Is she indeed. I never would have guessed. And the gentlemen

practically unexplored territory, see? <br>

JONES: No, no, I mean the things people eat to get their protein.
Grubs, caterpillars, locusts, the blood of their cattle. <br>
JO: Urgh. <br>
JONES: Well, it's only the same as black pudding, love. <br>
JO: Oh, that's disgusting. <br>
JONES: Ah, now listen to this. (reads) And when game is in short
supply, these tribes, or so it is said, will subsist for months at a
time on a certain giant toadstool peculiar to their region, which
serves them for their meat. Thus doth beneficent providence etc, etc. <br>
BRIGADIER: When was that published? <br>
JONES: 1884. <br>
BRIGADIER: And on the strength of that, you'll go gallivanting off into
the jungle? <br>
JONES: Aye. <br>
JO: But of course, Well look, it's like finding an old treasure map,

BRIGADIER: Right, Benton, now we know how to deal with these creatures,
the next thing is to get the National Coal Board to open up that

YATES: That's just it, Doctor, I don't know. But whatever it is, it's
pretty big and it's going to happen at four o'clock. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I'll get up there as soon as I finish this. <br>
NANCY: What is it you're doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Making an aqueous extract of the amino fraction of this fungus.
<br>
NANCY: For an injection? <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. <br>
NANCY: I can do that. I'm not just a mum here, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nancy. Jo, make up the paste from that fungus powder
and apply it to the green stain on Cliff's neck. <br>
JO: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, Captain Yates, where's the Brigadier? <br>
YATES: He's gone to Global Chemicals. Hopes to confront the Director
and get him to talk.

also a fool. As Oscar Wilde so very nearly said, to lose one prisoner
may be accounted a misfortune, to lose two smacks of carelessness. <br>

seven other complexes throughout the world. Think of that. You have
failed in your poor little attempt to halt our progress towards maximum

yours leads. Wholesale pollution of the countryside. Devilish creatures
spawned by the filthy by-products of your technology. Men walking
around like brainless vegetables. Death. Disease. Destruction. <br>
