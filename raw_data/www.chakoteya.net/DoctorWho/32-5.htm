Michael's Mount, but a bit flatter and further from any shoreline.) <br>
JIMMY: Lights. <br>
(The lights come on and the two men and a woman walk forward. They are
wearing protective clothing.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JIMMY: Lights. You know the drill, people. Plastic
visors down and locked. Buzzer? <br>
(Buzzer raises the lid on a large vat.) <br>
JENNIFER: Reading of nine point seven. <br>
JIMMY: Sounds a bit low for unrefined. How's the average? <br>
JENNIFER: The acid potency stats have definitely dropped below the mean
during the last quarter. <br>
BUZZER: Prettier than a computer, isn't she? <br>
JENNIFER: Give over, Buzz. <br>
(Buzzer is standing on the edge of the vat when she gives him a nudge.
He falls in.) <br>
JENNIFER: Buzzer. Buzz. <br>
JIMMY: Oh, great. Nice going, twinkle toes. <br>
JENNIFER: I shouldn't have swung at him. Sorry, Buzz. My bad. <br>
BUZZER: No, you're all right. Jimmy? <br>
JIMMY: Well, no point carrying you back legless. Sorry, Buzzer. You're
dead. <br>
BUZZER: Well, this is a right pain in the armour. Heart's gone now. <br>
JIMMY: Look, we'd best get off. Got to write this one up for the boss.
Those suits cost a bomb. If I miss my boy's birthday filling out forms,
I'll kill you again. <br>
(Buzzer raises a farewell hand, which melts. Jennifer and Jimmy leave.)
<br>
JIMMY: Lights.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JENNIFER: I'm looking at these readings, Jimmy, and
the potency stats are way too low. We may have to take that read again.
This thing is still jamming up on me. <br>
BUZZER: So I think we'd better talk about what just happened back
there. I could get compensation. I've seen the holo-ads. Had an
accident in the workplace? Yeah, I have as it goes. I melted. <br>
JIMMY: Let it go. <br>
BUZZER: Just remember. When you're doing your report, it wasn't my
fault. She took a swing at me. <br>
JENNIFER: I never touched you. You've got two left feet, Buzzer. <br>
BUZZER: I haven't got two left feet. Or any arms, neck, head, the chin.
This body costs money, love. <br>
JIMMY: Not as much as that acid suit. <br>
BUZZER: Oh, lighten up. It's not like anyone was hurt. <br>
(The version of Buzzer in the acid vat finally dissolves.)

told it is called Supermassive Black Hole by Muse. Whatever. Rory and
Amy are playing darts.) <br>
AMY: Forty six. Rubbishy, rubbishy, rubbish. <br>
RORY: Hello? It's a double top. <br>
AMY: Wrong side of the wire, mister. <br>
RORY: You're on the oche, Red. <br>
(The scanner still cannot decide whether Amy is pregnant or not. The
Doctor turns off the music.) <br>
DOCTOR: Who wants fish and chips? <br>
(Rory raises his hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'll drop you both off. Take your time. Don't rush. <br>
RORY: Er, and you? Things to do. Things involving other things. <br>
AMY: Well, we'll stay with you. We'll do the other things. <br>
DOCTOR: Nope. <br>
AMY: Whatever you're up to, I'd personally like to be a part of it.
What? <br>
(A klaxon blares, then everyone gets thrown around.) <br>
DOCTOR: Solar tsunami. Came directly from your sun. A tidal wave of
radiation. Big, big, big. <br>
RORY: Oh Doctor, my tummy's going funny. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the gyrator disconnected. Target tracking is out. <br>
(The Tardis heads for Earth.) <br>
DOCTOR: Assume the position! <br>

still.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Behold, a cockerel! Love a cockerel. <br>
(A weathervane.) <br>
DOCTOR: And underneath, a monastery. Thirteenth century. <br>
AMY: Oh, we've gone all mediaeval. <br>
RORY: I'm not sure about that. <br>
AMY: Really? Mediaeval expert are you? <br>
RORY: No, it's just that I can hear Dusty Springfield. <br>
(You Don't Have To Say You Love Me. The Doctor inspects a hole in the
ground with a pipe running through it. The pipe is labelled Danger
Corrosive.) <br>
DOCTOR: These fissures are new. Solar tsunami sent out a huge wave of
gamma particles. This is caused by a magnetic quake that occurs just
before the wave hits. <br>
AMY: Well, the monastery's standing. <br>
(The Doctor takes a snow globe out of his pocket and shakes it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, for now. <br>
RORY: Doctor, look. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. It's a supply pipe. Ceramic inner lining. Something
corrosive. They're pumping something nasty off this island to the
mainland. <br>
RORY: My mum's a massive fan of Dusty Springfield. <br>
DOCTOR: Who isn't? Right, let's go. Satisfy our rabid curiosity.
</font></p>

monks, then? <br>
DOCTOR: I think we're here. This is it. <br>
RORY: Doctor, what are you talking about? We've never been here before.
<br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
AMY: We came here by accident? <br>
DOCTOR: Accident? Yes, I know. Accident. <br>
RORY: Ow! <br>
DOCTOR: Acid. They're pumping acid off this island. That's old stuff.
Fresh acid, you wouldn't have a finger. <br>
TANNOY: Intruder alert. Intruder alert. <br>
DOCTOR: There are people coming. Well, almost. <br>
AMY: Almost coming? <br>
DOCTOR: Almost people. <br>
RORY: I think we should really be going. <br>
AMY: Come on! <br>
RORY: I'm telling you. When something runs towards you, it is never for
a nice reason.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Harness room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Buzzer and others are reclining in harnesses in
the alcoves.) <br>
AMY: What are all these harnesses for? <br>
RORY: The almost people? <br>
AMY: What are they, prisoners, or are they meditating, or what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, at the moment they fall into the or what category. <br>
TANNOY: Halt and remain calm. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we've halted. How are we all doing on the calm front? <br>
JIMMY: Don't move! <br>
BUZZER: Stay back, Jen. We don't know who they are. <br>
JENNIFER: So let's ask them. Who the hell are you? <br>
(Amy looks around at the same people in the harnesses.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm the Doctor, and this is Amy and Rory, and it's all
very nice, isn't it? <br>
AMY: Hold up. You're all. What are you all? Like identical twins? <br>
(Two more people walk in wearing acid suits. The woman seems to be in
charge.) <br>
CLEAVES: This is an Alpha Grade industrial facility. Unless you work
for the military or for Morpeth Jetson, you are in big trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: Actually, you're in big trouble. <br>
(He gets out the psychic paper.) <br>
CLEAVES: Meteorological Department? Since when? <br>
DOCTOR: Since you were hit by a solar wave. <br>
CLEAVES: Which we survived. <br>
DOCTOR: Just, by the look of it. And there's a bigger one on the way. <br>
CLEAVES: Which we'll also survive. Dicken, scan for bugs. <br>
BUZZER: Backs against the wall. Now. <br>
DOCTOR: You're not a monastery, you're a factory. Twenty second century
army-owned factory. <br>
AMY: You're army? <br>
CLEAVES: No, love. We're contractors, and you're trespassers. <br>
DICKEN: It's clear, boss. <br>
CLEAVES: All right, weatherman, your ID checks out. If there's another
solar storm, what are you going to do about it? Hand out sunblock? <br>
DOCTOR: I need to see your critical systems. <br>
CLEAVES: Which one? <br>
DOCTOR: You know which one.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Flesh room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Another vat, this time filled with bubbling milky
liquid.) <br>
DOCTOR: And there you are. <br>
CLEAVES: Meet the government's worst kept secret. The Flesh. It's fully
programmable matter. In fact, it's even learning to replicate itself at
the cellular level. <br>
AMY: Right. Brilliant. Lost. <br>
CLEAVES: Okay. Once a reading's been taken, we can manipulate its
molecular structure into anything. Replicate a living organism down to
the hairs on its chinny chin chin. Even clothes. And everything's
identical. Eyes, voice <br>
DOCTOR: Mind, soul? <br>
CLEAVES: Don't be fooled, Doctor. It acts like life but it still needs
to be controlled by us, from those harnesses you saw. <br>
RORY: Wait, whoa. Hold it. So, you're Flesh now? <br>
CLEAVES: I'm lying in a harness back in that chamber. We all are,
except Jennifer here. Don't be scared. This thing, just like operating
a forklift truck. <br>
DOCTOR: You said it could grow. Only living things grow. <br>
CLEAVES: Moss grows. It's no more than that. This acid is so dangerous
we were losing a worker every week. So now we mine the acid using these
doppelgangers. Or Gangers. If these bodies get burnt or fall in the
acid <br>
BUZZER: Then who the hell cares, right, Jen? <br>
JENNIFER: Nerve endings automatically cut off like airbags being
discharged. We wake up and get a new Ganger. <br>
JIMMY: It's weird, but you get used to it. <br>
CLEAVES: Jennifer, I want you in your Ganger. Get back to the harness. <br>
(Jennifer leaves. The Doctor scans the Flesh.) <br>
BUZZER: Hang on, what's he up to? What you up to, pal? <br>
DOCTOR: Stop it. Strange. It was like for a moment there it was
scanning me. <br>
CLEAVES: Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor's hand is pulled to the surface of the Flesh.) <br>
CLEAVES: Get back, Doctor. Leave it alone. <br>
(He finally yanks his hand back.) <br>
DOCTOR: I understand. <br>
AMY: Doctor? Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Incredible. You have no idea. No idea. I mean, I felt it in my
mind. I reached out to it, and it to me. <br>
CLEAVES: Don't fiddle with the money, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: How can you be so blinkered? It's alive. So alive. You're
piling your lives, your personalities directly into it. <br>
(Bang, flash.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's the solar storm. The first waves come in pairs. Pre-shock
and fore-shock. It's close. <br>
CLEAVES: Buzzer, we got anything from the mainland yet? <br>
BUZZER: No, the comms are still too jammed with radiation. <br>
CLEAVES: Okay. Then we'll keep pumping acid until the mainland says
stop. Now why don't you stand back and let us impress you?

appears in it and a few moments later a new Jennifer sits up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can see why you keep it in a church. Miracle of life. <br>
BUZZER: No need to get poncey. It's just gunge. <br>
CLEAVES: Guys, we need to get to work. <br>
JIMMY: Okay, everybody, let's crack on. <br>
DOCTOR: Did I mention the solar storm? You need to get out of here. <br>
JIMMY: Where do you want us to go? We're on a tiny island. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can get you all off it. <br>
CLEAVES: Don't be ridiculous. We've got a job to do. <br>
DOCTOR: It's coming. <br>
JENNIFER: That's the alarm. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you get power? <br>
CLEAVES: We're solar. We use a solar router. The weathervane. <br>
DOCTOR: Big problem. <br>
JIMMY: Boss, maybe if the storm's back we should get underground. The
factory's seen better days. The acid pipes might not withstand another
hit. <br>
CLEAVES: We have two hundred tons of acid to pump out. We fall behind,
we stay another rotation. Anyone want that? <br>
DOCTOR: Please, you are making a massive mistake here. You're right at
the crossroads of it. Don't turn the wrong way. If you don't, if you
don't prepare for this storm, you are all in terrible danger.
Understand? <br>
CLEAVES: My factory, my rules. <br>
DOCTOR: I need to check the progress of the storm. Monitoring station?
Monitoring station. <br>
JENNIFER: Three lefts, a right and a left. Third door on your left. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A big storm lights up the sky.) <br>
DOCTOR: Waves disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. There is going to
be the mother and father of all power surges. See this weathervane, the
cock-a-doodle-do? It's a solar router feeding the whole factory with
solar power. When that wave hits,
ka-boom. I've to get to that cockerel before all hell breaks loose. I
never thought I'd have to say that again. Amy, breathe. <br>
AMY: Yeah! I mean, thanks. I'll try. <br>
(The Doctor heads up the spiral staircase to the tower top. The
weathervane is spinning very fast. <br>
Down in the harness room, the Gangers are watching their originals as
the storm gathers force. <br>
Down in the crypt and outside, pipes burst and acid leaks out. The
ground below the Tardis dissolves, and it sinks. <br>
Up in the air, the Doctor opens the Danger High Voltage box and starts
pulling relays. There is a strike and he is thrown off the ladder. <br>
Electricity blasts down into the Flesh vat. All the Gangers faces
become slightly molten, and they cry out. <br>
After a short time, the Doctor wakes. The weathervane has been
destroyed. The monastery goes dark.) </font></p>

CLEAVES: Not long. A minute, two minutes? <br>
DOCTOR: I'd hazard we've been out a teensy bit longer. <br>
CLEAVES: Well, how long? <br>

JIMMY: It feels like the National Grid's run through my bones but apart
from that <br>
BUZZER: I hope the meter's not bust. I still want to get paid. <br>
RORY: Jennifer! Jennifer. Hey, all right? <br>
JENNIFER: It hurt so much. <br>

RORY: Welcome to my world. <br>

AMY: Doctor, these are all real people, so where are their Gangers? <br>
CLEAVES: Don't worry. When the link shuts down the Gangers return to
pure Flesh. Now, the storm's left us with acid leaks all over, so we
need to contact the mainland. They can have a rescue shuttle out here
in no time. <br>
(The Dusty Springfield song starts up.) <br>
JIMMY: That's my record. Who's playing my record? <br>
DOCTOR: Your Gangers. They've gone walkabout. <br>
CLEAVES: No, it's impossible. They're not active. Cars don't fly
themselves, cranes don't lift themselves and Gangers don't

BUZZER: This is just like the Isle of Sheppey. <br>

CLEAVES: They've ransacked everything. <br>
DOCTOR: Not ransacked, searched. <br>
CLEAVES: Through our stuff! <br>
DOCTOR: Their stuff. <br>
JIMMY: Searching for what? <br>
DOCTOR: Confirmation. They need to know their memories are real. <br>
BUZZER: Oh, so they've got flaming memories now. <br>
DOCTOR: They feel compelled to connect to their lives. <br>
CLEAVES: Their stolen lives. <br>
DOCTOR: No, bequeathed. You gave them this. You poured in your
personalities, emotions, traits, memories, secrets, everything. You
gave them your lives. Human lives are amazing. Are you surprised they
walked off with them? <br>
BUZZER: I'll say it again. Isle of Sheppey. Ganger got an electric
shock, toddled off, killed his operator right there in his harness.
I've seen the photos. This bloke's ear was all hanging <br>
JIMMY: Even if this has actually happened, they can't remain stable
without us plumbed in to them, can they, boss. <br>
CLEAVES: Guess we'll find out. <br>
RORY: Are you okay? Do you need some water? <br>
JENNIFER: I feel funny. I need the washroom. <br>

BUZZER: That's me. It's good to have a hobby. So what, my Ganger did
that all on its own? <br>
DOCTOR: Who taught you to do this? <br>
BUZZER: My granddad. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, your Ganger's granddad taught him to do it, too. You both
have the same childhood memories, just as clear, just as real. <br>

We er, we'd better get going. Everything okay in there, Jen? <br>

out on a stretchy neck.) <br>

Amy, when you got to the alcoves, who was in harness? <br>

Jimmy holds him back.) <br>

her? <br>
DOCTOR: That's it. Good, you remember. This is early Flesh. The early
stages of the technology. So much to learn. <br>
AMY: Doctor, what's happened to her? <br>
DOCTOR: She can't stabilise. She's shifting between half-formed and

JIMMY: Keep going straight. Can't miss it. But you're never going to
get your vehicle in here. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm a great parker. <br>
JIMMY: We really need those acid suits. I've sent Buzzer and Dicken to
get them. <br>
AMY: Fine and dandy. I'm just going to find my husband, so cheers. <br>
JIMMY: Amy, I wouldn't. <br>
AMY: Nor would I. What can you do, eh? <br>
JIMMY: At least wait for an acid suit.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Rory finds Jennifer.) <br>
G-JENNIFER: When I was a little girl, I got lost on the moors, wandered
off from the picnic. I can still feel how sore my toes got inside my
red welly boots. And I imagined another little girl, just like me, in
red wellies, and she was Jennifer too. Except she was a strong
Jennifer, a tough Jennifer. She'd lead me home. My name is Jennifer
Lucas. I am not a factory part. I had toast for my breakfast. I wrote a
letter to my mum. And then you arrived. I noticed your eyes right off. <br>
RORY: Did you? <br>
G-JENNIFER: Nice eyes. Kind. <br>
RORY: Where is the real Jennifer? <br>
G-JENNIFER: I am Jennifer Lucas. I remember everything that happened in
her entire life. Every birthday, every childhood illness. I feel
everything she has ever felt and more. I'm not a monster! I am me. Me!
Me! Me! <br>
(She looks completely human now.) <br>
G-JENNIFER: Why did they do this to us? Help me, Rory. Help me. <br>
RORY: Shush, shush. </font></p>

runs back into the monastery.)

BUZZER: Those damn Gangers got to the acid suits. <br>
DICKEN: There is acid leaking everywhere. Did you see the boss' eyes
back there in the hall? <br>

G-CLEAVES: Why don't you tell us? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we have two choices. The first is to tear each other
apart. Not my favourite. The second is to knuckle down and work
together. Try to work out how best we can help you. </font></p>

G-JIMMY: You're telling me. <br>
G-CLEAVES: All right, Doctor, you've brought us together. Now what? <br>
DOCTOR: Before we do anything, I have one very important question. Has
anybody got a pair of shoes I could borrow? Size ten. Although I should
warn you, I have very wide feet.

DOCTOR: The Flesh was never merely moss. These are not copies. The
storm has hardwired them. They are becoming people. <br>
JIMMY: With souls? <br>
DICKEN: Rubbish! Achoo. <br>
DOCTOR: Bless you. We were all jelly once. Little jelly eggs sitting in
goop. <br>
AMY: Yeah, thanks. Too much information. <br>
DOCTOR: We are not talking about an accident that needs to be mopped
up. We are talking about sacred life. Do you understand? Good. Now, the
Tardis is trapped in an acid pool. Once I can reach her, I can get you
all off this island, humans and Gangers, eh? How does that sound? <br>
JIMMY: Can I make it home for Adam's birthday? <br>
G-JIMMY: What about me? He's my son too. <br>
JIMMY: You? You really think that? <br>
G-JIMMY: I feel it. <br>
JIMMY: Oh, so you were there when he was born, were you? <br>
G-JIMMY: Yeah. I drank about eight pints of tea, then they told me I
had a wee boy and I just burst out laughing. No idea why. I miss home,
as much as you. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not going to lie to you. It's a right old mess, this.
But as you might say up North, oh well, I'll just go to't foot of
stairs. Eee by by gum. Or not. Good. Right. First step is we get
everyone together, then get everyone safe. Then, get everyone out of
here. <br>
AMY: But we're still missing Jennifer and Cleaves. <br>
JIMMY: I'll go and look for them. <br>
G-JIMMY: I'll give you a hand, if you like. Cover more ground. <br>
JIMMY: Yeah, okay. Thanks. <br>
CLEAVES: This circus has gone on long enough. <br>
G-CLEAVES: Oh, great. You see, that is just so typically me. <br>
CLEAVES: Doctor, tell it to shut up! <br>
DOCTOR: Cleaves, no. No, no. <br>
CLEAVES: Circuit probe. Fires about ooo, forty thousand volts? Would
kill any one of us, so I guess she'll work on Gangers just the same. <br>
DOCTOR: It's interesting you refer to them as it, but you call a
glorified cattle prod a she. <br>
CLEAVES: When the real people are safely off this island, then I'll
happily talk philosophy over a pint with you, Doctor. <br>
AMY: What are you going to do to them? <br>
CLEAVES: Sorry. They're monsters. Mistakes. They have to be destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: Give me the probe, Cleaves. <br>
CLEAVES: We always have to take charge, don't we, Miranda. Even when we
don't really know what the hell is going on. <br>
(Ganger Buzzer tries to rush her. Cleaves zaps him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Argh! He's dead! <br>
CLEAVES: We call it decommissioned. <br>
DOCTOR: You stopped his heart. He had a heart. Aorta, valves, a real
human heart. And you stopped it. <br>
RORY: Jen? <br>
G-JENNIFER: What happened to Buzzer will happen to all of us if we
trust you. <br>
DOCTOR: Wait, wait, just wait. <br>
RORY: No! <br>

Gangers run away.) <br>

you? It's us and them now. Us and them. <br>
