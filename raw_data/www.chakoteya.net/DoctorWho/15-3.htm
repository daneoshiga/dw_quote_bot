<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Earth, now. We are in a geology lab, with maps on
the wall, row of test tubes, rock samples, filing cabinets and sets of
drawers. An old skull, without its mandible, sits on a stand.) <br>
COLBY: Oh, don't just sit there, Eustace, say something. <br>
THEA: Why don't you just publish and get it over with. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893243/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Wanda
Ventham</a>.) <br>
COLBY: Why should anyone believe it? I found him and I don't. <br>
THEA: Are you questioning my technical competence. <br>
COLBY: Of course not. The volcanic sediment is twelve million years
old. I accept without reservation the results of your excellent
potassium-argon test. <br>
THEA: Thank you. <br>
COLBY: What I don't accept is that Eustace here got himself buried
under a volcano at least eight million years before he could have
possibly existed. <br>
(Another white-coated scientist enters.) <br>
STAEL: Colby, Doctor Fendelman is waiting for the corrected
coordinates. <br>
COLBY: Here you go. <br>
STAEL: Thank you. <br>
COLBY: Oh, and Maxi, end the day with a smile. <br>
(Maximilian Stael leaves. Colby winks at Thea. <br>
Outside, in the dark, n owl hoots nearby as an unshaven man with a
rucksack makes his way through the trees. He comes upon a patch of
misty ground and begins whistling the theme to The Sting, I think. A
ragtime tune, anyway.) </font></p>

is a far more sophisticated laboratory, with a bank of computers whose
lights are blinking in unison, banks of monitors and a control console.
Stael hands its occupant the clipboard with the corrected coordinates
on it. This is an older man with a possibly South American accent. Say
Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0510317/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Denis
Lill</a>.) <br>
FENDELMAN: Yes. Good, good. Right. Stael, we can begin. <br>
(The two men sit at opposite banks of equipment.) <br>
FENDELMAN: Phase one power. <br>
STAEL: Phase one power. <br>
FENDELMAN: Phase two power. <br>
STAEL: Phase two power. <br>
(In the geology lab, the top of Eustace's skull begins to glow. Thea,
who is on her own, goes to look at it.) <br>
FENDELMAN: Switching to main computer control. <br>
(Readouts appear on two monitors.) <br>
FENDELMAN: Activate full power run-up sequence. <br>
STAEL: Activating full power run-up sequence, now. <br>

the skull keeps glowing and its image starts to merge with Thea's face.

something. He drops his rucksack so he can go quicker, but he is
tiring.) <br>
MAN: I can't, I can't. <br>

puts her hands to her head and gently falls sideways.) </font></p>

pinned up and is wearing a light brown version of her leather costume.)
<br>
LEELA: Professor Marius would not be very pleased. <br>
(The Doctor has K9 open and lots of wires strewn across the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nasty. Very nasty. <br>
LEELA: Will he be all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. I don't know. It will be all right. It just has a little
corrosion in its circuits. <br>
LEELA: I can call K9 he if I want to. You call the Tardis she. <br>
DOCTOR: Never. <br>
LEELA: Never. You do. I've heard you. You called it she just a moment
ago. And another thing. It is quite clear to me that you cannot control
this old machine either. <br>
DOCTOR: What did you say, Leela? <br>
LEELA: Leela said <br>
DOCTOR: I heard what you said. <br>
LEELA: Then why ask? <br>
DOCTOR: Leela, I understand the Tardis perfectly. There's not one
single part of her that I haven't adjusted or repaired at some time or
another. <br>
LEELA: Don't cry about it. <br>
DOCTOR: Furthermore, I am in complete and constant control of her. <br>
(They get thrown sideways.) <br>
LEELA: Complete and constant? What is it? What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Someone's using a sonic time scan. Come on, old girl. Don't let
us down now. Come on. <br>
LEELA: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: We're being dragged towards a relative continuum displacement
zone. <br>
LEELA: A what? <br>
DOCTOR: A relative continuum displacement. It's like a hole in time. <br>
LEELA: What will happen? <br>
DOCTOR: I wish I knew. <br>
LEELA: Can we get free? <br>
DOCTOR: That depends on this misunderstood, unmanageable old machine. <br>
LEELA: I meant no disrespect. <br>
DOCTOR: She's turning. <br>
LEELA: I could have been mistaken. <br>
DOCTOR: She's done it. Well done, old girl. You're wonderful.
Wonderful. She's wonderful. Isn't she wonderful? Tardis wonderful! <br>
LEELA: Doctor, you did not tell me. Can she really understand what we
say? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, she just generates a low intensity telepathic
field, and obviously primitive thought patterns like yours appeal to
her. <br>
LEELA: They do? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: Oh. Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: That's odd. <br>
LEELA: What, my thought patterns? <br>
DOCTOR: What? No, no, no. I can't calculate the coordinates. <br>
LEELA: What are we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: We'll just have to trace the scan back to its source. <br>
LEELA: To destroy it? <br>
DOCTOR: We have to stop it being used, certainly, otherwise it'll cause
a direct continuum implosion and destroy the planet it's operating
from. <br>
LEELA: Well, do we know which one that is yet? <br>
DOCTOR: It can't be. Oh, no. <br>
LEELA: What? What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Not that one. <br>
LEELA: What one? <br>
DOCTOR: Not there. <br>
LEELA: Not where? <br>
DOCTOR: Earth. <br>
LEELA: Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Your ancestors have a talent for self-destruction that
borders on genius. <br>
LEELA: Listen, Doctor, I do not like the way you keep talking about my
ancestors. <br>
DOCTOR: I like your new dress. <br>
LEELA: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a pleasure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Next morning, Thea is sitting at a big table in a
flag-stoned old kitchen, reading the newspaper. Fendelman enters.) <br>
FENDELMAN: Ah, Thea. You are feeling better this morning? <br>
THEA: Yes, I'm fine, thanks, Doctor Fendelman. I still don't remember
what happened, though. But I do remember it was your turn to make
breakfast this morning, Max. <br>
FENDELMAN: Ah yes. I'm afraid that was my fault. We have been working
all night, haven't we, Max. We have only just finished. And the
results, I think the results will amaze even Colby. Where is he, by the
way? <br>
THEA: He's out, exercising Leaky. </font></p>

COLBY: Leaky! Here, boy! Leaky, come on. Leaky, now what have you got
there? More bones, is it, you old bone hunter you. <br>
(It is the body of the man from last night. Church bells ring out in
the distance. It must be Sunday.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Kitchen]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FENDELMAN: But Colby's methodology cannot be
faulted. The excavation of the skull was brilliant. The reconstruction
was first class work. <br>
THEA: But he cannot accept the evolutionary implications. <br>
FENDELMAN: And you, Thea? Can you accept them? <br>
THEA: Chronology is my field, Doctor Fendelman. I'm a technician, not a
human palaeontologist. <br>
(Colby rushes in.) <br>
COLBY: There's a corpse by the wood. <br>
FENDELMAN: What sort of corpse? <br>
COLBY: A dead one. What other sort is there? <br>
FENDELMAN: Male or female? <br>
COLBY: Oh, male. <br>
THEA: Do we know him? <br>
COLBY: I never saw him before. <br>
FENDELMAN: How did he die? Are there signs of violence? <br>
COLBY: Well, not exactly. By the look of him, he didn't die easily. <br>
STAEL: It is never easy to die. <br>
COLBY: Well, thank you, Max. I'm going to call the police. <br>
FENDELMAN: No, a moment, a moment. No, we must consider. <br>
COLBY: What's to consider? There's a body out there. We can't just
leave it. Or are you breeding vultures in that secret lab of yours,
hmm? <br>
FENDELMAN: This is no time for discourtesy, Adam. <br>
COLBY: I'm sorry. It was a shock. He looks terrible. He must have been
terrified when he died. <br>
FENDELMAN: Adam, Adam, just think for a moment. These woods, they are
supposed to be haunted. Now can you imagine what would happen if there
were news of a mysterious death in them? <br>
THEA: Well, there'd be a certain amount of publicity. <br>
FENDELMAN: Publicity? It would be a circus. They attract enough
lunatics already without advertising for them. <br>
COLBY: I don't see that we've much alternative. <br>
FENDELMAN: Adam, Adam. Our work is at a critical stage. Your discovery
could be one of the most important milestones in human development.
Your work will fundamentally affect how man views himself. We cannot be
interrupted at this moment of destiny. <br>
COLBY: Yes, but <br>
FENDELMAN: And besides, we wouldn't want your Nobel Prize to be
jeopardised by an unfortunate coincidence, now would we? <br>
THEA: What are you suggesting? <br>
FENDELMAN: I'm not suggesting anything. Adam will recover and then he
can show us the body. Then we will decide, eh? We could arrange for it
to be found somewhere else. <br>
THEA: But that's illegal! <br>
FENDELMAN: A small deception only. <br>
THEA: Adam, you can't possibly <br>
COLBY: It wouldn't make much difference. <br>
FENDELMAN: There, you see? We work something out, eh? Stael. (sotto)
Get on to London. Tell Hartman I want a security team here within two
hours. Tell him I want the best men we have and I want them armed. Then
I shall want you to do a post- mortem on that body. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Earth. <br>
LEELA: Is this the place of the sonic time scan? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Oh, well, more or less. I haven't pinpointed it
definitely, but it's certain to be around here somewhere. <br>

more. You know, I don't think these cows know anything about the time

representation of this area here, then we shall see the living owner of
that skull. <br>
STAEL: I have completed the post-mortem. <br>
FENDELMAN: And? <br>
STAEL: I cannot find the exact cause of death. There is a small blister
at the base of his skull, but that can't have killed him. <br>
FENDELMAN: Natural causes, then. <br>
STAEL: There is something strange. <br>
FENDELMAN: Oh, what's that? <br>
STAEL: The outward signs are that the man died quite recently. His
watch is still working, he has a Thermos of tea in his pocket which is
still hot, yesterday's newspaper. The mud on his boots is still <br>
FENDELMAN: Yes, yes, yes, Stael, get on with it. <br>
STAEL: The body is decomposing. <br>
FENDELMAN: Already? <br>
STAEL: It's falling apart as you watch. <br>
FENDELMAN: The cause? <br>
STAEL: I don't know, but it's as though all the energy has been
removed. All the binding force has gone and all that remains is a husk.

LEELA: He came armed and silent. <br>

LEELA: Your Council should choose its warriors more carefully. A child
of the Sevateem could have taken you. <br>
MOSS: Escaped from somewhere, hasn't she? If you're her doctor, you
shouldn't let her wander around loose. She could do someone a damage. <br>
LEELA: He was not hunting us? <br>

say he's one of the richest men in the world. You wouldn't think so to
look at him, scruffy devil. They say he made his money out of
electronics, but that don't seem likely 'cos he ain't Japanese. <br>

on Earth, of this I am sure. There is something else that I have not
told you. With the scanner, I have traced what I now believe to be the
moment of death of this alien traveller. At that moment, there is an
enormous surge of power the like of which I have not seen before. It
was this that first attracted my attention. It is an inpouring of
energy. A concentration of power as though to store. Now I ask myself,
where would this power be stored? And why? These questions I could not
answer until I had x-rayed the skull. <br>

assembled. <br>
(Fendelman takes it from the light box.) <br>
FENDELMAN: No. It is part of the bone structure itself. I believe it to
be a form of neural relay, and this is where the energy is stored. It
is interesting, is it not, that for as long as man can remember, the
pentagram has been a symbol for mystical energy and power. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. So you've lived in this cottage all your life, haven't
you, Mrs Tyler. <br>
MARTHA: Why should I tell 'ee ought? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, telepathy and precognition are normal in anyone whose
childhood was spent near a time fissure, like the one in the wood. <br>
TYLER: He's as bad as she is. Here, what's a time fissure? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a weakness in the fabric of space and time. Every haunted
place has one, doesn't it? That's why they're haunted. It's a time
distortion. This one must be very large. Large enough to have affected
the place names round here. Like Fetchborough. Fetch. An apparition,
hmm? <br>
MARTHA: How do 'ee know so much? <br>
DOCTOR: I read a lot. What did you see in the wood, Mrs Tyler? <br>
MARTHA: I didn't see ought with my eyes. <br>

evolved on Earth. <br>
LEELA: How did it travel? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: Well, you said there's only one. It could not build a

DOCTOR: That impression's produced by a time loop. <br>

LEELA: Time loop? <br>

circle of time, making data and its records invisible. Only a Time Lord
could do that. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Fendelman's lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> COLBY: So when the Time Lords acted, it was too
late. The Fendahl had already come here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, probably taking in Mars on it's way through. <br>
COLBY: Then it got itself buried, but not killed. <br>
DOCTOR: The Fendahl is death. How do you kill death? No, what happened
was this. The energy amassed by the Fendahl was stored in the skull and
dissipated slowly as a biological transmutation field. Now, any
appropriate lifeform that came within the field was altered so that it
ultimately evolved into something suitable for the Fendahl to use. <br>
COLBY: Are you saying that skull created man? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm saying it may have effected his evolution. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TYLER: I can't hear nothing. <br>
LEELA: Shush. There's something coming this way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Fendelman's lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: That would explain the dark side of man's
nature. But it's just a theory. <br>
COLBY: A pretty wild one. <br>
DOCTOR: It's more fun that way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LEELA: Now, Jack, as soon as you see it, fire, and
we shall run. <br>
TYLER: Look! <br>
(The golden woman appears in the corridor, with a giant Fendahleen
behind her.) <br>
LEELA: Don't look at her, Jack! Fire the gun! <br>
TYLER: I can't. <br>
LEELA: Don't look at her! <br>
TYLER: I can't. <br>
LEELA: Jack, give me the gun. <br>
TYLER: I can't. <br>
(Leela karate chops the back of Tyler's neck, and he falls. Leela tries
to aim the shotgun without looking at her target.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Fendelman's lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Almost there. Oh, if you want an
alternative explanation, the Fendahl fed into the RNA of certain
individuals the instincts and compulsions necessary to recreate. These
were fed through the generations till they reached Fendelman and people
like him. <br>
COLBY: Well, that's possibly more plausible. <br>
DOCTOR: Or on the other hand, it could all be just a coincidence.
Finished. <br>
(A shotgun fires.) <br>
DOCTOR: Find Mrs Tyler. Give her a hand with the salt. Time's running
out. <br>
(The golden woman returns to the pentagram in the chapel.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Leela! Leela! <br>
(Tyler, Leela and a dead Fendahleen lie on the floor.) <br>
LEELA: What happened? Did I hit it? <br>
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you did. You're quite right, Leela. Good marksmanship
isn't a matter of luck. Come on. <br>
(The golden woman transforms herself into a Fendahleen.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Fendelman's lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Martha pushes in a trolley loaded with a wicker
basket and nine or so bottles.) <br>
MARTHA: Here you are. That's all the salt I can lay me hands on. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Right, battle stations. Jack, you and your grandma, back
to the cottage. <br>
TYLER: Right, we'll get <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. You know what to do. <br>
TYLER: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: Good man. <br>
(Martha and Tyler leave as Colby enters.) <br>
COLBY: Oh, where are you going? <br>
TYLER: We're going back to the cottage. <br>
MARTHA: You'll catch us up. <br>
COLBY: Oh, don't worry. I'll probably overtake you. <br>
(Colby hands over a large box with a radioactivity symbol on the side.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Lead lined? <br>
COLBY: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Perfect. Right, now this is what I want you to do. Give Leela
and me time to get down to the cellar, and then switch on the scanner
beam. With luck it should confuse things down there long enough for us
to grab the skull and get away. <br>
COLBY: Well then what? <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. This is important. Be sure to operate the scanner beam
for only two minutes, then switch if off and you go. <br>
COLBY: But why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I've rigged that to set off a controlled implosion
three minutes after you switch off the scanner. We need three minutes
to get clear. <br>
COLBY: A big bang? <br>
DOCTOR: Pretty big. Big enough to blow this place to atoms. <br>
LEELA: Then why don't we leave the skull here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, too dangerous. It could pop up anywhere and start the
whole thing over again. Come on. <br>
(Leela picks up the wicker basket which she has loaded with the flasks
of salt, and kisses Colby on the cheek.) <br>
LEELA: Good luck. <br>
(Colby shuts the door after them and checks his watch. The Doctor
reenters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Psst. Remember, three minutes. <br>
(The Doctor holds up four fingers then leaves. After a short time,
Colby switches on the scanner. The count passes 9 seconds as Leela and
the Doctor arrive at the cellar door.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The place is filled with smoke. A Fendahleen
stands at the bottom of the stairs.) <br>
LEELA: Look out, Doctor! <br>
(They throw flasks at it, and miss.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, better save some for later. <br>
LEELA: Do not worry. <br>
(They get to the bottom of the stairs as the count passes one minute.
The Doctor goes to the altar and opens the radiation box, then puts on
the protective gloves. Small Fendahleen hiss at him as he puts the
skull into the box and closes it, removes the glove and leaves. One
minute fifty one and counting.) </font></p>

COLBY: You've got three minutes, Doctor. <br>

pentagram.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, I've got it. Let's get out of here. <br>
LEELA: Something's happened. <br>
DOCTOR: He's switched off the scanner beam. We've got three minutes.
Come on! <br>
(Leela throws a flask over her shoulder as they run up the stairs.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A ghostly figure blocks their way.) <br>
LEELA: Look! <br>
DOCTOR: No, don't! <br>
(The Doctor knocks the basket out of her hand, scattering salt on the
carpet. With their eyes cast downwards, they walk through the image.) <br>
LEELA [OC]: We've done it! <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Come on, run! <br>
(The ceiling starts to fall in. The golden woman returns to the
pentagram.) </font></p>

TYLER: You all right, Gran? <br>
MARTHA: Yes. <br>
TYLER: Well, keep your head down, then. Hey, somebody's coming. <br>

walls buckle inwards.) <br>
DOCTOR: Down! <br>
(Leela and the Doctor take cover behind a fallen tree, and the building
explodes in a ball of flames which expand at first, then contract back
to the point of origin, burning furiously.) <br>
LEELA: What now? <br>
DOCTOR: We leave. Vanishing priories take a lot of explaining. <br>
LEELA: Will the other be all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Probably at Mrs Tyler's now, eating plum cake off her best
china. </font></p>

LEELA: What are you going to do about the skull? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, find a star about to go supernova and dump it in the
vicinity. <br>
LEELA: That will destroy it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I don't think even that can stand the temperatures
generated by a supernova. Ah! <br>
LEELA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Found one, in the constellation of Canthares. Just set the
coordinates, and we're on our way. <br>
(Leela is back in her dark brown leathers with her hair down.) <br>
LEELA: Then what are we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: I like your new dress. <br>
LEELA: It's the old one. <br>

DOCTOR: What? <br>
LEELA: You didn't finish. <br>
DOCTOR: Didn't finish what? <br>
LEELA: Your sentence. It's a very annoying habit, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes. Well, it's about K, K <br>
LEELA: K9? <br>
DOCTOR: K9. Yes. I'd better finish repairing him. <br>
LEELA: Ah! You called him him. You called him him! <br>
DOCTOR: I can call K9 him if I want to. He's my dog. Aren't you, K9? <br>
