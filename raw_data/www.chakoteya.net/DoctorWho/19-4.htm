<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In Restoration England, night is falling. The old
family retainer brings a three stick candelabra into the main room
where his master is dozing by the fire and the son is cleaning a
flintlock pistol, and takes away another that has nearly burnt out.
Outside in the entrance hall, a young woman looks out of the window at
a pair of falling stars. There is a sudden series of explosions, like
fireworks.) <br>
ELIZABETH: Papa! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Manor house]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (She enters.) <br>
ELIZABETH: Papa! Papa! <br>
(She wakes the man dozing by the fire. Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0767644/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> John Savident</a>.) <br>
SQUIRE: Oh! What's all the noise Elizabeth? <br>
ELIZABETH: Have you seen the sky? It's beautiful. <br>
SQUIRE: What're you talking about? <br>
ELIZABETH: The whole sky is ablaze. <br>
(She looks through the curtains.) <br>
ELIZABETH: Oh! They've gone. <br>
SQUIRE: What have gone? <br>
ELIZABETH: The lights. <br>
SQUIRE: What sort of lights were they? <br>
ELIZABETH: Like a hundred shooting stars. I wish you'd seen them. <br>
SQUIRE: I don't like the sound of it. <br>
ELIZABETH: Papa. <br>
SQUIRE: Strange lights in the sky never bode well for the future. <br>
ELIZABETH: You're so old-fashioned. <br>
SQUIRE: Yes. <br>
(Elizabeth kisses her father on the cheek while he harrumphs. <br>
Outside, something metal and non-period has half buried itself in the
ground and is making strange noises. <br>
Elizabeth and her father settle to their game of chess while his son
continues to clean the gun.) <br>
SQUIRE: Ralph! Bring a log! <br>
RALPH [OC] Yes, sir! <br>
SQUIRE: I feel a chill. <br>
ELIZABETH: You can't, Papa. It's a perfectly warm evening. <br>
CHARLES: Father always feels a chill when he's losing. It's either that
or his gout bothers him. <br>
SQUIRE: Arrant nonsense! <br>
(The servant, Ralph, enters.) <br>
SQUIRE: I feel a definite chill about me shoulders. <br>
(The candles flicker in a draught.) <br>
SQUIRE: There you are, you see. Have you left the door open? <br>
RALPH: Me, sir? No. Would you like me to fetch your shawl? <br>
SQUIRE: No. Er, no, I think I'd prefer a warmer. I'll have me posset
now. <br>
RALPH: Yes, sir. <br>
(Ralph leaves.) <br>
CHARLES: You're incorrigible, Father. Haven't you drunk enough already?
<br>
SQUIRE: This is medicinal. <br>
CHARLES: I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Father.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Whilst Charles puts the finishing polish on the
wood of his flintlock, something with a bad case of bronchitis is going
down the cellar steps.) <br>
RALPH: Are you sure you're not having a posset, Master Charles? <br>
CHARLES: No, thank you. <br>
RALPH: In that case I'll bid you good night, sir. <br>
CHARLES: Good night, Ralph. <br>
(Ralph goes down the stairs and sees whatever it is that is breathing
heavily. He cries out, turns and the thing shoots him in the back with
a green beam. Charles appears, and fires two pistol shots at it, then
returns to the gun cabinet to load a musket. The Squire enters as he is
ramming the wad down the barrel.) <br>
SQUIRE: Oh! It's you, sir. What the Hades is going on? <br>
CHARLES: There's someone down there with a gun the likes I've never
seen before. <br>
SQUIRE: Ralph. Where's Ralph? <br>
CHARLES: I fear he's hit. <br>
(A flash of green blasts a pewter plate on top of the gun cabinet.) <br>
SQUIRE: Fire and brimstone! <br>
(They turn and see their attacker.) <br>
SQUIRE: God protect us! <br>
(The Squire fires a pair of pistols, and the unseen enemy squeals then
falls to the floor.) <br>
SQUIRE: What was that? <br>
CHARLES: I don't know!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A silver-gloved fist punches its way through the
door.) <br>
ELIZABETH: Papa! What's happening, Papa? <br>
(Charles and the Squire enter.) <br>
CHARLES: Take this. <br>
(Charles hands Elizabeth a musket. The men have one each.) <br>
SQUIRE: Would it be too obvious to say, we are under attack? <br>
ELIZABETH: But from whom? <br>
(A brightly decorated android enters. It is red and blue, with a white
head that has a diamond shaped gem in the forehead.) <br>
SQUIRE: From whatever that is. <br>
CHARLES: Our shots stopped its comrade on the stairs. <br>
SQUIRE: But this one's in armour. <br>
CHARLES: Which at this range is useless. Come on, Father, now! <br>
(They all discharge their weapons. <br>
When dawn breaks on the Tithe Barn at Hurley, Buckinghamshire, there is
the sound of machinery somewhere.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Nyssa is reading a magazine.) <br>
DOCTOR: How many times have I told you, Adric, not to interfere with,
with things that you don't understand. <br>
ADRIC: I was trying to escape. <br>
DOCTOR: In the TSS? You were lucky you didn't destroy the whole Kinda
tribe. <br>
ADRIC: I didn't realise it would be that difficult to control. <br>
DOCTOR: That isn't the point. You should never have got into that unit.
<br>
ADRIC: Well, as it turned out no one was hurt. <br>
DOCTOR: Apart from Aris. <br>
ADRIC: A flesh wound. <br>
DOCTOR: Try to understand, Adric, because you get away with something,
it doesn't justify it. <br>
ADRIC: I'm sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: Next time you want to escape from somewhere, walk. <br>
NYSSA: Poor old Adric. Always in trouble. <br>
ADRIC: And I try so hard. <br>
DOCTOR: Is Tegan ready? <br>
NYSSA: I'll check. <br>
(Nyssa goes into the Tardis interior. Something beeps on the console.) <br>
ADRIC: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: A fault. <br>
ADRIC: Serious? <br>
DOCTOR: Must be the lateral balance cones again. You know, I must do
some maintenance after we've delivered Tegan. <br>
ADRIC: It's going to seem strange without her, though I must admit I'm
not entirely convinced that she likes me. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, don't jump to conclusions, Adric. Sometimes we humanoids
try to disguise our, our true feelings. Well, don't just stand there,
Adric, help me.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan puts the finishing touches to her lipstick
and primps her hair. Then she stops and stares at her reflection in the
dressing table mirror.) <br>
NYSSA: What's the matter? <br>
TEGAN: It's only sunk in properly, what happened to me on Deva Loka. <br>
NYSSA: What? The Doctor said nothing eventful had occurred. <br>
TEGAN: He would. But while you were enjoying forty eight hours peaceful
sleep in the delta wave augmenter, my mind was occupied. Taken over. <br>
NYSSA: By whom? <br>
TEGAN: More a what. Something called a Mara. It makes me shiver to
think of it. <br>
NYSSA: You weren't hurt? <br>
TEGAN: No. No, but that's not the point. It's unnerved me. <br>
NYSSA: You'll soon be on Earth with all this unpleasantness forgotten. <br>
TEGAN: Can't wait. <br>
NYSSA: At leas, you won't have any awkward questions to answer about
where you've been. <br>
TEGAN: So the Doctor says. I don't understand how. <br>
NYSSA: Just accept what he says. <br>
(Tegan fastens her jacket and takes her shoulder bag from Nyssa.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NYSSA: You'll arrive back at the airport exactly
on time for your flight, half an hour after you entered the Tardis. <br>
TEGAN: Some half hour. Now I have to pretend that nothing's happened in
the mean time. <br>
NYSSA: You'll soon settle down. <br>
TEGAN: I hope so. Nyssa, I know I haven't always been the best of
companions. I'll miss you. All of you. <br>
(The girls hug.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Earth, Heathrow, 1981. <br>
ADRIC: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Not one of the most stimulating places in the universe, but
nevertheless, where requested to be. <br>
ADRIC: Doctor? <br>
(The scanner shows a woodland walk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. <br>
(Tegan and Nyssa enter.) <br>
TEGAN: Is that supposed to be Heathrow? <br>
ADRIC: It is. <br>
TEGAN: Well, they've certainly let the grass grow since I was last
there. <br>
ADRIC: Well, actually, they haven't built the airport yet. We're about
three hundred years early. <br>
TEGAN: That's great. Perhaps I can go out, file a claim on the land.
When they get round to inventing the aircraft, I'll make a fortune. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes, a small error has been made. <br>
TEGAN: You call three hundred years a small error? <br>
DOCTOR: It's probably due to nothing more than a temperamental solenoid
on the lateral balance cones. <br>
TEGAN: Why do you always have some incomprehensible answer? <br>
DOCTOR: And, as you know, the Tardis isn't always <br>
(A handle comes off in the Doctor's hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Er, reliable. <br>
TEGAN: Call yourself a Time Lord? A broken clock keeps better time than
you do. At least it's accurate twice a day, which is more than you ever
are. <br>
(Tegan opens the Tardis door and storms out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why does she always overreact? <br>
NYSSA: I think she's finding the idea of going more painful than she
thought. <br>
DOCTOR: Then why didn't she say so, rather than fly off the handle like
that. <br>
NYSSA: That's Tegan. <br>
ADRIC: Perhaps you'd better talk to her. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Too much has been said already. Earthlings.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Supposedly in the region of Staines, Hounslow,
Colebrook or Egham, but really Black Park, Fulmer, Buckinghamshire.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I realise how disappointed you must be. <br>
TEGAN: I'm sorry, too, but you did make a promise. <br>
DOCTOR: And I'll keep it. Consider this a fortuitous mistake. It isn't
everyone who gets the chance to wander round their own history. <br>
TEGAN: I'm not sure I want to. This place stinks. <br>
DOCTOR: What? I suppose it does a bit. <br>
ADRIC: Look, Doctor. <br>
(Smoke is drifting through the trees.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sulphur. <br>
ADRIC: Some sort of volcanic action? <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong time and place for that. <br>
TEGAN: Are you sure this is Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: Undoubtedly. When we find the person who's burning the sulphur,
perhaps you'll believe him.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Woodland]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In a clearing, two villagers stack wood on the
smouldering pile. They have tied their kerchiefs around their faces to
keep out the fumes. Very wise. A third signals from his position
halfway up a tall tree as the Tardis crew walk beneath.) <br>
VILLAGER: Four strangers coming this way. <br>
(The woodsmen pick up cudgels that are leaning against a tree.) <br>
NYSSA: Is it sensible to go on? <br>
DOCTOR: Probably not. <br>
TEGAN: I've lost my bearings already. <br>
DOCTOR: There's potassium nitrate in with the sulphur. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, that's great. <br>
ADRIC: What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Potassium nitrate and sulphur are constituents of a primitive
explosive. Gunpowder. <br>
TEGAN: I don't like this place. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor! <br>
(The villagers are coming down the track.) <br>
TEGAN: Shouldn't we get back to the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: This time I agree. <br>
(But two more villagers are behind them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Good morning. <br>
(The villagers attack with cudgels, but are easily disposed of.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, back to the Tardis. <br>
(The crew run off, and the other three villagers arrive.) <br>
VILLAGER: You all right? Don't worry, we'll get them. <br>
(Further on.) <br>
NYSSA: Now which way? <br>
ADRIC: I don't know. <br>
NYSSA: Use your homing devise. <br>
ADRIC: I must have dropped it during the fight. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, tremendous. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. This way. <br>
(He runs on, then stops. The three youngsters carry on ahead and he
dashes to catch them up. <br>
(Then Adric falls over a tree root.) <br>
ADRIC: Ow! <br>
NYSSA: Are you all right? <br>
ADRIC: I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: There's nothing broken. Can you stand? <br>
ADRIC: I'll try. <br>
NYSSA: Lean on me. <br>
ADRIC: I'll be all right in a minute. <br>
TEGAN: We may not have a minute. <br>
(The plummy tones of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0730425/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Michael
Robbins</a> come down from a fork in a nearby tree. Unlike
everyone else so far, this person is dressed in more Cavalier fashion.)
<br>
MACE: Can I be of any assistance? <br>
DOCTOR: Can you help us? <br>
MACE: I have a convenient refuge nearby. <br>
TEGAN: How do we know we can trust him? <br>
MACE: You have little choice. You either trust me or give yourselves up
to your pursuers, who would probably cudgel you to death. <br>
(Mace fires his brace of pistols at the approaching villagers, who
retreat rapidly behind a tree. He jumps down from his perch.) <br>
MACE: I don't think they will bother us again. If the lad can walk, my
camp is this way. <br>
DOCTOR: Lead on, sir. <br>
(The villagers watch them lead from their hiding place.) <br>
VILLAGER: Go back to the village for help. We'll follow them.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barn]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: This is home? <br>
MACE: For the last night or two. Fortune has made me itinerant. <br>
DOCTOR: Why were those men following us? <br>
MACE: You don't know? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we're new to the area. <br>
MACE: You must be new to the world, sir. Have not you heard there is
plague? <br>
(Ah, so this is 1665 or 1666.) <br>
TEGAN: Where? <br>
MACE: Everywhere. That is why the village is guarded so vigilantly.
They're terrified of strangers and the pestilence they may carry. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. The reason for the sulphuric smoke. Purification
fires. <br>
NYSSA: Is that why you're not staying in the village? <br>
MACE: Alas, because of the plague, everywhere is unfriendly. <br>
DOCTOR: Hence the guns. <br>
MACE: No, not entirely. I was once a noted thespian until forced into
rural exile by the closure of the theatres. It is only with the aid of
these properties I am able to command the attention of an audience
nowadays. <br>
TEGAN: You sound like a highwayman or a robber. <br>
MACE: A gentleman of the road, madam. Richard Mace at your service. <br>
(He doffs his hat and gives Tegan a bow with flourish.) <br>
MACE: Though I only plan to rob you of a little of your time and
company. After many weeks alone in the woods, I would risk anything for
an hour's good conversation. <br>
(Mace sits on a crate and waits.) <br>
MACE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: How bad is the plague? <br>
MACE: Oh, the worst I've ever seen. More virulent here than in the
city, but that's only to be expected. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
MACE: Did you not see the comet a few weeks ago? A portent of doom, if
ever I saw one. Its aurora barely faded from the sky before the first
local case was reported. <br>
ADRIC: You were clear until then? <br>
MACE: Oh, completely. <br>
DOCTOR: They're not due for a comet for years. <br>
MACE: It lit up the sky as I've never experienced it before. <br>
NYSSA: Are you sure it wasn't a meteor? <br>
MACE: Call it what you wish. I have seen many falling stars, but this
was without parallel. <br>
DOCTOR: Interesting, and so is the ornament around your neck. <br>
TEGAN: Doctor, don't you think we should be getting back to the Tardis?
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Not yet. May I see? <br>
MACE: Oh, surely. I found it in the loft last night. <br>
(He hands the object on a string to the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Interesting piece of work. What do you think? <br>
NYSSA: It's made from polygrite, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
NYSSA: From such a primitive society? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mind if I have a look around your loft? <br>
MACE: As you wish, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Fit for a climb, Adric? <br>
TEGAN: Doctor, he should rest. <br>
ADRIC: Don't worry, Tegan. We Alzarians are different from you. We
recover faster. <br>
(Adric follows the Doctor up the ladder into the hayloft.) <br>
NYSSA: Is there anything I can do? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh, have a look round down there. <br>
TEGAN: What exactly are we looking for?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Hayloft]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ADRIC: What is it he's wearing? <br>
DOCTOR: Part of an alien bracelet made for a very special purpose. <br>
ADRIC: How could it have got here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, make your own guess. A comet when there shouldn't have been
a comet, a meteor that doesn't look like a meteor. Whatever the
phenomenon was, it certainly wasn't natural. <br>
ADRIC: Some sort of a spacecraft landing? <br>
DOCTOR: Or burning up in the atmosphere. <br>
ADRIC: But surely, for the bracelet to be here some of the crew must
have survived? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, not necessarily. The bracelet is strong enough to have
survived the crash. However, if we find something more fragile. <br>
ADRIC: Then there are survivors. <br>
DOCTOR: Correct.

DOCTOR: Well done! <br>

DOCTOR: Tell me, who owns this barn? <br>
MACE: I will show you.

then covers it over with a cloth. The Doctor leads his group through
the gate and some villagers gather to watch them.) <br>
VILLAGER: Now what are they up to? <br>
MACE: Surely you must be aware, sir, that there is a certain protocol
to be observed when approaching the gentry. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. I've met kings, emperors, megalomaniacs in my time. <br>
MACE: Ah, then you must know, sir, that the nobility will not take
kindly to being knocked up and questioned about the contents of their
barns. It's a sure way of us all being horse-whipped. And I have a
particularly sensitive skin, sir. <br>
(The Doctor walks on. The cart comes down the driveway, forcing Tegan,
Nyssa, Adric and Mace onto the grass.) <br>
NYSSA: Is the man blind? <br>
ADRIC: He nearly killed us. <br>
MACE: The miller. A man of very sour disposition. <br>
TEGAN: And not much road sense. <br>
(They join the Doctor at the front door to the house. The Doctor rings
the bell.) <br>
MACE: Shouldn't we use the tradesman's entrance? <br>
(The Doctor uses the impressive lion's head knocker.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm calling on the master of the house, not his servants. <br>
MACE: Please, sir, knock with a little more humility. <br>
DOCTOR: You knock while I look around. <br>

NYSSA: Why are you so certain the aliens have come here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not. For all I know they went to the village. <br>
NYSSA: They could also have died from the plague. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. So, the sooner we find out, the sooner we can return
Tegan to her own time. Anyone at home? <br>
NYSSA: Have you any idea who the aliens might be? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not really. Polygrite is found in many parts of the
universe. So are power packs. <br>
NYSSA: Why are you so concerned about them? They might be friendly. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if I'm right, the comet that actor saw was their ship
burning up in the atmosphere. They're probably stranded here,
desperate. They could wreak havoc. </font></p>

DOCTOR: There are weapons missing. <br>

DOCTOR: There. <br>

stairs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, assume it was an
accident. <br>
(There is a brick wall blocking the way into the cellar.) <br>
DOCTOR: But this isn't. <br>
NYSSA: Now what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you only build a staircase to lead somewhere. <br>
NYSSA: As a rule. <br>
DOCTOR: Why should anyone want to build a wall here? <br>
NYSSA: Does it matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this should be a very important staircase. Logically it
should lead from the main hall to the kitchens. <br>
NYSSA: Perhaps there's another way. <br>

I to do about these? <br>

MACE: Ah. Interesting device. Perfect! I once knew a French acrobat. He
wasn't very good at tumbling, but his skill with a piece of bent iron
was phenomenal. Luckily, he passed his skill onto me which enabled me
to extricate my fee from the strong boxes of more than one disreputable

investigate. Tegan pops up from behind a pile of boxes.) <br>

Adric tries kicking it, but it knocks him down. Adric takes its cloak
with him. The android pushes the Tardis doors wide open and goes

its weapon at the inner door and puts the mask on the console. Nyssa
puts on the headphones, waits a few seconds then switches on the sonic
disrupter, then hides behind a bed. The android enters as everything
starts to shake. It tries firing at the disrupter, but has no effect.
The vibrations increase and little trinket boxes bounce off the
dressing table. The android turns its fire on the power cable, but
smoke is beginning to come out of its joints. Finally the mechanical
man explodes. Nyssa comes out of hiding and turns off the disrupter,
then gets a small fire extinguisher to put out the fires in power cable
and the android's remains. Then she sits on the bed, takes off the
headphones and heaves a great sigh of relief. Adric enters, rubbing his
sore neck.) <br>

should check how much damage has been done to the Tardis. <br>

Earth. <br>
