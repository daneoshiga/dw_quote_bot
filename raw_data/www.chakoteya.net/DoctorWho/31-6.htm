chamber, a woman sits on a throne under a canopy, with her son standing
at her side. Her Steward leads in a man and his young daughter.) <br>
GUIDO: Signora, your school offers a chance for betterment, escape. My
daughter. Isabella is seventeen now, but what prospects are there for
the daughter of a boat builder? There's no future for us. No future but
you. <br>
ROSANNA: I am moved by your concern for your daughter. I believe
protecting the future of one's own is a sacred duty. <br>
GUIDO: Signora, she is my world. <br>
ROSANNA: Then we will take your world. <br>
(This makes Guido and his daughter very happy.) <br>
GUIDO: I knew it. <br>
ROSANNA: Say goodbye to your daughter. <br>
GUIDO: Now, signora? <br>
ROSANNA: Why wait? Time ticks. <br>
GUIDO: Be brave, my girl. Make me proud. <br>
(The Steward escorts Guido out.) <br>
ROSANNA: Step into the light, my dear. That's it. <br>
(Rosanna and her son circle her.) <br>
ROSANNA: What say you, Francesco? Do you like her? <br>
FRANCESCO: Oh, I do, Mother. I do. <br>
(Francesco shows his teeth. They are small and sharp, like a bat's.
Isabella screams.)

above the noise of his stag party. All the participants are wearing red
t-shirts with Rory's Stag on the back and a picture of Rory and Amy
inside a heart on the front.) <br>
RORY: Hey! It's me. Hello. How are you?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(He is talking to the answerphone.) <br>
RORY [OC]: The reason for this call is because I haven't told you for
seven hours that I love you, which is a scandal, and even if we weren't
getting married tomorrow, I'd ask you to marry me anyway. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Pub]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RORY: Yes, I would, because you are smashing. <br>
(A giant pink cake is wheeled in to the tune 'The Stripper'.) <br>
RORY: Oh. Oh. Oh, blimey. I've. I've, er got to go. I'll see you
tomorrow. <br>
(His companions push Rory forward.) <br>
ALL: Out. Out. Out. <br>
(The Doctor bursts out of the fake cake and silence falls.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rory! That's a relief. I thought I'd burst out of the wrong
cake, again. That reminds me, there's a girl standing outside in a
bikini. Could someone let her in and give her a jumper? Lucy? Lovely
girl. Diabetic. Now then, Rory. We need to talk about your
fiancée. She tried to kiss me. Tell you what, though. You're a lucky
man. She's a great kisser. <br>
(Someone drops his beer glass and it smashes on the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Funny how you can say something in your head and it sounds
fine.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is hanging underneath the console
platform, doing some welding. Rory and Amy are there.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the life out there, it dazzles. I mean, it blinds you to
the things that are important. I've seen it devour relationships and
plans. It's meant to do that. Because for one person to have seen all
that, to taste the glory and then go back, it will tear you apart. So,
I'm sending you somewhere, together. <br>
AMY: Whoa. What, like a date? <br>
DOCTOR: Anywhere you want. Any time you want. One condition. It has to
be amazing. The Moulin Rouge in 1890. The first Olympic Games. Think of
it as a wedding present, because it's either this or tokens. It's a lot
to take in, isn't it? Tiny box, huge room inside. What's that about?
Let me explain. <br>
RORY: It's another dimension. <br>
DOCTOR: It's basically another dimension. What? <br>
RORY: After what happened with Prisoner Zero, I've been reading up on
all the latest scientific theories. FTL travel, parallel universes. <br>
DOCTOR: I like the bit when someone says it's bigger on the inside. I
always look forward to that. <br>
AMY: So, this date. I'm kind of done with running down corridors. What
do you think, Rory? <br>
DOCTOR: How about somewhere romantic?

not even trying to hide.
Venice is being played by Trogir and other locations in Croatia.) <br>
DOCTOR: Venice. <br>
(We are given a view of the campanile of San Marco and I think the
Basilica, across a very wide canal with moored gondolas in the
foreground.) <br>
DOCTOR: Venezia. La Serenissima. Impossible city. Preposterous city.
Founded by refugees running from Attila the Hun. It was just a
collection of little wooden huts in the middle of the marsh, but became
one of the most powerful cities in the world. Constantly being invaded,
constantly flooding, constantly just beautiful. Ah, you got to love
Venice. So many people did. Byron, Napoleon, Casanova. Ooo, that
reminds me. 1580. That's all right. Casanova doesn't get born for a
hundred and forty five years. Don't want to run into him. I owe him a
chicken. <br>
RORY: You owe Casanova a chicken? <br>
DOCTOR: Long story. We had a bet. <br>
(The Doctor is stopped by an official.) <br>
INSPECTOR: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Papers, if you please. Proof
of residency, current bill of medical inspection. <br>
(The Doctor holds up his psychic paper.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you go, fellow. All to your satisfaction, I think you'll
find. <br>
INSPECTOR: I am so sorry, Your Holiness. I didn't realise. <br>
(The Doctor blesses the man.) <br>
DOCTOR: No worries. You were just doing your job. Sorry, what exactly
is your job? <br>
INSPECTOR: Checking for aliens. Visitors from foreign lands what might
bring the plague with them. <br>
AMY; Oh, that's nice. See where you bring me? The plague. <br>
INSPECTOR: Don't worry, Viscountess. No, we're under quarantine here.
No one comes in, no one goes out, and all because of the grace and
wisdom of our patron, Signora Rosanna Calvierri. <br>
DOCTOR: How interesting. I heard the plague died out years ago. <br>
INSPECTOR: Not out there. No, Signora Calvierri has seen it with her
own eyes. Streets are piled high with bodies, she said. <br>
DOCTOR: Did she now. <br>
(Rory takes the psychic paper from the Inspector, who moves on to his
next target.) <br>
INSPECTOR: Oi. <br>
RORY: Er, according to this, I am your eunuch. <br>
AMY: Oh yeah. I'll explain later. </font></p>

with white parasols and heavy veils on their heads walk out two by two.
<br>
WOMAN: Veils down, girls. <br>
GIRL [OC]: (sotto) The Calvierri girls. <br>
(The Doctor, Amy and Rory are across the canal from the procession.
Guido runs up to the girls.) <br>
WOMAN: What do you want? <br>
GUIDO: Where's my Isabella? <br>
WOMAN: What are you doing? Get away from there. <br>
(Guido lifts the girls veils until he finds his daughter.) <br>
GUIDO: Isabella? Isabella, it's me. <br>

GUIDO: I thought everyone knew about the Calvierri school. <br>
DOCTOR: My first day here. It's okay. Parents do all sorts of things to
get their children into good schools. They move house, they change
religion. So why are you trying to get her out? <br>
GUIDO: Something happens in there. Something magical, something evil.
My own daughter didn't recognise me. And the girl who pushed me away,
her face, like an animal. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's time I met this Signora Calvierri.

drinking deeply from a golden goblet.) <br>
FRANCESCO: Mother? <br>
ROSANNA: Mummy's hydrating, Francesco. <br>
FRANCESCO: And we never interrupt Mummy when she's hydrating. <br>
(Rosanna drains another goblet of liquid.) <br>
FRANCESCO: We were accosted again. A man made a grab for one of the
girls. The longer we wait, the greater the risk of discovery. I mean,
we've already converted more than enough. Surely it's time to introduce
them to my brothers? <br>
ROSANNA: I shall decide when we have enough. <br>
FRANCESCO: If it's more you want, let me take the girls into the city
tonight. We could <br>
ROSANNA: We follow the plan. Let them hammer on our door. Beg to be
taken.

RORY: And what have you been doing? <br>
AMY: Well, running, and fighting. I've been scared. More scared than I
thought was <br>
RORY: Did you miss me? <br>
AMY: I knew I'd be coming back. <br>
RORY: He was right. It blots out everything else. <br>
AMY: Rory, this is our date. Let's not do this. Not now. <br>
RORY: Huh. We are in Venice and it is 1580. <br>
AMY: I know. <br>
(Francesco watches them leave from a stairway.) <br>
FLOWER GIRL: Flowers, signor? <br>
(Francesco follows the flower girl around the corner, where she is
waiting for him. Rory is about to take a photograph of Amy in front of
a building when they hear a scream.) <br>
RORY: What was that? <br>
(They run back in time to see Francesco with blood on his sharp teeth
and the girl with two holes in her neck. Francesco hisses, raises his
cloak and leaves.) <br>
RORY: She'll be okay. Where are you? Amy, come back! <br>

straight onto the canal.)

water gate and sonic his way in.) <br>

daughter. <br>

with a vaulted roof. There is an ornate mirror on one wall
opposite 3 doors.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, handsome. <br>
(As he adjusts his tie in the mirror, girls in white robes appear
behind him. They have no reflections.) <br>
VAMPIRES: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: How are you doing that? I am loving it. You're like Houdini,
only five slightly scary girls, and he was shorter. Will be shorter.
I'm rambling. <br>
VAMPIRES: I'll ask you again, signor. Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Why don't you check this out? <br>
(The Doctor holds out an ID card with William Hartnell's photograph on
it. The girls stare at it blankly, then the Doctor looks at it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Library card. Of course, it's with. He's. I need a spare. Pale,
creepy girls who don't like sunlight and can't be seen. Ha. Am I
thinking what I think I'm thinking? But the city. Why shut down the
city? Unless <br>

are lucky. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo. <br>

Doctor, hissing.) <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me the whole plan. (sotto) One day that will work. Listen,
I would love to stay here. This whole thing. I'm thrilled. Oh, this is

DOCTOR: And creepy girls and everything. <br>
AMY: Vampires. <br>
RORY: We think we just saw a vampire. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Amy was just telling me. <br>
AMY: Yeah, yeah. The Doctor actually went to their house. <br>
RORY: Oh. Right. Well. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. So, first we need to get back in there somehow. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A vellum map of Venice is laid on the table.) <br>
GUIDO: As you saw, there's no clear way in. The House of Calvierri is
like a fortress. But there's a tunnel underneath it, with a ladder and
shaft that leads up into the house. I tried to get in once myself, but
I hit a trapdoor. <br>
AMY: You need someone on the inside. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
AMY: You don't even know what I was going to say. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, that we pretend you're an applicant for the school to get
you inside, and tonight you come down and open the trapdoor to let us
in. <br>
AMY: Oh. So you do know what I was going to say. <br>
RORY: Are you insane? <br>
AMY: We don't have another option. <br>
RORY: He said no, Amy. Listen to him. <br>
GUIDO: There is another option. <br>
(Guido points to the collection of barrels behind Rory.) <br>
GUIDO: I work at the Arsenale. We build the warships for the navy. <br>
(The Doctor sniffs the barrels.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gunpowder. Most people just nick stationery from where they
work. Look, I have a thing about guns and huge quantities of explosive.
<br>
GUIDO: What do you suggest, then? We wait until they turn her into an
animal? <br>
AMY: I'll be there three, four hours, tops. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It can't keep
happening like this. This is how they go. But I have to know. We go
together, say you're my daughter. <br>
RORY: What? Don't listen to him. <br>
AMY: Your daughter? You look about nine. <br>
DOCTOR: Brother, then. <br>
AMY: Too weird. Fiancé. <br>
RORY: I'm not having him run around telling people he's your fiancé. <br>
AMY: No. No, you're right. <br>
RORY: Thank you. <br>
AMY: I mean, they've already seen the Doctor. You should do it. <br>
RORY: Me? <br>
AMY: Yeah. You can be my brother. <br>
RORY: Why is him being your brother weird, but with me, it's okay? <br>
RORY: Actually, I thought you were her fiancé. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's not helping. <br>
RORY: This whole thing is mental. They're vampires, for God's sake. <br>
DOCTOR: We hope. <br>
AMY: So if they're not vampires? <br>
DOCTOR: Makes you wonder what could be so bad it doesn't actually mind
us thinking it's a vampire. </font></p>

dressing in appropriate costume.) <br>
RORY: So, basically, both of our parents are dead from getting the
plague. I'm a gondola driver, so money's a bit tight, so having my
sister go to your school for special people would be brilliant. Cheers.
<br>
FRANCESCO: Have we met? <br>
RORY: I've just got one of those faces. <br>
FRANCESCO: I wasn't talking to you. <br>
RORY: She's got the same face, which is because she's my sister. <br>
ROSANNA: Carlo, explain yourself. Why have you brought me this
imbecile? <br>
(Carlo is the Steward.) <br>
CARLO: Signora, they have references from His Majesty the King of
Sweden. <br>
ROSANNA: What? Let me see. <br>
(Rory steps forward with the psychic paper whilst Francesco circles
Amy.) <br>
ROSANNA: Well, now I see what got my Steward so excited. What say you,
Francesco? Do you like her? <br>
FRANCESCO: Oh, I do, Mother. I do. <br>
ROSANNA: Then we would be delighted to accept her. Say goodbye to your
sister. <br>

AMY: Blimey. This is private education, then? <br>

ISABELLA: Isabella. <br>
AMY: Listen, we're going to get you out of here, but I need you to tell
me what's going on. What is this place? What are they doing? <br>
ISABELLA: They er, they come at night. They gather around my bed, and
they take me to a room with this green light and a chair with straps,
as if for a surgeon. <br>

thirty years. <br>

metal bolts. She starts to leave and walks into Carlo, dropping her
candle.) <br>
DOCTOR: She was frightened. I was frightened. But we survived, you
know, and the relief of it, and so she kissed me. <br>
RORY: And you kissed her back. <br>
DOCTOR: No. I kissed her mouth. <br>
RORY: Funny. <br>

been you. It should have been you. <br>

DOCTOR: Maybe not everyone survives the process. <br>

make it so they don't want to let you down. You have no idea how
dangerous you make people to themselves when you're around. <br>

AMY: I saw them. I saw her. They're not vampires, they're aliens. <br>

RORY: That's good news? What is wrong with you people? <br>

ISABELLA: Something touched my leg! They're all around me. They bite! <br>

throne.) <br>
DOCTOR: Long way from Saturnyne, aren't you, Sister of the Water? <br>
ROSANNA: No, let me guess. The owner of the psychic paper. Then I take
it you're a refugee, like me? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll make you a deal. An answer for an answer. You're using a
perception filter. It doesn't change your features, but manipulates the
brainwaves of the person looking at you. But seeing one of you for the
first time in, say, a mirror, the brain doesn't know what to fill the
gap with, so leaves it blank, hence no reflection. <br>
ROSANNA: Your question? <br>
DOCTOR: Why can we see your big teeth? <br>
ROSANNA: Self preservation over rides the mirage. The subconscious
perceives the threat and tries to alert the conscious brain. <br>
DOCTOR: Where's Isabella? <br>
ROSANNA: My turn. Where are you from? <br>
DOCTOR: Gallifrey. <br>
ROSANNA: You should be in a museum. Or in a mausoleum. <br>
DOCTOR: Why are you here? <br>
ROSANNA: We ran from the Silence. Why are you here? <br>
DOCTOR: Wedding present. The Silence? <br>
ROSANNA: There were cracks. Some were tiny. Some were as big as the
sky. Through some we saw worlds and people, and through others we saw
Silence and the end of all things. We fled to an ocean like ours, and
the crack snapped shut behind us. Saturnyne was lost. <br>
DOCTOR: So Earth is to become Saturnyne Mark Two? <br>
ROSANNA: And you can help me. We can build a new society here, as
others have. What do you say? <br>
DOCTOR: Where's Isabella? <br>
ROSANNA: Isabella? <br>
DOCTOR: The girl who saved my friend. <br>
ROSANNA: Oh, deserters must be executed. Any general will tell you
that. I need an answer, Doctor. A partnership. Any which way you
choose. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think that's such a good idea, do you? I'm a Time Lord.
You're a big fish. Think of the children. <br>
ROSANNA: Carlo? You're right. We're nothing alike. I will bend the
heavens to save my race, while you philosophise. <br>
(Carlo enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: This ends today. I will tear down the House of Calvierri, stone
by stone. Take your hands off me, Carlo. And you know why? You didn't
know Isabella's name. You didn't know Isabella's name. <br>

GUIDO: I say we take the fight to them. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, ah, ah. <br>
GUIDO: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Her planet dies, so they flee through a crack in space and
time and end up here. Then she closes off the city and, one by one,
starts changing the people into creatures like her to start a new gene
pool. Got it. But then what? They come from the sea. They can't survive
for ever on land, so what's she going to do? Unless she's going to do
something to the environment to make the city habitable. She said, I
shall bend the heavens to save my race. Bend the heavens. Bend the
heavens. She's going to sink Venice. <br>
GUIDO: She's going to sink Venice? <br>
DOCTOR: And repopulate it with the girls she's transformed. <br>
RORY: You can't repopulate somewhere with just women. You need blokes. <br>
AMY: She's got blokes. <br>
DOCTOR: Where? <br>
AMY: In the canal. She said to me there are ten thousand husbands
waiting in the water. <br>
DOCTOR: Only the male offspring survived the journey here. She's got
ten thousand children swimming around the canals, waiting for Mum to
make them some compatible girlfriends. Urgh. I mean, I've been around a
bit, but really that's, that's eugh. <br>

DOCTOR: The people upstairs are very noisy. <br>
GUIDO: There aren't any people upstairs. <br>

know he was going to say that? <br>
