(The Doctor is giving us, the viewers, a lecture.) <br>
DOCTOR: So there's this man. He has a time machine. Up and down history he goes, zip zip zip zip zip, getting into scrapes. <br>
(He goes up to the gallery.)<br>
DOCTOR: Another thing he has is a passion for the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. <br>
(Holds up a vinyl LP of Beethoven's 5th.)<br>
DOCTOR: And one day he thinks, what's the point of having a time machine 
if you don't get to meet your heroes? So off he goes to eighteenth century Germany. But he can't find Beethoven anywhere.
 No one's heard of him, not even his family have any idea who the time traveller is talking about. <br>
(He swaps the LP for a plaster bust of Ludwig and walks down the stairs.)<br>
DOCTOR: Beethoven literally doesn't exist. This didn't happen, by the way. I've met Beethoven. Nice chap. Very intense. 
Loved an arm-wrestle. No, this is called the Bootstrap Paradox. Google it. The time traveller panics. <br>
(The bust is put down on a pile of sheet music.)<br>
DOCTOR: He can't bear the thought of a world 
without the music of Beethoven. Luckily he'd brought all of his Beethoven sheet music for Ludwig to sign. 
So he copies out all the concertos, and the symphonies and <em>he</em> gets them published. He becomes Beethoven. And history continues with barely a feather ruffled. 
But my question is this. Who put those notes and phrases together? Who really composed Beethoven's Fifth?<br>
(The
Doctor has finished plugging in his electric guitar and plays - da da
da dah! da da da dah! And now, back to our drama.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(This is a 
completely fake town, with Russian signs and cardboard
cut-out people for target practice. There is no evidence of recent MOD 
usage. The Tardis has landed on the fake railway platform, I think.)<br>
DOCTOR: Where's Bennett? We need to get going. <br>
O'DONNELL: Oh, he's still throwing up. One small step for man, one
giant bleaurgh. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, time travel does that sometimes. <br>
O'DONNELL: Somehow I doubt that Rose or Martha or Amy lost their
breakfast on their first trip. <br>
DOCTOR: You seem to know an awful lot about me. <br>
O'DONNELL: I used to be in military intelligence. I was demoted for
dangling a colleague out of a window. <br>
DOCTOR: In anger? <br>
O'DONNELL: Is there another way to dangle someone out a window? What
year are we in? <br>
(The Doctor wets a finger and holds it up.)<br>
DOCTOR: 1980. <br>
O'DONNELL: So, pre-Harold Saxon. Pre-the Minister of War. Pre-the moon
exploding and a big bat coming out. <br>
DOCTOR: The Minister of War? <br>
O'DONNELL: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: No, never mind. I expect I'll find out soon enough. <br>
(Bennett comes out of the Tardis and closes the door.)<br>
BENNETT: Sorry about that. Had a prawn sandwich. Might have been off. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha. Don't worry. Shall we go? <br>
O'DONNELL: Just one sec, I've just
got something in my boot. <br>
(The Doctor walks away. O'Donnell jumps up and down in excitement.)<br>
O'DONNELL: It's bigger on the inside, it's bigger on the
inside, it's bigger on the inside. How can it be bigger on the inside,
Bennett? (sobers up) Okay, let's roll.</font></p>

BENNETT: Why have we gone to Russia? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, we haven't. We're still in Scotland. This is the town
before it flooded. The Tardis has brought us to when
the spaceship first touched down. But here and now, it's the height of
the Cold War.
The military were being trained for offensives on Soviet soil. <br>
(They find the spaceship with its rear ramp down, parked in front of
the Orthodox Church.)</font></font></p>

place, and a wrapped mummy is lying on the other one.)<br>
O'DONNELL: Oh, is that the pilot? My God, look at size of it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's the body. <br>
(Bennett opens the floor hatch where the two power cells are.)<br>
O'DONNELL: What do you mean, the body? <br>
DOCTOR: This isn't just any spaceship. It's a hearse. <br>
BENNETT: The suspended animation chamber's still here, and the power
cells for the engine. <br>
O'DONNELL: And there are no markings on the
wall. <br>
DOCTOR: Yet.<br>

</font></font>&nbsp;PRENTIS: Remarkable. Oh, and humans, too.&nbsp; Albar Prentis, Funeral
Director. <br>
(He hands out business cards. Albar Prentis Universal Funeral Director. 
May the remorse be with you. The Doctor throws his away.)<br>
BENNETT: You're from Tivoli, aren't you? <br>
PRENTIS: The most invaded
planet in the galaxy!
Our capital city has a sign saying, if you occupied us, you'd be home
by now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I've had dealings with
your lot before.
I can't say I'm a fan. <br>
PRENTIS: No, we do tend to antagonise. (laughs)<br>
(O'Donnell hears a noise and looks away briefly.)<br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing here?
<br>
PRENTIS: Ah, yes. Of course.
(runs up the ramp) This
is the Fisher King.
He and his armies invaded Tivoli and
enslaved us for ten glorious years!
Until we were
liberated by the Arcateenians.
But, thank the Gods,
soon we'd irritated them
so much, they enslaved us, too! (laughs)<br>
BENNETT: My first proper alien, and he's an idiot. <br>
PRENTIS: And now, in accordance with
Arcateenian custom,
I've come to bury him
on a barren, savage outpost. <br>
O'DONNELL: You mean the town? <br>
DOCTOR: He means the planet. <br>
(Prentis runs back down the ramp to the Doctor.)<br>
PRENTIS: Although, at the risk of starting
a bidding war, <em>you</em> could enslave me.
In the ship I have
directions to my planet
and a selection of items that you can
oppress me with. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, we've come from the future.
You're about to send some sort of
signal.
How do you do it? Is it
a special pen? <br>
PRENTIS: What are you talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: The technology you use. The thing that wrenches the soul
out of the body and makes it repeat
your coordinates for eternity.
Give it to me now, I'm going
to take the batteries out. <br>
PRENTIS: We don't have anything like that. (laughs)
Even this belongs to the
glorious Arcateenians. <br>
DOCTOR: So who sends the message? <br>
(Prentis sniffs at the Doctor. They look up at the mummy on the slab.)<br>
DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis.
I need to talk to Clara. <br>

outside. Lunn approaches Clara who is sitting apart.)<br>
LUNN: You've bee here before,
in situations like this before. <br>
CLARA: Yeah, not exactly like, but, yeah, once or twice. <br>
LUNN: So you've had to deal with
people who are scared.
What do you say to them?
I'm asking what I should say to you. <br>
CLARA: That it will be all right. That the
Doctor will save us. <br>
LUNN: And when you say it,
do you believe it? <br>
CLARA: Yeah. Yeah, I do. <br>
LUNN: And now? <br>
(Cass attracts their attention by slapping her chair back.)<br>
LUNN: Cass thinks the Doctor's saying
something different to the others.
He's saying Moran Pritchard Apprentice.
No, Prentis O'Donnell Clara Doctor Bennett Cass&nbsp; <br>
It's a list of all our names
and when he finishes, he just
goes back to the beginning again,
over and over. That's it. <br>
CLARA: Who's Prentis? <br>
(Her mobile phone rings.)<br>
CLARA: It's the Doctor. <br>
LUNN: He's alive? <br>
CLARA: For the moment. <br>
(Lunn signs the good news to Cass.)<br>
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor, are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Yeah, fine. So listen,

on a table, Clara on the scanner.)<br>
DOCTOR: Clara, what's wrong? <br>
CLARA: Another ghost has appeared. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Who? Has someone died? <br>
CLARA: Doctor,
it's you. Are you okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Well, currently. <br>
CLARA: What does it mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It means I die. <br>
CLARA: No, not necessarily. We can change
the sequence of events so <br>
DOCTOR: This isn't a potential future. This is the future
now.&nbsp; It's already happened.
The proof is right
there in front of you.
I have to die. <br>
CLARA: No.
You can change things. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't.
Even the tiniest change, the
ramifications could be catastrophic.
It could spread carnage
and chaos across the universe
like ripples on a pond. Oh, well, I've had a good innings.
(to O'Donnell) This regeneration, it's
a bit of a clerical error anyway. (to Clara)
I've got to go sometime. <br>
CLARA: <em>Not with me</em>!
Die with whoever comes after me.
You do <em>not</em> leave <em>me</em>. <br>
DOCTOR: Clara, I need to talk to you
just on your own. <br>
(They pick up their respective handsets.)<br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me.
We all have to face death
eventually, be it ours or someone else's. <br>
CLARA: I'm not ready yet.
I don't want to
think about that, not yet. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't change what's already
happened. There are rules. <br>
CLARA: So break them.
And anyway, you owe me.
You've made yourself essential to me.
You've given me something else to,
to be. And you can't do that
and then die. It's not fair. <br>
DOCTOR: Clara. <br>
CLARA: No.
Doctor, I don't care about your
rules or your bloody survivor's
guilt.
If you love me in any way,
you'll come back.
Doctor, are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I can't save Moran or Pritchard. <br>
CLARA: No, but like you said, if you can, if you can
find out why this is happening,
maybe you can stop them killing
anybody else, you can save us.
And you can stop it
happening to you. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll do what I can,
but the future has already happened.
We've just met the Undertaker
and he's still alive. <br>
(Prentis is making notes in a book as he walks
into the spaceship and discovers that the mummy wrappings are empty. He
gasps, sniff, then turns and sees the symbols scratched into the bulkhead. A
very large shadow looms in the opening to the spaceship. We are treated to an external view of the spaceship and hear a loud
roar. <br>
In the Tardis, the private conversation is over and the Doctor
goes back to speaker mode.)<br>
DOCTOR: So. Ghost me. You've got a better view than me.
How do I look?
Any signs of trauma, any scars?
Any clues as to how I die? <br>
CLARA: No, nothing.
You're the same as all the other
ghosts with the weird black
eyes and.
No. No, wait. Your coat.
It's torn. The right shoulder. <br>
(She holds up the phone to broadcast the image.)<br>
DOCTOR: I assume I'm just saying
the same thing as the others. <br>
CLARA: No. You're saying a list of names.
Our names, mainly. Moran, Pritchard, Prentis,
O'Donnell, Clara, Doctor, Bennett, Cass.
Who's Prentis? <br>
DOCTOR: The mole-faced chap.
<br>
(Ghost Doctor comes through the window. Clara drops the phone on a
table for a moment.)<br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter, Clara,
what's happening? <br>
CLARA: You've moved inside.
You're inside here now. <br>
DOCTOR: What am I doing? <br>
CLARA: Er, nothing. You're,
you're just standing there. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not trying to kill you?
Why am I not trying to kill you? <br>
CLARA: No, wait, you're moving,
going toward the control panel. <br>
(The ghost calls up the Faraday cage in sector 4. Status: closed
changes to open.)<br>
CLARA: Oh, no.
He's opened the Faraday cage.
He's let the other ghosts out. <br>
DOCTOR: I need to talk to me now. <br>
CLARA: Didn't you hear me?
You opened the Faraday cage.
The other ghosts are outside.
Shouldn't we be hiding? <br>
DOCTOR: In a minute.
I need to talk to the ghost me. <br>
(Clara puts the phone on its long edge, on a cabinet.)<br>
CLARA: Okay, Doctor, you're on. <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor. Such an honour.
I've always been a huge admirer.
This is really a delight.
Finally someone worth talking to.
So firstly, why are you here? <br>
(Ghost Doctor turns away.)<br>
DOCTOR: Clara? Clara, what's happening? <br>
(She retrieves her phone.)<br>
CLARA: Er.
Er, you, you've just stopped.
Oh, no, wait, you've started again.
<br>
CASS via LUNN: His message has changed. He's saying something
different.
He's saying <br>
CLARA: What?<br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LUNN: What?
<br>
CASS via LUNN: He's saying, the chamber will open tonight. <br>
DOCTOR: Clara, now the ghosts are out,
go to the Faraday cage.
They won't be able to get
you in there. Oh, there's a problem. <br>
CLARA: Problem? What problem? Oh, really? Because
everything else is going so
smoothly <br>
DOCTOR: The phone signal won't be able to get through.
What you'll have to do,
Clara, put the phone outside,
and you can watch it through
the little round porthole. And when you see it ringing, if it's
safe to do so, go out and answer it. <br>
CLARA: Okay, how long are you going to <br>
DOCTOR: Clara, listen to me.
Don't let that phone
out of your sight.
I need to be able to reach you, I
need to know everything my ghost
does.
Do you understand?
I'll come back for you. I swear. <br>

Not you, O'Donnell. <br>

and mind the shop.
What if Clara calls? <br>
O'DONNELL: The last bloke that said
something like that to me
got dangled out of a window. <br>

Go on, Bennett.

(She has to dodge around a corner near a tableau of a living room
while the Doctor and Bennett make it into a fake bathroom at the end. Bennett
jams a chair under the door handle.<br>
Something big is stomping and
roaring as it approaches. It passes a broken window in the room where
the Doctor and Bennett are hiding. The sounds fade. O'Donnell steps out
of her hiding place, and a large shadow is cast over her. She turns.
Big
roar. Bennett pulls the chair from the door.)<br>
DOCTOR: No, Bennett! Wait!

(Bennett runs to where O'Donnell is lying on the floor, moaning, He
kneels and takes her hand, then takes her in his arms.)<br>
BENNETT: Why did you come? You shouldn't have
come. I mean, you never listen to anyone. It drives me
mad.
<br>
O'DONNELL: To keep an eye on you, idiot.
So, don't die.
<br>
BENNETT: No.<br>
(O'Donnell dies. The Doctor walks up slowly.)<br>
BENNETT: Who's next on the list?
<br>
(Bennett lays O'Donnell down, takes off his glasses and stand to face
the Doctor.)<br>
BENNETT: That list your ghost was saying,
that's the order in which people are
going to die, isn't it?
I mean,
I've only just figured that out.
But you knew that all along, didn't you?
<br>
Moran, Pritchard, Prentis,
O'Donnell.
<br>
DOCTOR: I thought perhaps, because her ghost
wasn't there in the future,
like Prentis's was,
I thought maybe,
maybe it wouldn't happen. Maybe she stood a chance.
<br>
BENNETT: Yeah, but you didn't try very hard
to stop her, though, did you?
It was almost like you wanted to
test your theory.
So who's next?
<br>
DOCTOR: Clara.
<br>
BENNETT: Yeah.
Yeah. Except now you're going to do
something about it, aren't you? Yeah, because it's getting closer to
you.
You change
history to save
yourself but not to save O'Donnell.
You wouldn't save her.
<br>
DOCTOR: This isn't about saving me.
I'm a dead man walking.
I'm changing history to save Clara.

DOCTOR: However that sentence ends,
no, we can't.
Save him,
and you'll want to save O'Donnell.
You can't cheat time.
I just tried.
You can't just go back

Because you find yourself talking to

When we found out what the
ghosts were saying,
we weren't surprised because the
words, they were already inside us.
<br>
(Lunn is signing all this for Cass, of course.)<br>
CLARA: But you, you were, weren't you?
You didn't know what the
words were going to be.
<br>
LUNN: Er, no, I didn't. How did you know?
<br>
CLARA: Who was the one person who <em>didn't</em>
see the writing in the spaceship?
<br>
LUNN: Me. Cass wouldn't let me go inside.
<br>
CLARA: That's why the ghosts didn't hurt
you when they had the chance.
The message isn't inside you.
<br>
LUNN: Yes, I suppose that makes sense.
<br>
CLARA: So you can get the phone back.
<br>
LUNN: What? <br>
(Cass queries Lunn.)<br>
LUNN: She's saying I should go
and get the phone back.
<br>
CASS: No.
<br>
CLARA: Listen, listen. I need.
We, we need to be able to
contact the Doctor
and you are the only one who can do
this.
<br>
LUNN: Okay
<br>
(Cass grabs Lunn by the lapels and signs at him very fiercely while Clara checks if the coast is clear.)<br>
LUNN: No, she's right.
Neither of you can get it back.
<br>
(Cass signs again.)<br>
CLARA: What? What is it? What did she say?
<br>
LUNN: It doesn't matter.
<br>
CLARA: Please.
<br>
LUNN: She said to ask you whether
travelling with the Doctor
changed you,
or were you always happy to put
other people's lives at risk.
<br>
CLARA: He taught me
to do what has to be done.
You should get going.

I've seen the chaos you cause. The bloodshed.

How many!<br>
DOCTOR: Four that I know of. Maybe five by

Probably more since I left.
<br>
FISHER KING [OC]: My ghosts will make more ghosts.
Enough to bring an armada.
Enough to wake me from my sleep.
<br>
(Back in the future, the suspended animation chamber in the main
hangar suddenly activates. Lunn finds
the
four ghosts having a conference. They notice him and surround him. Lunn
closes his eyes and stands very still as they study him closely. When
they stand back, he opens his eyes and walks slowly on.)<br>

DOCTOR: You know, you've got
a lot in common with the Tivoleans. You'll both do anything to survive.
They'll surrender to anyone.
You will hijack other people's souls
and turn them into electromagnetic
projections.
That will to endure. That refusal to ever cease.
It's extraordinary.
And it makes a fella think. Because you know what? If all I have
to do to survive is tweak the future
a bit, what's stopping me?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. The ripple effect.
Maybe it will mean that the universe
will be ruled by cats or something,
in the future.
But the way I see it,
even a ghastly future is better than
no future at all.
You robbed those
people of their deaths, made them nothing more than
a message in a bottle.
You violated something more
important than Time.
You bent the rules of life

You stopped the Fisher King

dead for a hundred and fifty years
before we even got here.
But once I went back,
I became part of events.
But here's the thing.
The messages my ghost gave, they
weren't for you, they were for me.
That list. Everyone after you
was random, but you
being the next name, <em>that's</em> what
made me confront the Fisher King.

DOCTOR: That was me telling me to get inside
and when to set it for.
<br>
CLARA: Smart.
<br>
DOCTOR: Except that's not why I said them.
<br>
CLARA: How do you mean?
<br>
DOCTOR: I programmed my ghost to say them
because that's
what my ghost had said.
And the only reason I created
my ghost hologram in the first place
was because I saw it here.
I was reverse engineering
the narrative.
<br>
CLARA: Okay, that's still pretty smart.

I first have those ideas, Clara?
