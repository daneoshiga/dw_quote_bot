Alexandra Gardens, Cathays Park, Cardiff whilst pretending to be in Shoreditch, London. His mobile phone rings.)<br>

DANNY: Is that how we communicate now?<br>

No, no, Not while you're in the room. <br>

CLARA: Better when you're here, but maybe <br>
(She turns to look at the array of post-it notes on her bookshelves.
Some say PSI, Impossible Girl, Saibra, Vastra, Blinovitch, Robin Hood,
Lying, Dinosaur in London.)<br>
CLARA: Maybe not this. Okay &nbsp;Er. Okay, before all of that.
Before all of the stuff

CLARA: Danny, I'll never say those words
again. Not to anybody else, ever.
Those words, from me, are yours now.<br>
(Danny walks out onto the main road. Clara doesn't get a reply so after
a pause -)<br>
CLARA: So, er. That's a thing. <br>
(Just the sound of cars travelling on the road.)<br>
CLARA: Okay, Danny? Er, there's more but that's kind of the headline.
Okay, Danny, please speak to me,
This is, this is killing me.
<br>
(Still nothing.)<br>
CLARA: Danny, I love you. And you are the last person who's
ever going to hear me say that.
<br>
WOMAN [OC]:&nbsp;Hello?
Hello, is someone there?<br>
CLARA: Hello? Er, yeah. Who's this?<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WOMAN [OC]:&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I just
picked up the phone,
I'm sorry. I found it.

was crossing the road. 'I found the phone,
it must have just got thrown.&nbsp;The car, it just came out
of nowhere.<br>
<br>
<b>[Road]</b><br>
<br>
WOMAN: I'm so sorry.<br>
(The traffic is at a standstill. People have stopped to look, and the
emergency services are on their way, sirens wailing. Clara drops the
phone and runs along the street. She gets there just as the police are
taping the scene off.)<br>
<br>
ARMITAGE [OC]:&nbsp;By now, I'm sure you've heard
the rumours, and it is with great sadness that
I must confirm them to be true.
<br>
(A little shrine with photographs, notes and flowers is set up at the
park entrance.)<br>
ARMITAGE [OC]:&nbsp;I have gathered you all here
today to say that Mister Pink,&nbsp;that Danny Pink has
sadly passed away.&nbsp;I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing his family and friends our sincerest condolences. Mister
Pink was an inspiration
to all of those who knew him. A soldier, a teacher, a friend. It was no
secret that he had a
close relationship with Miss Oswald, and our thoughts and prayers are
with her too.<br>
(The Tardis is sitting on a ledge in a volcanic caldera.)<br>
<br>
<b>[Clara's kitchen]</b><br>
<br>
(Full
of Calla lilies and sympathy cards. Her phone is ringing, and continues
to ring throughout the scene. Caller ID says it is The Doctor calling.
Clara's gran walks in.)<br>
GRAN: Hello, love. You all right? Oh, of course you're not. Sorry. Of
course
you're not all right.
You know what you should do? You should cry. Let go.<br>
CLARA: Of what?<br>
GRAN: It's a terrible thing. Just a
terrible, terrible thing.
<br>
CLARA: It wasn't terrible.<br>
GRAN: Clara?<br>
CLARA: It was boring.<br>
GRAN: Boring?<br>
CLARA: It was ordinary.&nbsp;People just kept walking with
their iPods and their shopping bags.
He was alive, and then he was dead
and it was nothing.
Like stepping off a bus.<br>
GRAN: He deserved better. And so did you.<br>
CLARA: I don't deserve anything.
Nobody deserves anything.
But I am owed better. I am owed.<br>
GRAN: Who owes you?<br>
DOCTOR [OC]:&nbsp;Clara!&nbsp;Clara?<br>
(Clara picks up the phone and puts on a cheerful face. So, she was
actually calling him?)<br>
CLARA: Hey!<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]</b><br>
<br>
(The Doctor enters.)<br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, I was busy. What's happening?<br>
<br>
<b>[Clara's kitchen]</b><br>
<br>
CLARA: Oh, nothing. You know, same old,
same old.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]</b><br>
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, you're only human.<br>
<br>
<b>[Clara's kitchen]</b><br>
<br>
DOCTOR [OC]:&nbsp;So what I can do for you, Clara?<br>
<br>
<b>[Cauldera]</b><br>
<br>
(The
Doctor is lying outside the Tardis as the volcano spits lava and lumps
of rock. He wakes with a start to see Clara standing in the smoke by
the edge of the ledge.)<br>
DOCTOR: Clara?<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]</b><br>
<br>
(Clara enters. The Doctor is working on a piece of machinery.)<br>
CLARA: Start her up. <br>
DOCTOR: Where are we going?
<br>
CLARA: Away.
<br>
DOCTOR: From? <br>
CLARA: Just away.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, normally you say work or
kids or dishes or dullness.
So what's happened?<br>
(Clara goes downstairs to his workbench, takes a key from a round box
and puts it in her coat pocket.)<br>
CLARA: A volcano. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?
<br>
CLARA: I've never seen an active
volcano, do you know one?
<br>
DOCTOR: What's so great about
seeing a volcano?
It's just a sort of leaky mountain.
<br>
CLARA: I've never seen lava.
<br>
(She takes something out of his coat pocket and puts it into hers.)<br>
DOCTOR: It's rubbish.<br>
CLARA: Prove it.<br>
<br>
<b>[Cauldera]</b><br>
<br>
CLARA: It's on your neck.<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]<br>
<br>
</b>(In flight. Clara finds another key hidden inside The
Time Traveller's Wife. Good book, interesting concept.)<br>
CLARA: Do you still have those
sleep patch things?
<br>
DOCTOR: You can't have one.
<br>
CLARA: I'm having trouble sleeping.
<br>
DOCTOR: You still can't have one.
<br>
CLARA: Can I have one?
<br>
DOCTOR: No, you can't have one.<br>
(So Clara takes the box of them from a small set of drawers.)<br>
DOCTOR: So, volcano. What's so good about lava?<br>
(Clara puts one of the patches on the back of the Doctor's neck.)<br>
<br>
<b>[Cauldera]</b><br>
<br>
(Clara is holding out her hand.)<br>
CLARA: You told me once what it would
take to destroy a Tardis key.
That's what's so good about lava. All seven. From all of
your hiding places.
<br>
(She holds one up.)<br>
DOCTOR: Clara, what are you doing? Don't. Be very, very careful with
that. Those are very, very <br>
(She throws it backwards into the lava.)<br>
CLARA: Do I have your attention?<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
CLARA: Good.
<br>
DOCTOR: No. Not good, Clara.<br>
CLARA: Danny Pink.<br>
DOCTOR: Yeah?<br>
CLARA: Is dead.<br>
DOCTOR: And?<br>
CLARA: Seriously? <br>
DOCTOR: And?
<br>
CLARA: And fix it. Change it. Change what happened. Save him. Bring him
back.<br>
(She holds up another key and we all remember what happened in Father's
Day.)<br>
DOCTOR: No.<br>
(She throws the key away.)<br>
CLARA: Five left. Every time you say no to me, I will
throw another key down there.
Do we understand each other?<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I understand you. Let's not get carried away.
<br>
CLARA: Time can be rewritten.<br>
DOCTOR: With precision. With great care. And not today. But you know
that of course, otherwise you wouldn't
be threatening me.
<br>
CLARA: Did you just say no?<br>
DOCTOR: If I change the events
that brought you here,
you will never come here and
ask me to change those events.
Paradox loop. The timeline disintegrates.
Your timeline. And yes!
<br>
CLARA: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I did just say no. Throw away the key.<br>
CLARA: I have seen you change time, I have
seen you break any rule you want.
<br>
DOCTOR: I know when I can, I know
when I can't. Throw the key.
<br>
CLARA: I know what you're doing.
You're trying to take control.
<br>
DOCTOR: I am in control. Throw away the key. Do as you are told. <br>
CLARA: No!
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, either you do as you're told
or stop threatening me.
There really isn't
a third option here.
<br>
CLARA: Do you know what, Doctor? When it comes to taking control, you
really are out of your depth.<br>
(She throws all the remaining keys bar one into the lava.)<br>
CLARA: One last chance. And I don't care about the rules, I don't give
a damn about paradoxes. Save Danny. Bring him back
or I swear you will never step inside
your Tardis again.
<br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
CLARA: Do as you are told.
<br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
CLARA: Say it again so I know
you mean it. <br>
DOCTOR: No!
<br>
CLARA: I'm not kidding, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Neither am I. <br>
CLARA: I will do it!
<br>
DOCTOR: Clara, my Clara,
I don't think you will!
<br>
(The last key goes into the lava.)<br>
CLARA: Oh, I'd say I'm sorry
but I'd do it again.
<br>
(Clara falls to her knees and cries.)<br>
CLARA: I'd do it again. Well, what are you doing?
Why are you just standing there?
Do you understand
what I have just done?
<br>
DOCTOR: Look in your hand.
<br>
CLARA: There's nothing in my hand.
<br>
DOCTOR: Clara, look in your hand. <br>
CLARA: The keys,
they're gone. They're down there.
They've gone.<br>
DOCTOR: Clara, look in your hand.
<br>
CLARA: There's nothing in my hand.
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, there is. Look.<br>
(The sleep patch is in the middle of Clara's palm.)<br>
DOCTOR: Did you seriously think that
that was going to work on me?
<br>
(And back into the Tardis, to when Clara put the patch on the
Doctor's neck. He grabs her hand and neatly presses the patch into her
palm instead.)<br>
DOCTOR: They're not sleep patches. They induce a dream state. <br>
(He removes the patch from her palm.)<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]</b><br>
<br>
DOCTOR: Makes you very suggestible.<br>
(He picks up the Tardis keys from the floor.)<br>
DOCTOR: I allowed the whole scenario
to play out just as you planned.
I was curious about how far
you would go.
<br>
CLARA: Well, now you know.
<br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Now I know.<br>
CLARA:I love him.<br>
(The Doctor scans her with the sonic screwdriver.)<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite the mess
of chemicals, aren't you?
<br>
CLARA: So, what now? What do we do now? You and me,
what happens now?
Doctor?<br>
DOCTOR: Go to hell.<br>
(The Tardis lands.)<br>
CLARA: Fair enough. Absolutely fair enough.<br>
(She walks to the door.)<br>
DOCTOR: Clara? You asked me what we're going to do.
I told you.
We're going to hell. Or wherever it is people go
when they die. If there is anywhere.
Wherever it is, we're going to go
there and we're going to find Danny.
And if it is in any way possible,
we're going to bring him home.
Almost every culture in the universe
has some concept of an afterlife.
I always meant to have a look
around, see if I could find one.
<br>
CLARA: You're going to help me?
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, why wouldn't I help you?
<br>
CLARA: Because of what I just did. I just <br>
DOCTOR: You betrayed me.
Betrayed my trust,
you betrayed our friendship,
you betrayed everything that I've
ever stood for. You let me down!
<br>
CLARA: Then why are you helping me?<br>
DOCTOR: Why? Do you think I care for you
so little that betraying me
would make a difference? Stop it with the eyes.
Don't do that with the eyes.
How do you do that anyway?
It's like they inflate.
Cut out the whining
while you're at it.
We've got work to do. This is it,
Clara, one of those moments.
<br>
CLARA: What moments? <br>
DOCTOR: The darkest day.
The blackest hour. Chin up, shoulders back.
Let's see what we're made of,
you and I. Switching off the safeguards,
turning off the nav-com.
Remember, we did this before. We plugged you into the
Tardis telepathic interface.
<br>
CLARA: We ended up all over
Danny's timestream.
<br>
DOCTOR: Because you and he are linked. Strongly linked.
Your timestreams are intertwined. So if he's anywhere at all, that
link will hold. Give me your hands.
<br>
CLARA: Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: We're in a hurry.
<br>
CLARA: I don't deserve a friend like you.<br>
DOCTOR: Clara, I'm terribly sorry, but
I'm exactly what you deserve.
<br>
(He puts her hands into the orange gloop part of the console.)<br>
DOCTOR: Think about Danny. Think about
the man you lost.
Let it hurt. Let it burn.
But don't bleat.
Don't ask, why him? Why me? Forget
all that. Ask one question.
Just one. Ask, where is Danny Pink now?
Where is he now?
<br>
(And after a few moments, the time rotor starts up.)<br>
DOCTOR: Well, the Tardis thinks he's somewhere.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Danny is sitting
at a desk with his head resting on his hand. It slips and he wakes.
Somewhere a phone rings, and it sounds like a busy office outside. He
looks around at a set of in-trays, pens in holders, and a name plate on
the desk which says - Nethersphere After Death Department
&nbsp;SEB.
The company logo is a very large circle with a small one attached at
seven o'clock. The door opens.)<br>
SEB: Has anyone offered you a coffee?<br>
DANNY: Um.&nbsp; Well, no.<br>
SEB: Could we have some coffee
along here, please?
The good kind. We've got a new one. <br>
(Seb shuts the door and sits at his desk.)<br>
SEB: Five minutes, tops. Best to wait
for the good coffee.
<br>
DANNY: Where am I? <br>
SEB: Sometimes it's
just the instant. <br>
(Seb pulls a 'nasty taste' face.)<br>
DANNY: Where am I?<br>
SEB: Well, big question. Try to take that one slowly. We have been
trying
to contact family members,
but really there is so much admin <br>
DANNY: I wasn't here, I was <br>
SEB: Yeah. That last thing
that happened to you,
that really happened, I'm afraid. But that's life. Well, not life, I
suppose, but. There are some forms to fill in.
Might help you relax.
<br>
Well, they won't, but we do
need them filled in.
Right, important thing.
Need to know.
Are you being cremated? Sorry, it's a fairly
urgent question.
<br>
DANNY: I don't know. I've never really
thought of that.
<br>
SEB: I'm going to put you down
as a yes,
that's pretty much
the default these days.
If people only knew. <br>
DANNY: Only knew what? <br>
(Seb rolls his chair back to the door and shouts through the wall.)<br>
SEB: We've got a burner in number twelve. Tell them to prep, please.
<br>
DANNY: Burner?
<br>
(Seb rolls back to the deck.)<br>
SEB: Yeah, it's fine, we'll come to that.<br>
DANNY: But I don't understand where I am.<br>
(Seb
looks at the large pair of curtains covering one wall. Danny gets up
and opens them, then gasps. He is looking out of a round window at a
host of buildings which appear to be on the inside of a small Dyson
Sphere.)<br>
SEB: Oh, look at that.
You can see my house from here.
Yeah, sorry, probably not helping.<br>
DANNY: Where am I? Er.<br>
SEB:&nbsp; You sort of know, don't you? Most people kind of know,
it's just
hard to get traction on the concept.
<br>
DANNY: Where am I?<br>
SEB: Okay. You're dead, and this is what's next.<br>
DANNY: I'm not dead. How can I be dead?
<br>
SEB: Our sincere condolences.
<br>
DANNY: I'm standing right here.
<br>
SEB: Yes, you are.
Welcome to the Underworld. Otherwise known as the Nethersphere,
or the Promised Land.
It's where you go when you die.<br>

CLARA: Where are we?<br>
DOCTOR: Nav-com's offline. We'll have
to do this old school.
<br>
CLARA: But this is where Danny is?<br>
DOCTOR: Almost certainly not. It's where
there's a connection with Danny.
According to the Tardis, this is
where it's most likely that
your timeline will re-intersect
with his. And that won't do.
<br>
CLARA: What won't? <br>
DOCTOR: You won't. Look at you.
I need sceptical, clever, critical.
I don't need mopey.
It put years on your face.
And what if people see us together?
It looks like you've been melted.

Tardis has parked herself between two of four columns at the bottom of
a set of steps leading up to a large urn on a plinth, which has an
eternal flame burning in it. The place is dark, and the Doctor shines a
torch on an small obelisk with the Company logo on it in gold and the
words Rest In Peace, We Promise carved into the granite. They look up
at ranks and ranks of glass fronted cubicles on three sides of this marble edifice. There is the sound of
water nearby.)<br>

DOCTOR: In a mausoleum? <br>

motto on it.)<br>

actually drown in there.
<br>
DOCTOR: No. They were placed, after death. These are tombs. Water
tombs, some sort of
fluid, anyway.

CLARA: With chairs? <br>
DOCTOR: With chairs, yes.
Extra comfort for the deceased. It pays to die rich.

on.)<br>
CLARA: Oh, God. Am I going to find Danny now? Is
that why the Tardis brought us here?
I don't want to see him like that.

DOCTOR: Good point.
Tombs with windows. Who wants to
watch their loved ones rot?
Why would anyone go to
so much trouble just to keep watch on the dead?<br>
(As
they walk on, a skeleton turns its head to watch them. The Doctor finds
a small book on a lecturn. He opens his fingers across a blank page and
a cube rises up out of it. He pushes it into the corridor and opens it.
It displays that two ring logo with 3W inside it while Bach's Air on a
G String plays softly. A voice speaks the words that then scroll down.)<br>
MISSY [OC]: 3W. Death is not an end. But we can we help with
that.&nbsp;Ever since 3W encountered the truth
about the death experience,
'we have been working hard to find
a better life for the deceased.&nbsp;At 3W, afterlife means
aftercare. <br>
CLARA: Okay. Bit strange?<br>
DOCTOR: Very. Why have the scrolling and a voice? Is it difficult?<br>
CLARA: Is what difficult?<br>
DOCTOR: Reading all those words
back to front.
Come on. We've come a long way.<br>
(Missy walks through the logo, which disappears.) <br>
MISSY: Hello. I hope you're well. How may I assist you with your death?<br>

no immediate hurry.

at the Doctor, pushing him against the wall then kissing him very
intently. The Doctor's eyes bulge and he grabs the wall. Missy finishes
by kissing the tip of his nose three times, then she steps back.)<br>

CLARA [OC]: I'll do anything, Danny, anything. Just say something
only you could say.

DANNY: Clara, you have your life.
You have your whole life to live.
You have to stay there.<br>
CLARA [OC]: No. I have to be with Danny Pink.<br>
DANNY: I love you.<br>

CLARA [OC]:&nbsp;Yes?<br>
DANNY: I love you. <br>
(Clara turns off Chang's computer. Danny sits down and cries. Seb takes
back the tablet and calls up another app.)<br>
SEB: These emotions, they're terribly difficult. But, you know, we've
got a thing
for that.
We can help with all
these difficult feelings.
Just press this. <br>
(On the screen, next to the name Danny Pink, is a button marked Delete.)<br>
SEB: I'll leave you to make a decision.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Clara turns around to see the Cyberman who,
according to the name plaque, is Dr Skarosa. She runs to the door.)<br>
CLARA: Doctor! <br>
(The doors to the now empty tanks swing open. Shame, I was hoping
they'd smash their way out like they did from their <a href="5-1.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
Tomb.</a> The Cybermen
step out and stomp away.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor runs down the steps towards the river.)<br>
DOCTOR: Get away from here!
All of you, run!
<br>
(The Cybermen stomp out of the Cathedral. Ah, memories of <a href="6-3.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Invasion</a>.)<br>
DOCTOR: Go! Go! Get away from here!
Run away!
&nbsp;Run, run! Get away from here
all of you, now!
<br>
MISSY: I'm sorry, everyone. Another ranting
Scotsman in the street.
I had no idea there was a match on.
<br>
DOCTOR: Get away, go!
<br>
MISSY: Stop shouting, love. Stop making
a fuss. It's too late.
All the graves of planet Earth
are about to give birth.
You know the key strategic
weakness of the human race?
The dead outnumber the living.<br>
DOCTOR: Who are you?<br>
MISSY: Oh, you know who I am. I'm Missy.<br>
DOCTOR: Who's Missy?<br>
MISSY: Please, try to keep up. Short for Mistress. Well, I couldn't
very well keep calling myself the Master, now could I?<br>
(The Doctor backs away, horrified. The Cybermen continue their march.
Danny sobs then pulls his finger away from the Delete button.)<br>
