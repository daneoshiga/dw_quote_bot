<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (England, 1842. A large hedged area in a suburb,
with one big tree and lots of snow on the ground. The other children
throw snowballs whilst a lone boy builds a snowman.) <br>
WOMAN: Walter, don't you want to go and play with the other boys and
girls? They're very nice. <br>
WALTER: I don't need anyone else. <br>
(A man comes up to her.) <br>
WOMAN: He never talks to anyone. He's so alone. It's not right. It's
not healthy. <br>
(The man and woman walk back inside a large building.) <br>
WALTER: I don't want to talk to them. They're silly. <br>
SNOWMAN: They're silly. Don't talk to them. They're silly. <br>
(Walter runs away from the snowman.) <br>
SNOWMAN: Don't need anyone else. I can help you. <br>
WALTER: How? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(50 years later. The young boy is now a sour old
man watching men scraping bits of snow off snowmen with nasty toothy
grins and into Kilner clip-top jars. He transports the jars back to the
GI Institute and goes into a laboratory. There is a large globe on legs
three steps up on a dais, which also contains some snow. Electricity
crackles around the place.) <br>
SIMEON: The last of the arrivals have been sampled. <br>
SNOWMAN: The great swarm is approaching. As humanity celebrates, so
shall it end. Will the final piece be ready? <br>
SIMEON: It's in hand. I serve you in this, as in everything else. <br>
(Walter Simeon spoons the snow from the jars into the globe.) <br>
SNOWMAN: And do you keep my secrets, those men who helped us tonight? <br>
SIMEON: It won't be a problem. I promised to feed them. </font></p>

full of men.) <br>
WORKER: Beg pardon, Doctor Simeon. It's been a long day. I don't see
any food here. <br>
SIMEON: I do. <br>
(Toothy snowmen rear up from the ground.)&nbsp;<br>
WORKER: What is this? <br>
SIMEON: I said I'd feed you. I didn't say who to. </font></p>

tankards from the tables and takes the tray outside. There is a toothy
snowman in the yard between the inn and the wash house. A man walks
past her.) <br>
CLARA: Did you make this snowman? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
CLARA: Well, who did? Because it wasn't there a second ago. It just
appeared, from nowhere. <br>
(The Doctor turns and comes back to examine it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe it's snow that fell before. Maybe it remembers how to
make snowmen. <br>
CLARA: What, snow that can remember? That's silly. <br>
DOCTOR: What's wrong with silly? <br>
CLARA: Nothing. Still talking to you, ain't I? <br>
DOCTOR: What's your name? <br>
CLARA: Clara. <br>
DOCTOR: Nice name. Clara. You should definitely keep it. Goodbye! <br>
(Clara follows him around the corner.) <br>
CLARA: Oi! Where are you going? I thought we was just getting
acquainted. <br>
Those were the days. <br>
(The Doctor leaves. Clara starts to return to the inn, then changes her
mind and runs after his brougham carriage. It's not a hansom because
the driver is in front, not behind.) </font></p>

greeted at the door by a servant.) <br>
ALICE: Good evening, sir. <br>
LATIMER: Pond's frozen over. Hasn't frozen since the night <br>
SIMEON: Since the night your children's governess died, a year ago. <br>
ALICE: Doctor Simeon, sir. He insisted on waiting. <br>
LATIMER: She drowned in this very pond. <br>
SIMEON: Which then froze. You didn't find her till a month later, when
the ice finally melted. <br>
LATIMER: I recall the incident. It is the sort of thing one remembers. <br>
SIMEON: The ice remembers too. <br>
LATIMER: Who are you? What do you want here? <br>

SIMEON: The pond is yours, Captain Latimer, but what is growing inside
it, when it is ready, is ours. Good evening. </font></p>

in Simeon's path.) <br>
JENNY: Well, Doctor Simeon, you're out very late tonight. <br>
VASTRA: Almost makes you wonder what you've been up to. But then, I
have often wondered about the activities of Doctor Simeon and his
exceptionally secretive Institute. <br>
SIMEON: Well, I am honoured this evening. The veiled detective and her
fatuous accomplice. <br>
JENNY: At your service. <br>
SIMEON: You realise Doctor Doyle is almost certainly basing his
fantastical tales on your own exploits? With a few choice alterations,
of course.
I doubt the readers of The Strand magazine would accept that the great
detective is, in reality a woman. <br>
(Simeon lifts Vastra's veil to reveal that she is a Silurian.) <br>
SIMEON: And her suspiciously intimate companion <br>
VASTRA: I resent your implication of impropriety. We are married. <br>
JENNY: More than can be said for you, eh, dear? <br>
VASTRA: Now then. This snow is interesting, don't you think? The ice
crystals seem to have a low level telepathic field. Almost as if it can
detect and respond to the thoughts and memories of the people around
it. Memory snow. Snow that learns. <br>
SIMEON: How fascinating. <br>
VASTRA: I hope it's listening to the right people. It could be a
terrible weapon in the wrong hands, don't you think? <br>
SIMEON: I think winter is coming. Such a winter as this world has never
known. The last winter of humankind. Do you know why I'm telling you
all this? <br>
VASTRA: I am intrigued. <br>
SIMEON: Because there's not a single thing you can do to stop it. <br>
VASTRA: Perhaps I can't, but I know a man who can. <br>
SIMEON: I look forward to meeting him. <br>
(Simeon leaves.)&nbsp;<br>
JENNY: Do you mean the Doctor? He won't help us. He never helps any
more, you know that. <br>
VASTRA: Yes, my dear, I do. So pray for a miracle, because I think we
are going to need him. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Simeon is being watched by a manservant with
electronic binoculars. Nearby, the Doctor's carriage is rocking.) <br>
STRAX: They've taken samples from snowmen all over London. What do you
suppose they're doing in there? <br>
(The manservant is a Sontaran.) <br>
DOCTOR: This snow is new. Possibly alien. When you find something brand
new in the world, something you've never seen before, what's the next
thing you look for? <br>
STRAX: A grenade. <br>
DOCTOR: A profit. That's Victorian values for you. <br>
STRAX: I suggest a full frontal assault with automated laser monkeys,
scalpel mines and acid. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
STRAX: Couldn't we at least investigate? <br>
DOCTOR: It's none of our business. <br>
STRAX: Sir, permission to express my opposition to your current apathy?
<br>
DOCTOR: Permission granted. <br>
STRAX: Sir, I am opposed to your current apathy. <br>
CLARA [OC]: Let me out! <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Strax. And if ever I'm in need of advice from a
psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. <br>
STRAX: But if the snow is new and alien, shouldn't we be making some
attempt to destroy it? Be reasonable. <br>
CLARA [OC] Let me out! <br>
DOCTOR: It is not our problem. Over a thousand years of saving the
universe, Strax, you know the one thing I learned? The universe doesn't
care. <br>
CLARA [OC]: In this cab. Oi, Doctor! Let me out! Are you listening to
me? <br>
DOCTOR: Now, we have a problem of our own to worry about. <br>
CLARA [OC]: Let me out! </font></p>

DOCTOR: Don't worry. No one's going to hurt you. <br>
CLARA: What is that thing? <br>
STRAX: Silence, boy! <br>
DOCTOR: That's Strax. And as you can see, he's easily confused. <br>
STRAX: Silence, girl. Sorry, lad. <br>
DOCTOR: Sontaran. Clone warrior race. Factory produced, whole legions
at a time. Two genders is a bit further than he can count. <br>
STRAX: Sir, do not discuss my reproductive cycle in front of enemy
girls. It's embarrassing. <br>
DOCTOR: Typical middle child of six million. <br>
CLARA: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter because you're about to forget that you and I
ever met. <br>
STRAX: We'll need the worm. <br>
STRAX: Sir. <br>
CLARA: You'll need the what? The worm? What worm? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, it won't hurt, but one touch on your bare skin and
you lose the last hour of your memory. <br>
(Strax returns.) <br>
DOCTOR: Where is it? <br>
STRAX: Where's what, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: I sent you to get the memory worm. <br>
STRAX: Did you? When? Who's he? What are we doing here? Look, it's been
snowing! <br>
DOCTOR: You didn't use the gauntlets, did you? <br>
STRAX: Why would I need the gauntlets? Do you want me to get the memory
worm? <br>
DOCTOR: You. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A short time later, Strax is under the carriage.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, can you see it? <br>
STRAX: I think I can hear it. <br>
(Clara giggles.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oi, don't try to run away. Stay where you are. <br>
CLARA: Why would I run? I know what's going to happen next and it's
funny. <br>
DOCTOR: What's funny? <br>
CLARA: Well, your little pal, for a start. He's an ugly little fella,
isn't he? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe. He gave his life for a friend of mine once. <br>
CLARA: Then how come he's alive? <br>
DOCTOR: Another friend of mine brought him back. I'm not sure all his
brains made the return trip! <br>
CLARA: Neither am I. <br>
STRAX: I can see it. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo! Can you reach it? Have you got it? <br>
STRAX: Got what, sir? <br>
CLARA: Because these are the gauntlets, aren't they? <br>
STRAX: Sir, emergency! I think I've been run over by a cab. <br>
(The Doctor uses the gauntlets to get hold of a large white worm.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you go. One touch and you lose about an hour of your
memory. Let it bite you and you could lose decades. <br>
(He puts it into a jar.) <br>
DOCTOR: And you're still not trying to run. <br>
CLARA: I don't understand how the snowman built itself. I'll run once
you've explained. <br>
DOCTOR: Clara who? <br>
CLARA: Doctor who? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dangerous question. <br>
CLARA: What's wrong with dangerous? <br>
(A snowman appears.) <br>
DOCTOR: The snow emits a low level telepathic field. <br>
CLARA: My snowman. <br>
DOCTOR: It seems to reflect people's thoughts and memories and because
it's unusual, somehow it carries a previous shape and <br>
CLARA: No, Doctor. My snowman. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Interesting. Well, were you thinking about it? <br>
CLARA: Yes. <br>
(Another one appears, then others.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, stop. Clara, stop thinking about the snowmen! <br>
(The nearest snowman breaths snowflakes at them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Get down! Clara, listen to me. The snow's feeding off your
thoughts. <br>
CLARA: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: You're caught in their telepathic field. They're mirroring you.
The more you think about the snowmen, the more they appear. Imagine
them melting. Picture it. Picture them melted! <br>
(They get splashed with icy water. The snowmen are gone.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, very good. Very, very good. Ha! <br>
CLARA: Is that going to happen again? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if it does, you know what to do about it. <br>
CLARA: Unless I forget. <br>
(The Doctor puts Clara into the carriage.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't come looking for me. Forget about me. You understand? <br>
CLARA: What about the snow? Shouldn't we be warning people? <br>
DOCTOR: Not my problem. Merry Christmas. Take her back where we found
her. <br>

whistling Silent Night. Seeing that the coast is clear, he jumps up and
grabs a ladder, which he pulls down. Clara hides behind a tree whilst
the Doctor climbs the ladder and vanishes. There is a clunk, and the
ladder rises up and disappears too. After a moment, Clara comes out and
tries to jump for the ladder. She gets it on the second attempt.) <br>
CLARA: Come on. <br>
(She starts to climb. At the top of the ladder, she waves at
passers-by, but they do not see or hear her.) <br>
CLARA: Hello. Invisible. <br>

air above her.) <br>

DIGBY: She fell in there, and then it froze. She was in the ice for
days and days. I hated her. She was cross all the time. In Frannie's
dream she's still down there, waiting to come back. <br>
CLARA: Everything else has thawed, but this pond is still frozen. <br>
DOCTOR [memory]: The snow is feeding off your thoughts. The more you
think about the snowmen, the more they appear. <br>
CLARA: Frannie, this is important. You dream about her. What do you
dream? <br>
FRANCESCA: She's cross with me. She says I've been bad, and she's going
to come out of the pond and punish me. <br>

CLARA: No? <br>
VASTRA: No. The Doctor doesn't help people. Not anyone, not ever. He
stands above this world and doesn't interfere in the affairs of its
inhabitants.
He is not your salvation, nor your protector. Do you understand what I
am saying to you? <br>
CLARA: Words. <br>
VASTRA: He was different once, a long time ago. Kind, yes. A hero,
even. A saver of worlds. But he suffered losses which hurt him.
Now he prefers isolation to the possibility of pain's return. Kindly
choose a word to indicate your understanding of this. <br>
CLARA: Man. <br>
VASTRA: We are the Doctor's friends. We assist him in his isolation but
that does not mean we approve of it. So, a test for you. Give me a
message for the Doctor. Tell him all about the snow and what fresh
danger you believe it presents, and above all, explain why he should
help you. But do it in one word. You're thinking it is impossible that
such a word exists, or that you could even find it.

SNOWMAN: You are not of this world. <br>
DOCTOR: Takes one to snow one. Right, let's see. Multi-nucleate
crystalline organism with the ability to mimic and mirror what it
finds. Looks like snow. Isn't snow. <br>
SIMEON: You must leave here now. <br>
DOCTOR: Shut up, I'm making deductions. It's very exciting. Now, what
are you, eh? A flock of space crystals? A swarm? The snowmen are foot
soldiers,
mindless predators. But you, you're the clever one. You're Moriarty.
So, you turn up on a planet, you generate a telepathic field to learn
what you can,
and when you've learnt enough, what do you do? You can't conquer the
world using snowmen. Snowmen are rubbish in July. You'll have to be
better than that.
You'll have to evolve. <br>

WALTER [memory]: I don't want to talk to them. They're silly. <br>
SNOWMAN [memory]: They're silly. <br>
DOCTOR: It just reflects back everything we think and feel and fear. <br>
WALTER [memory]: I don't need anyone else. <br>
SNOWMAN [memory]: Don't need anyone else. <br>
DOCTOR: You poured your darkest dreams into a snowman and look, look
what it became. <br>
VASTRA: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a parasite feeding on the loneliness of a child and the
sickness of an old man. Carnivorous snow meets Victorian values and
something terrible is born. <br>
SNOWMAN: We can go on and do everything we planned. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, and what a plan. A world full of living ice people. Oh
dear me, how very Victorian of you. <br>
SIMEON: What's wrong with Victorian values? <br>
(Simeon grabs the lunch box and opens it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, ah, ah. Are you sure? <br>
SIMEON: I have always been sure. <br>
(The memory worm in the box bites him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you think so, since your entire adult life is
about to be erased. No parasite without a host. Without you, it will
have no voice. Without the governess, it will have no form. <br>
SNOWMAN: What, what, what's happening? What's happening? What did you
do? <br>
DOCTOR: You've got nothing left to mirror any more. Goodbye. <br>
SNOWMAN: What did you, did you. <br>
(The snow suddenly fills the globe and its voice deepens again.) <br>
SNOWMAN: Did you really think it would be so easy? <br>
DOCTOR: That's not possible. How is that possible? <br>
VASTRA: Doctor?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: But you were just Doctor Simeon. You're not
real. He dreamed you. How can you still exist? <br>
SNOWMAN: Now the dream outlives the dreamer and can never die. Once I
was the puppet. <br>
(Simeon is reanimated as an icy ghoul.) <br>
SNOWMAN: Now I pull the strings! I tried so long to take on human form.
By erasing Simeon, you made space for me. I fill him now. <br>
(Simeon knocks Vastra aside and grabs the Doctor.) <br>
SNOWMAN: More than snow, more than Simeon. Even this old body is strong
in my control. <br>
DOCTOR: Argh! <br>
SNOWMAN: Do you feel it? Winter is coming! <br>
(His touch starts to freeze the Doctor's skin.) <br>
DOCTOR: Argh! <br>

You can do it. <br>
CLARA: Captain Latimer. Your children. They're afraid. Hold them. <br>
LATIMER: It's not really my area. <br>
CLARA: It is now. <br>
(A single tear runs down from Clara's eye. Outside, thunder rends the
snowstorm and turns it into rain.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The snow globe is filled with melt water. Simeon
leaps off the Doctor.) <br>
SNOWMAN: What's happening? <br>
VASTRA: Doctor, the globe. It's turning to rain. All of it, the snow,
look. <br>
(Simeon dies.) <br>
VASTRA: He's dead. What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: The snow mirrors, that's all it does. It's mirroring something
else now. Something so strong, it's drowning everything else. <br>
(The Doctor opens a window and holds out his hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: There was a critical mass of snow at the house. If something
happened there <br>
(They both taste the rain.) <br>
VASTRA: It's salty. Salt water rain. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not raining. It's crying. The only force on Earth that
could drown the snow. A whole family crying on Christmas Eve.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis materialises.) <br>
STRAX: I'm sorry. There was nothing to be done. She has moments only. <br>
DOCTOR: We saved the world, Clara, you and me. We really, really did. <br>
CLARA: Are you going back to your cloud? <br>
DOCTOR: No more cloud. Not now. <br>
CLARA: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: It rained. <br>
CLARA: Run. Run, you clever boy. And remember. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Captain Latimer is with his children by the
graveside.) <br>
VASTRA: And what about the Intelligence? Melted with the snow? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I shouldn't think so. It learned to survive beyond physical
form. <br>
JENNY: Well, we can't be in much danger from a disembodied Intelligence
that thinks it can invade the world with snowmen. <br>
VASTRA: Or that the London Underground is a key strategic weakness. <br>
DOCTOR: The Great Intelligence. Rings a bell. The Great Intelligence. <br>
(He walks forward to the grave as the family leave.) <br>
JENNY: Doctor? <br>
(The gravestone has already been carved and put in place.) <br>
DOCTOR: I never knew her name. Her full name. <br>
OSWIN [memory]: Oswin Oswald. Junior Entertainment Manager, Starship
Alaska. <br>
DOCTOR: Soufflé girl. Oswin. It was her. <br>
OSWIN [memory]: Run, you clever boy. <br>
CLARA [memory]: Run, you clever boy. <br>
OSWIN [memory]: And remember. <br>
CLARA [memory]: And remember. <br>
DOCTOR: It was soufflé girl again. I never saw her face the first time
with the Daleks, but her voice, it was the same voice. <br>
JENNY: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: The same woman, twice. And she died both times. The same woman!
<br>
VASTRA: Doctor, please, what are you talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: Something's going on. Something impossible, something. Right,
you two stay here. Stay right here. Don't move an inch. <br>
VASTRA: Are you coming back? <br>
DOCTOR: Shouldn't think so! <br>
VASTRA: But where are you going? <br>
DOCTOR: To find her. To find Clara. Ha ha ha! <br>
JENNY: But Clara's dead. What's he talking about, finding her? <br>
(Clara Oswin Oswald. Remember me, we shall meet again. Born November 23
1866, died December 24, 1892.)&nbsp;<br>
VASTRA: I don't know, but perhaps the universe makes bargains after
all. <br>
(Same graveyard, over a hundred years later and somewhat overgrown.) <br>
GIRL [OC]: Where are you going? <br>
CLARA: Short cut. <br>
GIRL: Through there? I hate this place! Don't you think it's creepy? <br>
