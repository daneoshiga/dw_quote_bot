hole in the wall and makes an announcement.) <br>
SELRIS: Class three one nine six in the first grade. The names of the
first selected candidates are, male, Abu-Gond! The second name is
female. Vana-Gond! <br>
THARA: (a young man) No! <br>
SELRIS: Abu-Gond and Vana-Gond, alone of your generation you have been
chosen to receive the highest honour that can befall a Gond. You are
now the companions of the Krotons! Our warmest, our most sincere
congratulations to you both. You will now step forward for the
investiture of your robes of honour. Eelek. <br>
(Eelek, played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0535053/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Philip
Madoc</a>, places a silver cape on Abu's shoulder.) <br>
VANA: Please, Thara! <br>
THARA: You can't go. I won't let you go! <br>
VANA: I must! <br>
THARA: Look, Vana, we can run away. There's still time. <br>
VANA: You know that's not possible. We must always obey. <br>
THARA: Why? <br>
SELRIS: Because, my son, it is the law of the Krotons! <br>
(A hexagonal door in the wall opens, and Abu walks through, proudly.)

The Doctor, Zoe and Jamie look around at the bleak landscape.) <br>
DOCTOR: Lovely, lovely, lovely. <br>
JAMIE: Pwoar, bad eggs. Let's try somewhere else. <br>
ZOE: No, wait a minute. Where are we? <br>
JAMIE: You don't expect him to know, do you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's explore shall we? <br>
(The Doctor puts up an umbrella.) <br>
JAMIE: An umbrella? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, twin suns. It's bound to be hot. <br>
JAMIE: Oh. <br>
ZOE: I don't think I like it here. It looks dead. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, it smells dead. <br>
ZOE: Sulphur, isn't it? It could be poisonous. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, the instruments in the Tardis would have told
us. No it's a, it's a mixture of ozone and sulphur. Very bracing!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They clamber up the side of the cliff. The Doctor
picks up a flat rock.) <br>
JAMIE: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, fascinating structures. Magnesium silicate. <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
ZOE: He means mica. <br>
JAMIE: Oh. What? (They reach the top.) <br>
DOCTOR: Dead, is it? <br>
(They look down on an alien town of large buildings made of triangles.)
<br>
ZOE: Is it a city? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, fascinating architecture. It's more typical of a low
gravity planet, and yet I think this is quite normal. Yes. <br>
ZOE: Inca, perhaps? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, possibly. <br>
JAMIE [OC]: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, let's see what he's up to. Be careful. <br>
(Jamie is making his way down a scree slope.) <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, down here. <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, down here!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jamie has led them to a large metal structure in
another cliff face with a hexagonal door and ramp leading up to it.) <br>
ZOE: What is it? <br>
JAMIE: I don't know. There's a ramp here. <br>
ZOE: Yes, and there's a door as well. Is it a wall? <br>
DOCTOR: I hardly think so, Zoe. <br>
JAMIE: Phwoar, that smell's a lot stronger round here. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh this is interesting! <br>
ZOE: What, Doctor? <br>
JAMIE: Oh, metal, isn't it? <br>
ZOE: What, covered in moss and lichen? <br>
JAMIE: Well, er. <br>
DOCTOR: Metal? Would you say so? I think we'd better get away from
here. <br>
JAMIE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Come along. <br>
ZOE: But why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this isn't a building, this is a machine. Come along. <br>
JAMIE: Machine? Doctor, it's opening! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, quickly. Behind the rocks. (The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe
hide behind a convenient boulder and watch Abu totter out, somewhat
dazed but still wearing his cape. Two nozzles emerge from either side
of the door.) <br>
JAMIE: What's the matter with him? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush! <br>
(Abu is enveloped in opaque gas. He collapses, groaning. When the gas
clears, all that is left is his metal breastplate and its curled wire
necklace.) <br>
ZOE: Oh, that poor man. <br>
JAMIE: What happened to him? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. Come on, let's get away from here.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Learning Hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> THARA: Can't you give the order she doesn't have
to go? You're our leader! <br>
SELRIS: But the Krotons have chosen Vana. It is a great honour! <br>
THARA: Honour? Why do we take their orders? <br>
EELEK: Vana. <br>
THARA: We don't even know if they exist. <br>
VANA: Thara, you can't say things like that. <br>
EELEK: Get out of the way. <br>
THARA: She's not going into that machine! <br>
EELEK: She has to go in. No one defies the Krotons. <br>
THARA: All right! <br>
(Thara draws a small metal hand weapon, a metal axe.) <br>
EELEK: Now don't be so stupid! <br>
SELRIS: Thara! <br>
EELEK: Disarm him! <br>
(Thara pulls Vana behind him.) <br>
THARA: Keep back! <br>
(Meanwhile the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are coming down a stone
staircase.) <br>
ZOE: Oh, I hope they're friendly. <br>
DOCTOR: Now just leave this to me, Zoe. <br>
(The Doctor steps down into the hall.) <br>
DOCTOR: We are friends! <br>
(Wicked looking spears are pointed at his throat.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. Now don't be afraid. <br>
JAMIE: We have trouble. <br>
AXUS: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: But, but, one of your people has been <br>
AXUS: You're strangers. Where are you from? <br>
ZOE: Well, if we told you it wouldn't mean anything. <br>
AXUS: Answer me. Where are you from? <br>
DOCTOR: There's no time for explanations! As I say, one of your people
has been <br>
AXUS: They're not Gonds! Their clothes, the way they're dressed. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, we are friendly. <br>
JAMIE: Look, are you going to let us pass or not? <br>
ZOE: Doctor! Look. <br>
EELEK: Do something about him. He's your son. <br>
THARA: I'm warning you. One step nearer. <br>
SELRIS: Thara, will you be reasonable? The Krotons have sent for Vana. <br>
THARA: She'd not going. Nobody comes back from there! <br>
VANA: Let me go, Thara. Please. I don't want them to hurt you. (With a
spear point at his throat, Thara throws down his weapon. Vana steps
forward to Eelek, who puts a curly necklace with a breastplate attached
around Vana's neck.) <br>
EELEK: A bit of sense, just in time. <br>
ZOE: That doorway. It's like the other one. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, and she's wearing a cloak just like that chap we saw
killed. <br>
ZOE: Is she being sacrificed? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so, Zoe. They're too civilised for that. <br>
JAMIE: Can we not stop them? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we can try. Just a minute. Wait! <br>
AXUS: They're interrupting the ceremony! Take them! <br>
JAMIE: Now just. (guards grab them) Aye, you wouldn't be so tough
without these guards round you. <br>
AXUS: Get back. I accept your challenge. <br>
JAMIE: Oh you do, do you? Aye, well, that's just fine with me then. <br>
DOCTOR: Now Jamie, don't be so rash. <br>
JAMIE: Ah don't worry, Doctor. I'll see to this laddie. <br>
(A guard offers Jamie an axe.) <br>
JAMIE: No, I'll not be needing that, thank you. <br>
ZOE: Oh, Jamie, watch out! <br>
(Axus swings his axe and Jamie dodges easily.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie! <br>
(Axus grabs Jamie's arm and they come in close for a trial of
strength.) <br>
ZOE: Oh Doctor! Oh, can't we stop them? Oh, Jamie. <br>
(The axe moves closes to Jamie's head.) <br>
ZOE: Oh Jamie, come on! <br>
(Jamie forces Axus' arm back over his shoulder and he drops the axe
before falling to the floor clutching his wrist. Jamie rejoins the
Doctor and Zoe.) <br>
ZOE: Doctor, look. The girl! <br>
(Vana looks back at Thara then walks through the doorway.) <br>
SELRIS: What is happening? Who are these people?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: That was the very question I was going to ask you! What is
happening here? Where has that girl gone? <br>
AXUS: Eelek, they forced their way through! <br>
SELRIS: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: There is no time to explain! <br>
JAMIE: Look, you wouldn't believe us even if we told you. <br>
ZOE: We're from another planet, another world. <br>
DOCTOR: That girl. Now where has she gone? <br>
SELRIS: How can they be from another planet? <br>
JAMIE: Och, look, we're just wasting time. Now where has she gone? <br>
DOCTOR: What's behind that wall? <br>
THARA: The Krotons. They've sent her to join the Krotons. <br>
ZOE: Well, what are the Krotons? <br>
THARA: The Krotons live in the machine, so we're told. <br>
SELRIS: Vana is joining the Krotons. It is a great honour. <br>
THARA: Honour? She didn't want to go. Nobody really wants to disappear
into that thing. <br>
(The Doctor takes a closer look at the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: How do you open this door? <br>
EELEK: Why are you asking so many questions? <br>
DOCTOR: Because a moment ago we saw a young man dressed in a silver
robe just like that girl. We saw him killed! <br>
SELRIS: Abu-Gond? <br>
EELEK: That's ridiculous. How can these people have seen Abu-Gond? <br>
SELRIS: He's with the Krotons. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, well, we saw someone killed anyway. He came out of that
machine and was <br>
ZOE: Vapourised. <br>
JAMIE: Aye. Right round the other side. <br>
AXUS: Other side? <br>
SELRIS: You have been in the wasteland. <br>
EELEK: They're contaminated. You're contaminated. No one goes into the
wasteland. <br>
ZOE: Why not? <br>
EELEK: Because it's poisoned, and you will die. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it may have been poisoned once, but I can assure you it's
quite safe now. <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, that girl. If she comes out that way. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, you're right. We must save her! <br>
JAMIE: I know! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, come on! <br>
JAMIE: That's what I'm saying! <br>
SELRIS: Where are you going? <br>
ZOE: To the wasteland! <br>
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe run out.) <br>
SELRIS: But you can't. It's against the law of the Krotons! <br>
THARA: I'm going with them! <br>
SELRIS: Thara, come back!&nbsp;<br>
THARA: If they can go into the wasteland, I can. <br>
SELRIS: Thara! You'll die!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JAMIE: There it is. <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder how long. I imagine we haven't much time. <br>
ZOE: What are you going to do? <br>
(The Doctor picks up a piece of mica.) <br>
DOCTOR: You keep away, Zoe. Keep right away. <br>
THARA: Can I help? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Mister? <br>
THARA: Thara. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well you can find some more stones like this. <br>
THARA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you want to help! Now then. <br>
(The Doctor uses his umbrella to force the stone into the right hand
nozzle.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that one. <br>
(The Doctor takes a stone from Thara and forces it into the other
nozzle.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right! Come down here. <br>
(The group hides. The door opens.) <br>
ZOE: Doctor, I think I can hear something. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes Zoe, so can I. <br>
(Vana stumbles out of the doorway.) <br>
THARA: Vana! <br>
JAMIE: Keep down! <br>
(The Doctor runs forward to catch Vana, with his open umbrella
shielding them from the door nozzles.) <br>
ZOE: Oh Doctor, quick! <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, look out! <br>
ZOE: Oh Doctor, hurry! <br>
JAMIE: Quick! <br>
(The Doctor carries Vana to their hiding place. The stones are finally
pushed from the nozzles and the deadly gas is expelled onto empty air.)
<br>
THARA: What's happened? What have they done to her? <br>
(Some of the gas has caught the umbrella, and ruined it.) <br>
DOCTOR: The vandals. Look at that. <br>
ZOE: That could have happened to you! <br>
DOCTOR: My favourite umbrella. <br>
THARA: She doesn't know me. She can't speak or anything. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, it's something that those Krotons have done to her. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me see. Oh dear, this is almost catatonic. ZOE: Isn't there
anything you can do? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not a Doctor of medicine you know, Zoe. However, if there's
no damage to the tissue. Is there anywhere we can take her? <br>
THARA: My father's house is quite near, on the edge of the community. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's take her there. Give me a hand. Come on, Jamie.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A simple wattle and daub place with a curtain for
a door. Selris gives Zoe a clay beaker and she takes a small sip.) <br>
SELRIS: It's almost impossible to believe. The Krotons have always been
our good friends. Our benefactors. <br>
ZOE: Well, you've only got to see what they've done to Vana. <br>
SELRIS: Yes, poor child. <br>
JAMIE: How is she? <br>
THARA: Just the same. <br>
(Thara leaves.) <br>
(The Doctor is swinging his pocket watch in front of Vana's eyes.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're resting. You're calmly resting. Your mind is quite
empty. You're resting. Now, you're going to sleep, Vana. Sleep. Feeling
sleepy. Very sleepy. Sleep. <br>
(Vana's eyes close.) <br>
SELRIS: You see, every so often the two best of our students have
entered the machine to join the Krotons. They can't all have been
murdered. <br>
ZOE: Well, it's possible. If they had you wouldn't know because this
spray stuff just <br>
JAMIE: Dissolves everything. In any case, none of your people ever go
into the wasteland. <br>
SELRIS: But why should they do it? Why should they kill the best of our
students? <br>
ZOE: What are they like, these Krotons? <br>
SELRIS: No living person has ever seen them. They never come out of the
machine. <br>
ZOE: Never? <br>
SELRIS: Not since the beginning. Not for thousands of years. <br>
ZOE: How is she? <br>
DOCTOR: She's asleep at last. <br>
JAMIE: Is she going to be all right, though? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so, Jamie. It's difficult to tell. <br>
(Selris hands the Doctor a beaker.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
SELRIS: And she was one of the finest students we've ever produced. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh really? Competition for you, Zoe. <br>
ZOE: Selris was just saying that no one's ever seen these Krotons. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, they never leave that machine. <br>
DOCTOR: How did all this begin, Selris? <br>
SELRIS: According to our legends, silver men came out of the sky and
built a house among us. The Gonds attacked them but the silver men
caused a poisonous rain to fall, killing hundreds of our people and
turning the earth black. <br>
JAMIE: The wasteland. <br>
SELRIS: Yes. Because it was said that ever afterwards anyone who set
foot there would die in terrible pain.

CUSTODIAN: Who are you? What do you want? Leave me alone! <br>
THARA: The Krotons. You must know a lot about them. <br>
CUSTODIAN: What do you mean? <br>
STUDENT: You're their servant, aren't you? You work for them. <br>
CUSTODIAN: I am only the Custodian of the Learning Hall. <br>
THARA: Of course. So you can tell us what we want to know. <br>
CUSTODIAN: I am forbidden to discuss the secrets. <br>
STUDENT: We only want to know how to get at them. <br>
THARA: We want to see the Krotons for ourselves. <br>
CUSTODIAN: Nobody has seen the Krotons, not for thousands of years. <br>
THARA: You're sure they don't come out of the machine in the darkness
when there's no one here? <br>
CUSTODIAN: No. Come out? Never! <br>
THARA: Then how do they give their orders? Answer me! <br>
CUSTODIAN: There are messages. You must know that. <br>
THARA: What else? <br>
CUSTODIAN: Sometimes there is a voice. <br>
THARA: But you've never seen them? There's no way you can get inside
there? <br>
CUSTODIAN: Only the companions of the Krotons may enter. <br>
THARA: And now we know what happens to them. But you can summon the
Krotons, can't you? <br>
CUSTODIAN: It is not for me to summon them. I obey their commands. <br>
THARA: If we can't get in there, then we must fetch them out. Their
precious teaching machines. Smash them! <br>
CUSTODIAN: Smash the machines? Guards! <br>
(The boys put their hands over his mouth, and the Student threatens
with his axe.) <br>
THARA: Do not hurt him! Tie his hands and gag him. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JAMIE: But what happened after this war with the
Krotons? <br>
SELRIS: Ever since, we have lived in peace with them. The Krotons never
show themselves to us, but we learn from them through the teaching
machines. <br>
ZOE: Teaching machines? <br>
SELRIS: Yes, in the Hall of Learning, where you were today. The
machines fill the mind with knowledge. <br>
DOCTOR: And everyone uses these machines? <br>
SELRIS: When they are young, yes. That is the law. <br>
DOCTOR: Whose law, Selris? <br>
SELRIS: Our law. The Gonds'. <br>
DOCTOR: But I thought you said all your laws were given you by the
Krotons? <br>
SELRIS: Yes, all our science, all our culture, everything we have, has
come from the machine. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. A sort of self-perpetuating slavery. And the Krotons
always choose your two most promising students? <br>
SELRIS: To be their companions, yes. Do you think they've all been
killed? <br>
JAMIE: Aye, well, we saw one of them killed anyway. <br>
ZOE: Well why are they doing it, Doctor? What's the point? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well, it's time it was stopped, anyway. It's high time it
was stopped. <br>
SELRIS: What shall I tell my people? How can I explain? <br>
JAMIE: Explain what? Just tell the truth. <br>
SELRIS: What, that they've been tricked? That for thousands of years
the best of our students have been dying, murdered by the Krotons? <br>
ZOE: Well, what are you afraid of? <br>
DOCTOR: Another war between your people and the Krotons, you mean. <br>
SELRIS: Yes. There could be terrible bloodshed. Another wasteland here
in our community. <br>

BETA: Selris. <br>
SELRIS: Ah, Beta. Come and meet our guests. My friends, this is Beta,
our controller of Science and my son's good friend. <br>
BETA: That's what I'm here for. Do you know what Thara's planning? <br>
SELRIS: Planning? <br>
BETA: He and some students gone out to the Learning Hall. They're going
to wreck the machines. <br>
SELRIS: No! <br>
BETA: You've got to stop them, Selris. I came as quickly as I could,
but they'll be there by now. <br>
SELRIS: Then it's too late! <br>
DOCTOR: Not if we cut through the wasteland. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, it's the shortest route. <br>
SELRIS: The wasteland? <br>
BETA: But the poison? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that wore off a long time ago. It's quite safe now. <br>

DOCTOR: Stop it. Stop it, all of you! Listen to me. This will do no
good at all. These Krotons must have enormous scientific powers. You
can't defeat them with axes! <br>

top moves across to another monitor where a pixilated image of the
Doctor appears.) <br>

THARA: An atomic-laser? Is that better than an axe? <br>
SELRIS: Look at the damage you've done. Completely senseless. <br>

it? <br>

probe is about to strike. Everyone scatters. A student tries to sneak
up behind the probe with an axe, and gets a dose of the disintegrating

retreats back through its hole in the wall.) <br>

them. <br>

you will help us? <br>

us to study. Fluids which eat away metal and flesh. In time I can
develop some way of attacking them. <br>
