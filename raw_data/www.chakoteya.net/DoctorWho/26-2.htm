<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In an Victorian household, a small lift takes the
housekeeper and maid up to a part of the house which is kept secluded.
They walk along a short round tunnel to an open area with a table in
the middle. Curtains are around the walls apart from a closed door at
the far end where the housekeeper speaks through a panel. Everyone say
Hi! to the excellent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0843401/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sylvia
Sims</a>.) <br>
PRITCHARD: I've brought you your dinner and your copy of the Times. <br>
(The maid puts the dinner tray on the floor while Mrs Pritchard uses a
stick to lift another panel at the bottom of the door, then the maid
quickly pushes the tray through and backs away. In the room something
howls.)

front door bell. She lets in a clerical gentleman with long sideburns.)
<br>
MATTHEWS: Tell your Master that the Reverend Ernest Matthews has
arrived. Well? This house is Gabriel Chase, is it not? <br>
GROSE: Yes sir, but, excuse me sir, as I understood it, you would not
be arriving until this evening. <br>
MATTHEWS: Madam, my patience has already been sorely tried by the
interminable journey from Oxford. <br>
<i> GROSE: Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. But you see, well, we
don't get many visitors, you see. <br>
MATTHEW: Apparently not. Now kindly inform Mister Smith, if he is at
home, that I have answered his summons and am waiting. <br>
GROSE: Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. This way, sir. </i> </font></p>

<br>
ACE [OC]: Professor, thirty second penalty. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Just get on with it. It's all part of the initiative test.
<br>
(A rocking horse's eyes glow and fade as Ace comes out from behind the
Tardis.) <br>
ACE: You're still a lousy parker. Hey, play time. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Well? <br>
ACE: It's a laboratory. Oh no, could a nursery, but the kids would have
to be pretty advanced. And creepy. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Be concise. <br>
ACE: It's well safe, Professor. <br>
(Ace picks up a mechanical toy and plays with it.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Oh, very succinct. <br>
ACE: It must be Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: You tell me. <br>
ACE: This equipment's prehistoric. I like the toys, though. <br>

ACE: Oh, those things are pretty sick. I can't stand dead things. Must
be Victorian. <br>

The servants hurry out of various doorways.) <br>
GROSE: It's all right, my dears. Don't worry. Our day is done. We
shan't stay here a moment longer. And heaven help anyone who's still
here after dark. <br>
(Mrs Grose lets the two maids out through the front door then leaves
herself, locking it behind her. Most peculiar.)

cupboard.) <br>
ACE: Nothing much in here. Alum, borax, carbon tetrachloride. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me guess. Benzine, arsenic, boring things like that. <br>
ACE: Yeah. Nothing volatile or explosive. <br>
DOCTOR: No, they're all used as preservative agents in the art of
taxidermy. <br>
ACE: Urgh. Gross! <br>
DOCTOR: Did you know Darwin suffered from seasickness? <br>
(Ace investigates an early type of candlestick telephone.) <br>
ACE: What I need's a phone card. <br>
DOCTOR: It's odd, that, considering his origins. <br>
ACE: Professor, how'd you dial out on this thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Ace! Don't touch that! <br>
ACE: Why not? It's my initiative test. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll give us away. These days, trespassers end up in Newgate.
<br>
ACE: The prison? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It took me three weeks to try and get out the last time.
Now give me that phone. Get off. <br>

DOCTOR: Er, sorry, wrong number. </i></font></p>

DOCTOR: Victorians are sticklers for etiquette. <br>

told you I've got this thing about haunted houses. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you tell me that? <br>
ACE: Yes! <br>
DOCTOR: How many have you been in? <br>
ACE: One was enough. Never again.

hall wall open and four housemaids come out. A young woman is staring
blankly at the fire when a man puts his hands on her shoulders.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Ace and the Doctor hide from the prim maids.) <br>
ACE: We used to go to museums on school trips. It was always don't
touch, don't wander off, don't give the school a bad name. We still did
it, though. <br>
DOCTOR: The front door's this way. <br>
(Ace spots a stuffed bird on a side table.) <br>
ACE: Hello, what's your name? You got stuffed and it wasn't even
Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: Ace. <br>
ACE: See you later. <br>
[The Doctor spots a small sliver stuff box on the carpet.] <br>
DOCTOR: What do you make of that? <br>
ACE: Don't know. Whose initials are RFC? <br>
DOCTOR: It's your initiative test. <br>
ACE: So I'm asking the questions. When was the Royal Flying Corp
invented? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, the name wasn't thought up until 1912. I can get you a
badge if you like. Ask me another. <br>
(The Doctor gets a gizmo out, then moves Ace's hand away from the
little box.) <br>
ACE: Who's RFC? Professor, I'm only looking. <br>
DOCTOR: Looking's one thing. <br>
(He puts away his first gizmo and gets out a second. Click, click,
click.) <br>
ACE: It's radioactive. <br>
DOCTOR: Very slightly. <br>
ACE: Is it safe? <br>
DOCTOR: There is no safe level. <br>
ACE: What about RFC? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's hope he abandoned it before he came to any harm. <br>
(Someone lowers an African spear between them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Zulu assegai. Quite lethal. <br>
(It is being held by a blond man with a moustache.) <br>
REDVERS: Where did you find it? <br>
DOCTOR: Here. I wouldn't touch it if I were you. This is my friend Ace,
and I'm the Doctor. <br>
REDVERS: I'm a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? So am I, several times over. <br>
ACE: Is it your snuffbox? <br>
REDVERS: Please, young lady, you're barely dressed. <br>
ACE: Who's undressed? <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse my young friend. She comes from a less civilised clime. <br>
ACE: What do you want me to do, wrap up in a curtain? <br>
DOCTOR: Be quiet, noble savage. I'm sure in Central Africa you've seen
far grislier sights than Ace's ankle. <br>
ACE: He can't see my ankle. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, your boots, then. You're a big game hunter, I take it. <br>
REDVERS: I am, but I've seen nothing that equals the atrocities that
are rumoured about this house. <br>
ACE: Is this the surprise, Professor? Because I'm not impressed. <br>
REDVERS: I must say, I'm very grateful to find an ally, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: You are? <br>
REDVERS: You have given me the proof I needed. <br>
DOCTOR: The snuff box. <br>
ACE: Don't touch it! <br>
(Redvers picks up the snuff box.) <br>
REDVERS: This is the first substantial evidence that I have found. I
came here to find
Redvers Fenn-Cooper, one of the finest explorers in the Empire. <br>
DOCTOR: R F C. <br>
REDVERS: I just knew he was in this house. I am commanded to find him
and save him from the clutches of that blackguard, Josiah Samuel Smith.

Mrs Pritchard. The other two are lined up on the main staircase.
Reverend Matthews comes out of a room.) <br>
MATTHEWS: Are you aware that I have been ringing for attention since
before six o'clock? I demand to see your master immediately. This
insolence has gone far enough. If I leave now, madam, Mister Smith will
regret the consequences. The condemnation of the Royal Society can be
ruinous. So be it. <br>
GWENDOLINE: Reverend Matthews, you must forgive us for keeping you
waiting. I am Mister Smith's ward. <br>
MATTHEWS: You are Gwendoline, are you not? <br>
GWENDOLINE: Yes, sir. My guardian was most concerned that you'd been
kept waiting, but be assured he'll join us shortly. </font></p>

articulated skeleton of a small, long-tailed ape, and a cabinet with a
cups above a rack of guns.) <br>
REDVERS: Josiah Smith invited Redvers here. Redvers is his sternest
opponent and <br>
ACE: One of the finest explorers in the Empire. <br>
DOCTOR: And he hasn't been seen since. <br>
ACE: Perhaps he got lost on the way. <br>
REDVERS: Henry Stanley found Doctor Livingstone. I shall find Redvers
Fenn-Cooper. <br>
(Redvers, for it is he, puts the assegai away with the guns. The Doctor
checks him over with the Geiger counter.) <br>
REDVERS: Damn tsetse flies. <br>
DOCTOR: How long did you say he'd been living in this house? <br>
ACE: Can we go now, Professor? The whole place gives me the creeps. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought it might. <br>
ACE: Well, he's a head case. The house is like a morgue. Everything
dead. <br>

NIMROD: Very good, sir, I understand. I shall be with you shortly. <br>
(He is not quite homo sapiens, judging by the heavy brow ridges. He
goes to the locked door.) <br>
NIMROD: Poor silent brute. <br>
(Nimrod leaves, and an eye looks through a peep hole.) <br>
VOICE: Not silent now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Trophy room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> REDVERS: Redvers had some stories. The pigmies
from the Eluti forest lead him blind fold for three whole days through
uncharted jungle. They took him to a swamp full of giant lizards like
giant dinosaurs. Do you know, young Conan Doyle just laughed at him.
Huh. Well, there's Doctor's for you. <br>
DOCTOR: That wouldn't be a Chinese fowling piece, would it by any
chance? <br>
REDVERS: We're two weeks out of Zanzibar. I must find Redvers! <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me what else you found. <br>
REDVERS: Nothing! <br>
DOCTOR: Describe it. It's all right, I'm a Doctor. <br>
REDVERS: Yes, there was light. <br>
DOCTOR: A bright light? <br>
REDVERS: Burning bright in the heart of the interior. It burnt through
my eyes into my mind. It had blazing, radiant wings! <br>
(Redvers levels the gun at the Doctor's head, and Ace makes a dive at
him.) <br>
ACE: Doctor! <br>
(Redvers moves and she goes flying over a table. The Doctor backs away
to the curtains.) <br>
REDVERS: Once, when Redvers was in the Congo, he faced a herd of
stampeding buffalo head on. He raised his gun and with one single
bullet <br>
(The Doctor dodges aside, pulling the curtain aside to reveal Redver's
reflection in the window.) <br>
REDVERS: Ah, there you are, old chap. Redvers, I've found you. What
have they done to you? You look like a ghost. <br>
ACE: Is it really him? <br>
DOCTOR: His mind's snapped. He's seen something too big to handle and
snuff out. A light. I think we'd better go get some help. <br>
ACE: That'll blow our cover. All right, all right. <br>
(Ace opens the door and Mrs Pritchard enters with two maids and the
butler.) <br>
PRITCHARD: Fenn-Cooper, where have you been? <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do, I'm the Doctor and this is my friend <br>
PRITCHARD: We've been worried about you. <br>
REDVERS: Poor old Redvers. Poor old chap. <br>
(Mrs Pritchard takes the snuff box from Redver's pocket while a maid
takes the gun.) <br>
PRITCHARD: Come along. <br>
(Mrs Pritchard twists Redver's arm up behind his back and marches him
out of the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: We don't want him hurt. <br>
REDVERS: No, not the interior! Please, I don't want to go back to the
interior! <br>
(They leave with Redvers and the gun, closing the door behind them.) <br>
ACE: You don't have to twist his arm like that! <br>
NIMROD: A most unfortunate mishap, sir. I trust you and the young lady
are not hurt? The gentleman has fits of distracting behaviour and must
for his own safety be confined. <br>
ACE: She didn't have to hurt him. <br>
DOCTOR: My friend, Ace and I <br>
NIMROD: My master, Mister Smith asks if you will join our other guest
in the drawing room. <br>
ACE: (sotto) Professor, is this an asylum with the patients in charge? <br>
DOCTOR: Given a chance it could be Bedlam. Thank you, er? <br>
NIMROD: Nimrod, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Nimrod. Thank you Nimrod. We would be delighted. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GWENDOLINE: But Uncle Josiah is a good man, and a
great naturalist too. You'll see when you meet him. <br>
(Nimrod shows in the Doctor and Ace.) <br>
MATTHEWS: Ah, so you finally condescend to meet me, sir. I am grateful
for your hospitality. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do. How nice of you to come. <br>
MATTHEWS: Good grief. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, this is my friend Ace. <br>
MATTHEWS: I see that all the stories about you are true. You have no
shred of decency, even parading your shameless wantons in front of your
guests. <br>
ACE: Does he mean me, Professor? <br>
MATTHEWS: I have it. This is some experiment related to your
mumbo-jumbo theories. Perhaps she'll evolve into a young lady. <br>
ACE: Who are you calling young lady, Bog brain? <br>
DOCTOR: No such luck. Quiet, Eliza. Now be a good girl. I'm making some
small talk. <br>
NIMROD: Ahem. If I might explain, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Nimrod, yes. There's still some tea in the pot if you'd
like to go and get a couple of cups. Thank you very much. <br>
(The Doctor gives a large tooth to Nimrod.) <br>
NIMROD: The fang of a cave bear! A totem of great power. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you, Nimrod. <br>
(The Doctor eases Nimrod out of the room and closes the doors.) <br>
GWENDOLINE: Sir, I think Mister Matthews is confused. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind, I'll have him completely bewildered by the time I'm
finished. <br>
ACE: I'll help. <br>
DOCTOR: [to Gwendoline] We've had some trouble with our carriage and
Ace can't go to dinner dressed like this. <br>
ACE: Who says? <br>
DOCTOR: So I wonder if you have any appropriate apparel that she may
borrow? <br>
GWENDOLINE: Gladly, Professor. Come, Alice. You can borrow a dress of
mine. <br>
ACE: It's Ace, actually. Thanks anyway. <br>
(Gwendoline and Ace leave. Lightning flashes above the big house.) <br>
MATTHEWS: Now, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, let me guess. My theories appall you, my heresies outrage
you, I never answer letters, and you don't like my tie. <br>
MATTHEWS: You are a worse scoundrel than Darwin. <br>
(Josiah Samuel Smith enters, wearing dark glasses and with cobwebs or
dust on his shoulders.) <br>
JOSIAH: Light! <br>

DOCTOR: Ah, Josiah Samuel Smith, I take it. Dust to dust. I'm The
Doctor and this is <br>
JOSIAH: The Reverend Ernest Matthews, Dean of Merton College, Oxford.
Your servant says welcome to Gabriel Chase. <br>
MATTHEWS: Josiah Smith. Now perhaps you'll account for your theories. <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating moths. <br>
JOSIAH: I recently made a study of these moths. Even in a single
species there can be a wide variation of colouring from countryside to
town. I'm certain they're adapting to survive the smoke with which
industry's tainting the land. <br>
MATTHEWS: Darwinian claptrap. <br>
<i> JOSIAH: Nonsense, you say? I had hoped to find you more
adaptable. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, adapt or become extinct, Ernest. <br>
MATTHEWS: No one asked for your opinion, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, I suggest you concede to my wisdom and button it.
<br>
MATTHEWS: I beg your pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: Why don't you just read Darwin instead of condemning him. </i>

places, full of lost luggage and lost souls. <br>

here in 1881 to investigate the disappearance of the owner, Sir George
Pritchard. <br>
ACE: But that was two years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he's been in Josiah's cupboard ever since. Preserved,
hypnotised. Humour him. <br>

DOCTOR: Gwendoline, who does this remind you of? <br>
(It is Gwendoline and her mother, Lady Pritchard.) <br>
DOCTOR: Severe trauma. I could forgive her arranging those little trips
to Java <br>
REDVERS: She was hypnotised, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: If she didn't enjoy them so much. <br>
ACE: Professor, Control's got a few things to show Josiah. <br>
(Control has improved her diction, just like Eliza Doolittle.) <br>
CONTROL: No longer hiding. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Just in time for dinner. <br>
(The Doctor offers Control his arm.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (An owl hoots outside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good evening, Josiah. (to Ace) Don't have the soup. <br>
JOSIAH: Get that creature out of here. Get it out. <br>
ACE: Go on, Control. Knock 'em dead. <br>
CONTROL: Control has her freeness now, squire. <br>
JOSIAH: What's this? Where's Gwendoline? <br>
CONTROL: Better orf without you, guv'nor. <br>
JOSIAH: You win this move, Doctor, but I will not suffer that creature
at my table. <br>
REDVERS: That, sir, is no way to speak in front of a ladylike. <br>
ACE: Oi, Jungle Jim, I'm here too, you know. <br>
CONTROL: No one hurting Control. Not in gutter now. <br>
DOCTOR: Who was it said Earthmen never invite their ancestors round to
dinner? <br>
(All together now - Douglas Adams!) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, which reminds me. Lady Pritchard, have you seen this? <br>
(The Doctor shows her the locket.) <br>
DOCTOR: It belongs to your daughter Gwendoline. And there's a portrait
of you in there, you see? Very nice likeness. You and Sir George must
have been very happy before the cuckoo invaded your nest. <br>
PRITCHARD: Gwendoline. Oh, oh, Gwendoline. <br>
(Lady Pritchard rushes out with the locket, sobbing.) <br>
JOSIAH: Mrs Pritchard, you're not dismissed. <br>
REDVERS: Let her alone, sir. The lioness always protects her cubs. <br>
(Ace is exploring the soup tureen with the ladle.) <br>
DOCTOR: No soup, Ace. <br>
JOSIAH: There's no way out of his for you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I knew it was a trap as soon as I walked in to it.
Unfortunately, your guest of honour seems to have let you down. <br>
JOSIAH: Light will come. <i> </i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> (Light flies into the attic, where Nimrod
is still standing quietly.) <br>
LIGHT: It's still changing, seething. Every plain and crevice crawls
with life, but I recognise the stench of its over-ripe infested
carcase. </i> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PRITCHARD: Gwendoline? <br>
GWENDOLINE: Mama? <br>
PRITCHARD: Oh, Gwendoline. <br>
GWENDOLINE: Mama! <br>
PRITCHARD: Oh, my dear. Oh, my dear. Oh, we were so happy once. Do you
remember riding down to the village with your father, the dogs running
behind, barking? And then he went away, to Java. You sent him. <br>
GWENDOLINE: Mama, I thought you were lost. <br>
PRITCHARD: Oh, I am, my dear. We both are. <br>
GWENDOLINE: Oh, Mama, what have we done? <br>
(Light appears.) <br>
LIGHT: You changed. Like the rest of this verminous planet, you adapted
to your situation to survive. <br>
(Nimrod enters.) <br>
LIGHT: Well, you'll never change again. <br>
(Lady Pritchard and Gwendoline turn to stone.) <br>
NIMROD: They never harmed you. <br>
LIGHT: I've decided Earth's future. <i>We must collect items
from the ship. Follow me.</i> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Josiah, tell me about your plan to
assassinate Queen Victoria. <br>
ACE: You what? <br>
JOSIAH: Who have you been talking to? <br>
DOCTOR: Myself, mostly. <i>But you're not really empire
material, are you? I mean, your background's a bit dodgy. And light
wouldn't be amused. <br>
ACE: Neither will Queen Vic. </i><br>
JOSIAH: The British Empire's an anarchic mess. There's no clear
directive from the throne, mo discipline. Result? Confusion, wastage. I
can provide a new order. Wealth, prosperity. <br>
DOCTOR: Confusion, wastage, tyranny, burnt toast, till all the atlas is
pink. <br>
(The Doctor hums 'Rule Britannia' and salutes.) <br>
DOCTOR: But it isn't your invitation to Buckingham Palace. Redvers? <br>
REDVERS: I am allowed to take a guest. <br>
(Redvers walks round the table with the invitation in his hand.) <br>
CONTROL: Control proper ladylike now. Out to dinner. Take Control
meeting Queen lady. <br>
JOSIAH: Redvers, we agreed. We hunt the crowned Saxe-Coburg together. <br>
REDVERS: I gave up on Redvers long ago. All he ever talks about is
himself. Here, Control. <br>
(Control takes the invitation, and Redvers slaps Josiah's hand away.) <br>
CONTROL: It's mine, or I burn it. <br>
JOSIAH: You basest creatures. You dare to defy me? I'm a man of
property! <br>
CONTROL: Then I burn whole house up. <br>
JOSIAH: No! <br>
(Control holds the invitation over the fire.)&nbsp;<br>
ACE: No, Control, don't do it! Please don't do it! That's what I did! <br>
DOCTOR: In 1983? Ace, you didn't tell me that. <br>
ACE: You're not my probation officer. You don't have to know
everything. <br>
DOCTOR: Ace. <br>
ACE: It was the house. It was full of evil and hate left by him. So I
burnt the house down. I had to. <br>
CONTROL: It is wickedness. <br>
JOSIAH: No! <br>
(Control drops the invitation into the flames. Josiah tries to pick it
out again but cannot.) <br>
DOCTOR: He only wanted to take over an Empire. At least he didn't want
to destroy the world. <br>
(Light appears.) <br>
DOCTOR: Light, I think I've solved your problem for you. <br>
LIGHT: There's only one solution to Earth. I was going to reduce it to
this. <br>
(Light picks up a ladle full of soup.) <br>
ACE: Oh, no. <br>
DOCTOR: So you started with Inspector MacKenzie. <br>
JOSIAH: The cream of Scotland Yard. <br>
DOCTOR: Primordial soup, the most precious substance in the universe,
from which all life springs. <br>
LIGHT: Merely sugars, proteins and amino acids. But it will soon start
to evolve again, so I'm going to stop the change here. All organic life
will be eradicated in the firestorm. And when this world is destroyed,
no more change, no more evolution, no more life. No more amendments to
my catalogue. <br>
DOCTOR: But you evolve too, Light. <br>
LIGHT: Nonsense! <br>
DOCTOR: Of course you do. You change, adapt, all the time. Your
attitude, your place, your mind. I mean, look at you now. You're no
longer your original shape. And I don't think much about your
catalogue. It's full of gaps. <br>
LIGHT: All organic life is recorded. <br>
DOCTOR: What about the gryphons, the basilisks? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Entrance hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: You missed the dragons, the
bandersnatches. Then there are the slithy toves and the crowned
Saxe-Coburg. <br>
(Light appears. He's not as bright and golden as he first was.) <br>
LIGHT: Where are these items? <br>
DOCTOR: I can't think how you missed them. You have to complete the
catalogue before you can destroy all life here. <br>
LIGHT: Control? <br>
DOCTOR: She's no use to you now. She's evolved as well. <br>
LIGHT: No! All slipping away. <br>
DOCTOR: All is change, all is movement. Tell me, Light, haven't you
just changed your location? <br>
LIGHT: Not yet. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter, Light, changed your mind? <br>
LIGHT: You are endlessly agitating, unceasingly mischievous. Will you
never stop? <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose I could. It would make a change. <br>
LIGHT: Nimrod! I can rely on you. Assist me now. <br>
NIMROD: I'm sorry, sir. My allegiance is to this planet, my birthright.
<br>
LIGHT: Argh! Everything is changing. All in flux. Nothing remains the
same. <br>
DOCTOR: Even remains change. It's this planet. It can't help itself. <br>
LIGHT: I will not change. I'll wake up soon. No change. Dead. <br>
(Ace, Redvers and Control come out of the dining room as Light stops.) <br>
DOCTOR: Subject for catalogue. File under Imagination comma lack of. <br>
NIMROD: Excuse me, sir, but Light instigated the firestorm programme
sometime prior to dinner. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
ACE: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: A very big explosion, very soon. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ACE: How do we stop it? Same as before? <br>
DOCTOR: Ace, don't touch that. <br>
ACE: It'll nuke Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Look. <br>
(Redvers, Control and Nimrod line up by a wall panel.) <br>
ACE: Fine time to watch a video. <br>
DOCTOR: How does this ship travel? <br>
ACE: Speed of thought. It's alive. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Light's gone. The ship survives, along with a new crew. <br>
(Josiah creeps in, grabs Ace from behind and hold a revolver to her
head.) <br>
JOSIAH: Turn off the power, Doctor. <br>
ACE: Get off, scumbag! <br>
JOSIAH: I'll have my empire yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Josiah, the ship doesn't want you to. <br>
REDVERS: There's a place for you here, old chap. <br>
CONTROL: Stop that immediately. Get back where you belong. <br>
(The head of one of the husks explodes. Josiah lets Ace go as he
collapses.) <br>
DOCTOR: There go the rungs in his evolutionary ladder. <br>
ACE: Go on, then. Evolve your way out of that one. <br>
(Control slips a choke chain around Josiah's neck.) <br>
JOSIAH: No way out now. No changing. <br>
CONTROL: You are the most unhappy creature. I shall look after you. <br>
ACE: They swapped over. <br>
NIMROD: We have our work to do, sir. Entries and amendments to revise
to complete the catalogue. <br>
ACE: No nukes, then? Isn't it going to explode? <br>
DOCTOR: Explode or fly. I mean, after all, it is a spaceship. <br>
NIMROD: The energy will be redeployed for our departure, sir. <br>
REDVERS: Redvers has the whole universe to explore for his catalogue.
New horizons, wondrous beasts, light years from Zanzibar. <br>
CONTROL: Doctor, something tells me you are not in our catalogue, nor
will you ever be. <br>
DOCTOR: You're busy. Must fly. <br>
ACE: Bye, bye. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
REDVERS: Bye. <br>

DOCTOR: The house will remember. Just the ghost of an evil memory
lingering. A dark secret after the candle is out. <br>
(The Doctor starts the grandfather clock again.) <br>
ACE: I felt it here in a hundred years time. <br>
DOCTOR: An evil older than time itself. <br>
ACE: So I burnt the house down. <br>
