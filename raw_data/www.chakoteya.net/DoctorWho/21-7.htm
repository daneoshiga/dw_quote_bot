backgammon with large pyramidical pieces. Their father enters and takes
notes.) <br>
REMUS: Where's mother? <br>
SYLVEST: She's busy. <br>
ROMULUS: Does that mean she isn't talking to us? <br>
SYLVEST: No, she's just busy. <br>
BOTH: We would like to see her. <br>
SYLVEST: She isn't here. <br>
REMUS: She's gone out without saying goodbye? <br>
SYLVEST: Well, yes. <br>
ROMULUS: I suppose you're going out as well. <br>
SYLVEST: In a few minutes. <br>
REMUS: Abandoned again. <br>
ROMULUS: You we forgive, Father, but not Mother. <br>
SYLVEST: Look, Romulus, I wish you would be kinder to your mother. You
too, Remus. <br>
BOTH: Why? <br>
SYLVEST: She is your mother. <br>
REMUS: Because Mother happened to give birth to us, does that
automatically grant her a place in our affections? <br>
SYLVEST: Yes. Yes, of course. <br>
REMUS: Respect must be earned, Father. Mother is a fool, you know that.
Do you now wish us to respect fools? You've always said the contrary. <br>
SYLVEST: Your mother is who she is, whether you think her a fool or
not. It's no excuse for poor manners and lack of concern. <br>
REMUS: As you wish, Father. <br>
SYLVEST: I gather there's something you wanted to talk to me about? <br>
REMUS: Not talk to you, tell you. We're going to play Equations. <br>
SYLVEST: Oh, no. <br>
ROMULUS: You know, I sometimes think you're actually scared of us. <br>
SYLVEST: I worry, Romulus. I honestly believe that neither of you has
the faintest idea of your real powers. Your mathematical skill could
change events on a massive scale. Don't you realise that? <br>
REMUS: Oh, don't be so dramatic, Father. <br>
ROMULUS: Sometimes you sound just like Mother. <br>
REMUS: So why don't you stop worrying? Buzz off and enjoy your evening
out.<br>
ROMULUS: We'll still be here when you get back. <br>
REMUS: And so will the universe. </font></p>

new face.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Peri, what do you think? <br>
PERI: It's terrible. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind about the clothes, they're easily changed. What
about me? <br>
PERI: I meant you. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry? I'm afraid I don't understand. <br>
PERI: Well, neither do I. I mean, people don't change like that. I
mean, physically, just in a flash. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not people, Peri. I happen to be me. <br>
PERI: But why? <br>
DOCTOR: Natural metamorphosis. A form of rebirth. I call it a renewal,
and this time, positive triumph. I can sense it in every fibre of my
being. <br>
PERI: Have you the faintest idea what you look like? <br>
DOCTOR: My outward appearance is of no importance whatsoever. <br>
PERI: Well, it is to me. I have to live with it. <br>
(She goes through his jacket pockets and finds a mirror compact.) <br>
PERI: Here, look at yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well, if you insist. <br>
PERI: What do you see? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. A noble brow. Clear gaze. At least it will be, given a few
hours sleep. A firm mouth. A face beaming with a vast intelligence. My
dear child, what on Earth are you complaining about? <br>
(He gives her the mirror back.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's the most extraordinary improvement. <br>
PERI: On what? <br>
DOCTOR: My last incarnation. I was never happy with that one. <br>
PERI: Why ever not? <br>
DOCTOR: It had a sort of feckless charm, which simply wasn't me. <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis interior.) <br>
PERI: Oh, what absolute rubbish! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis interior]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PERI: You were almost young. I really liked you.
And you were sweet and <br>
DOCTOR: Sweet? Effete. Sweet? Sweet? Sweet? Huh, that says it all. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Oh, but this has been a timely change.
Change. What change? There is no change. No rhyme, no time. <br>
(The Doctor starts to cringe amongst a rack of clothes.) <br>
DOCTOR: No place for space. Nothing. Nothing but the grinding engines
of the universe, the crushing boredom of eternity. </font></p>

small gridded screen attached. They sit back to back. Large screen on
the walls facing them clear, then Remus starts tapping various squared

screens. Romulus makes his reply and they continue to build lines of
symbols.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has recovered from his momentary
breakdown and is looking through various outfits. He picks out Patrick
Troughton's fur coat.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? No. <br>
(He throws it down and picks up a red velvet jacket a la Jon Pertwee.) <br>
PERI: Are you sure you're all right? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear child, stop worrying. Try to understand. Regeneration
in my case is a swift but volcanic experience. A kind of violent
biological eruption in which the body cells are displaced, changed,
renewed and rearranged. <br>
(He tries on the jacket then discards it.) <br>
DOCTOR: There are bound to be side-effects. <br>
PERI: It won't happen again? <br>
(The Doctor flexes his biceps and sucks in his tummy in front of a
cheval mirror.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, may indeed, but each time with diminishing effect. You
have nothing to fear. <br>
PERI: Well, next time I'm not going to look. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you find it so upsetting, that would be the most
sensible thing to do. Ah ha! <br>
(He finds a multicoloured jacket on another rail.) </font></p>

each other. An older man in a long cream robe appears.) <br>
REMUS: Fantastic! <br>
ROMULUS: What a super trick. <br>
EDGEWORTH: Oh, I wouldn't impose upon you for a moment. It's no more
than a simple illusion. <br>
REMUS: Oh, we know that. <br>
ROMULUS: We've seen it before in the theatre. <br>
REMUS: You did it jolly well. <br>
EDGEWORTH: Thank you. Your own talents are vastly superior. Amazing,
quite amazing. A symphony in higher mathematics. <br>
ROMULUS: It just so happened we've had a good evening. Who are you, by
the way? <br>
EDGEWORTH: Professor Edgeworth. <br>
ROMULUS: Never heard of you. <br>
EDGEWORTH: No reason why you should. <br>
REMUS: What do you want? <br>
EDGEWORTH: I came to pay my respects to your father, the Professor. A
man of great distinction. <br>
ROMULUS: A bit late for social calls. <br>
EDGEWORTH: Yes. I must apologise. I've come a long way. <br>
BOTH: How did you get in here? <br>
EDGEWORTH: How does one enter a dwelling? <br>
ROMULUS: Nobody's allowed in when our parents are away. <br>
EDGEWORTH: Oh, come now, do you think I look as though I'm going to do
you harm? <br>
ROMULUS: Beside the point. You oughtn't to be here. <br>
EDGEWORTH: Oh, then I shall leave. When do you expect your parents
back? <br>
BOTH: We don't know. <br>
EDGEWORTH: Tell your father I'll call him. <br>
BOTH: All right. <br>
EDGEWORTH: Goodbye, Remus. It's been a privilege and pleasure. <br>
(Edgeworth clamps Remus' hand, and the boy goes very still.) <br>
EDGEWORTH: Goodbye, Romulus. Our paths are bound to cross again. <br>
(He does the same to Romulus.) <br>
EDGEWORTH: Show me your hands. <br>
(The twins hold out their right hands. Each has a green circle on their
wrists.) <br>
EDGEWORTH: Now, what are your names? <br>
ROMULUS: I am Romulus. <br>
REMUS: I am Remus. <br>
EDGEWORTH: What is this place? <br>
BOTH: We do not know. <br>
EDGEWORTH: Good. Excellent. Come. Hold onto my sleeve. <br>
(Edgeworth rubs his signet ring, and all three vanish.) </font></p>

of the cricket outfit and into a gaudy frock coat where every panel is
a different colour and pattern. He picks an enamel cat pin from a small
box and fastens it to his lapel. With the mustard and red striped
trousers and white spotted teal tie in a loose bow, he is very
noticeable.) <br>
PERI: You're not serious. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm always serious. <br>
PERI: You can't go out dressed like that. <br>
DOCTOR: Why ever not? <br>
PERI: You look dreadful. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear, that is what people said about Beau Brummell. Remember
him? <br>
PERI: Well, he had taste, a feeling for style. <br>
DOCTOR: And I don't? <br>
PERI: Not if what you're wearing is an example. It's, oh, yuck. </font></p>

NOMA: Right, his time is up. I shall contact Mestor. <br>
DRAK: Too late, he's got them. He's coming now. <br>
(Edgeworth and the twins transmat in.) <br>
EDGEWORTH: Lock them in the bunker. <br>
NOMA: At once. <br>
(The two Jacondans escort the twins out. Edgeworth picks up a small
communicator.) <br>
EDGEWORTH: Mestor? <br>
MESTOR [OC]: Yes, Edgeworth. <br>
(This might be telepathic, as a red image of something alien is visible
along with Edgeworth.) <br>
EDGEWORTH: I have them on board. <br>
MESTOR [OC]: Are they docile? <br>
EDGEWORTH: For the moment, yes. I gave them a selective amnesia. <br>
MESTOR [OC]: When will they be missed? <br>
EDGEWORTH: Very soon. <br>
MESTOR [OC]: You have no time to lose. There will be hue and cry. I
want no trail to Jaconda. Take them to the safe house on Titan Three. <br>
EDGEWORTH: At once. <br>
MESTOR [OC]: You will remain at the safe house until further notice. <br>

blue plaid top and green skirt.) <br>
PERI: Ta da! <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Yuck. <br>
PERI: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: Vesta Ninety Five. <br>
PERI: And where's that? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll soon find out. It's a marvellous place for a holiday,
and you and I both need a rest. I would have taken you to the Eye of
Orion, but er, the coordinates elude me at the moment. Peri. <br>
PERI: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: How did you come by a name like that? <br>
PERI: It's the diminutive of my proper name, Perpugilliam. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. <a href="http://www.readbookonline.net/read/32281/68732/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> One
morn, a peri at the gate of Eden stood disconsolate.</a> Who
wrote that? <br>
PERI: I haven't the faintest idea. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course you don't. You don't even know what a peri
(pronounced peeri) is, do you, Peri? <br>
PERI: No. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll tell you. A peri is a good and beautiful fairy in Persian
mythology. The interesting thing is, before it became good, it was
evil. And that's what you are. Thoroughly evil. <br>
PERI: Doctor, stop it! <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, not even a fairy. An alien spy, sent here to spy on me.
Well, we all know the fate of alien spies. <br>
(The Doctor lunges at Peri and grabs her around the throat. She manages
to grab the mirror from the console before he throws her to the floor,
then she shows him his reflection. He lets her go, recoiling in tears.)

LANG: Sorry to disturb you, Commander. <br>
FABIAN: What is it? <br>
LANG: The Sylvest twins are missing. The Professor found a dust-like
deposit on the floor of their room. He says it's zanium. <br>
FABIAN: Zanium? You know what that means. <br>
LANG: An extraterrestrial kidnap? <br>
FABIAN: If those twins have fallen into alien hands. This is something
I've always feared. What's the time factor? <br>
LANG: He says two hours maximum. <br>
FABIAN: Right, they're still within range. I'm ordering First Priority.
Full scale search. I want all pursuit crews launched. Briefing will
take place in flight. <br>
LANG: Commander. <br>
FABIAN: And I want you flight leader. <br>

be investigated. <br>

PERI: You had another of your fits. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't have fits. <br>
PERI: Whatever you call them. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you, manic moments of no consequence. They become less
dramatic and less and less frequent. <br>
PERI: Well this was worse. Longer. It was horrible. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't exaggerate. <br>
PERI: Exaggerate? You don't remember what you did, do you? <br>

PERI: You tried to kill me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be absurd. <br>
PERI: I'm not. <br>
DOCTOR: What you say is impossible. I have an inbuilt resistance to any
form of violence, except in self-defence. <br>
PERI: You don't! <br>
DOCTOR: I don't? Upon my word, you really are frightened, aren't you. <br>
PERI: Frightened half to death, and that's only because I'm not dead
already. <br>
DOCTOR: Something's wrong. Something's very wrong. Oh no, has it come
to that? Regenerate, yet unregenerate. Oh, alas, poor Peri. Not for us
the pleasures of Vesta Ninety Five. <br>
PERI: What are you saying? <br>
DOCTOR: I am a living peril to the universe. If this poor hive is to be
cleansed, there's only one recourse. Contemplation. Self-abnegation in
some hellish wilderness. Ten days, ten years, a thousand years! Of what
consequence is time to me? I shall become a hermit, and you, child,
shall be my disciple. I know the very place. An asteroid so desolate.
Titan Three is where I shall repent! <br>

about being a hermit. <br>
DOCTOR: Never more so. I've no need to remind you. Now, a hermit needs
a hermitage. You and I, Peri, must find one. <br>
PERI: Why bother? Isn't this place good enough? <br>
DOCTOR: Far too good. Quite useless for contemplation. No, what we need
is a cave, some utterly comfortless place where you and I can suffer
together. <br>

to minister unto my needs. They will be very simple. But nothing must
be allowed to interfere with my period of contemplation. <br>

NOMA: No sign of damage. <br>
EDGEWORTH: No. All the same, you'd better go out and check it. I don't

Mestor used to destroy the fighters. It'll clear soon. <br>

planet called Jaconda? <br>
REMUS: No. What happens there? <br>
EDGEWORTH: Its new master, its new master is a creature of infinite
ambition. He requires the gifts of your genius to further that
ambition. I cannot say more. <br>
MESTOR [OC]: But I can. Professor Edgeworth is a merciful being. <br>
(An image of Mestor appears in a doorway.) <br>
MESTOR: He believe in the sanctity of life. I do not. Fail to obey him

on the old laser scalpel. Did you hide the powerpack to his gun well? <br>

DOCTOR: Excellent. Oh, the satisfaction, Peri, knowing one has saved
the life of a brave young man. <br>
PERI: Or anyone, come to that. Is he going to be all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Are you questioning my skill? <br>
PERI: No, not your skill, Doctor. <br>

DOCTOR: His heartbeat's slow but steady as a drum. An hour's rest,
he'll be right as rain, whatever that means. An hour. An hour to kill.
How to turn it to account? We must make plans, Peri. My full powers are
returning. <br>
PERI: Plans? Do you think that wise? <br>
DOCTOR: My perception's sharpening. I can sense some massive danger
threatening the universe. <br>
PERI: I thought you were the danger to the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Me? <br>
PERI: That's what you said. That's why we came here, so that you could
meditate. <br>
DOCTOR: Words spoken in the sickness of transition. Now, there is a
sickness in the air. I can feel the vibrations. I cannot yet detect
their source, but it is there. I am never wrong. The life force itself
is in danger of extinction. We must find this evil and destroy it. <br>
PERI: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that is the problem. It's odd, Peri. The indications
are very strong. I think the clue we need is here on Titan Three.
That's it, of course, the children. <br>
PERI: Children? <br>
DOCTOR: He said something about children. <br>
PERI: So he did. <br>
DOCTOR: An interplanetary spaceman on a mission. His spacecraft
crashes, he talks about children. Abducted children. That's it, Peri.
Children of great importance kidnapped by aliens, brought here to Titan
Three, held for a king's ransom. <br>
PERI: That's absurd. <br>
DOCTOR: It's nothing of the kind. <br>
PERI: Well, you said yourself there wasn't any life here. <br>
DOCTOR: There wasn't. But we're here, he's here. Things change, Peri. <br>
PERI: You think so? <br>
(Peri turns on the scanner and it sweeps across the surface.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, what's that? <br>
PERI: What? <br>
DOCTOR: That. <br>
PERI: What? <br>
DOCTOR: That. <br>
(The base is almost like the surrounding rocky outcrops.) <br>
PERI: A bump. <br>
DOCTOR: A bump? A bump? A bump? That is something which has no business
on an uninhabited asteroid. Look at that symmetry. That's no part of
nature's handiwork. <br>
PERI: Is it far? <br>
DOCTOR: Quite a distance. Let's get going. <br>
PERI: Have you noticed the radiation level? <br>
DOCTOR: What's a little radiation when we have a purpose, a mission in
life? <br>
PERI: Silly me. What's a little radiation sickness between friends. <br>
DOCTOR: Brave heart, Tegan. Tegan? <br>
PERI: I'm Peri. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. <br>
PERI: Look, Doctor, even if you are right about the radiation level,
even if there are abducted children, you're talking about aliens. I
mean, we can't even defend ourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Peri. I won't be putting your life at any risk. Or
mine either, for that matter. This is just a simple reconnaissance. <br>
PERI: But, Lieutenant Lang? <br>
DOCTOR: Who? Oh. Oh, the patient. Well, don't worry, he'll still be

everything too quickly, you'd have no reason to keep me alive. <br>
CHAMBERLAIN: He's playing with us, master. Azmael has often spoken of
this Time Lord. He's not to be trusted. <br>

PERI: He might show us that great little trick again. You know, the one
with the green ray. <br>
DOCTOR: Embolism, isn't it? Let me tell you. Little tiny bubbles go
very well in champagne and purgatives, Noma, but not in the blood. <br>
NOMA: Wait outside. <br>

CHAMBERLAIN: Only what Azmael has said. He's supposedly a man of great
cunning. <br>
MESTOR: He's also egocentric, wilful and quite mad. Once my work is
completed, I shall take great delight in examining this Doctor more
closely. Meanwhile, find the Time Lord's Tardis. <br>

desktop computers. The Doctor gets an orrery of the Jaconda system down
from the ceiling.) <br>
DOCTOR: How does Mestor plan to bring the other two planets into the
same orbit as Jaconda. <br>
AZMAEL: A tractor beam. <br>
LANG: Does he have enough power for such a thing? <br>
AZMAEL: Oh, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, how will he stabilise Jaconda? Three planets in the same
orbit will exert enormous gravitational pressure on each other. <br>
AZMAEL: By placing them in different time zones. You see, each planet
will occupy the same space, but will be one Jacondan day ahead of the
other. <br>
DOCTOR: Very neat. <br>
PERI: Mestor can travel in time? <br>
AZMAEL: Thanks to me. <br>
(Mestor laughs. A few minutes later, the Doctor is sitting cross-legged
on the table, meditating.) <br>
PERI: Doctor? Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
PERI: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course I'm all right. I'm certainly all right. It's the
situation that's all wrong. <br>
AZMAEL: In what way is it wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Both the outer planets are smaller than Jaconda. <br>
PERI: That's obvious. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, so is the consequence if they're brought any nearer the
Jacondan sun. <br>
AZMAEL: But you're right. Why didn't I realise? <br>
DOCTOR: Your mind was on other things, my friend. <br>
AZMAEL: Yes, but to overlook something so simple. <br>
PERI: What are you two talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: A matter of simple physics. The gravitational pull of the sun
on Jaconda is more or less consistent, yes? <br>
PERI: I'll take your word for it. <br>
DOCTOR: The outer planets are smaller. Place them where Jaconda is, how
long do you think they'll last? <br>
AZMAEL: No time at all. Their orbit would rapidly decay and they'd
crash into the sun. <br>
REMUS: Causing an enormous explosion. <br>
ROMULUS: It'd be wondrous to see. <br>
AZMAEL: Now be quiet and get on with your work. <br>
LANG: Does Mestor know this could happen? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. <br>
PERI: So why do it? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but there's method to his madness, of that I'm
certain. In the meantime, carry on with your calculations. We don't
want to arouse Mestor's suspicions. </font></p>

Mestor hasn't gone to all this trouble. The egg of a slug. But where's
the mucus? The jelly, the food that feeds the young within? <br>
PERI: Does it matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. These eggs are dry and rubbery. Let's see what's
inside. A laser cutter. I must have a laser cutter. <br>

DOCTOR: It should at least have scratched the surface. <br>
PERI: Well, if it's that tough, how do the young break out? <br>
DOCTOR: How indeed? <br>
AZMAEL: It's reacted to the heat of the laser. <br>
(The baby slug has started gurgling inside its egg.) <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely what it's supposed to do, only it isn't anything like
hot enough yet. <br>
PERI: Doctor, you're talking in riddles. <br>
AZMAEL: No, no, no, he isn't, and I fear he might be right. <br>
(The twins enter.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are these all the eggs? <br>
AZMAEL: No, there are more through there. <br>
(Azmael slides back the screen on a viewport to reveal rank upon rank
of eggs on shelves reaching off into the distance.) <br>
DOCTOR: So many. Ah, it all begins to make sense. <br>
PERI: Not to me. You still haven't explained why the eggs are so tough.
<br>
DOCTOR: They were designed to withstand the temperatures of an
exploding sun. <br>
LANG: Nonsense. <br>
AZMAEL: I wish it were. <br>
DOCTOR: Mestor's colonisation is not of this planet, but the universe. <br>
AZMAEL: The exploding Jacondan sun would scatter the eggs, and nowhere
would be safe from invasion. <br>
REMUS: We've made that possible. <br>
