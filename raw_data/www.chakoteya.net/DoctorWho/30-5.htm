all of us. A brand new start for a brand new human race. Look. A new
world, far out, beyond Alpha Geminorum, just waiting for us. Its
official destination is Castor Thirty Six. I think of it as Earth Point

said to be reminiscent of Dunkirk, with boats taking refugees out into

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RATTIGAN: He's a genius. <br>
MARTHA: Just brilliant. <br>
DOCTOR: Now we're in trouble. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Spaceship]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STAAL: It seems we must revert to Basic Sontaran
Stratagem One. We will ravage this planet. Prepare weapons. Wipe them
out. Every last stinking human beast.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor carries the atmospheric converter into
the teleport.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right. So, Donna, thank you for everything. Martha, you too.
Oh, so many times. Luke, do something clever with your life. <br>
DONNA : You're saying goodbye. <br>
DOCTOR: Sontarans are never defeated. They'll be getting ready for war.
And, well, you know, I've recalibrated this for Sontaran air, so <br>
MARTHA: You're going to ignite them. <br>
DONNA: You'll kill yourself. <br>
MARTHA: Just send that thing up on it's own. I don't know. Put it on a
delay. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't. <br>
DONNA: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: I've got to give them a choice. <br>
(The Doctor teleports.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STAAL: Oh, excellent. <br>
DOCTOR: General Staal, you know what this is. But there's one more
option. You can go. Just leave. Sontaran High Command need never know
what happened here. <br>
STAAL: Your stratagem would be wise if Sontarans feared death, but we
do not. At arms. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll do it, Staal. If it saves the Earth, I'll do it. <br>
STAAL: A warrior doesn't talk, he acts. <br>
DOCTOR: I am giving you the chance to leave. <br>
STAAL: And miss the glory of this moment? <br>
SKREE [OC]: All weapons targeting Earth, sir. Firing in twenty. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm warning you. <br>
STAAL: And I salute you. Take aim. <br>
DOCTOR: Shoot me, I'm still going to press this. You'll die, Staal. <br>
STAAL: Knowing that you die too. <br>
SKREE [OC]: Firing in fifteen. <br>
STAAL: For the glory of Sontar. Sontar-ha. Sontar-ha. Sontar-ha. (etc.)
<br>
(Rattigan is working on the teleport.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'll do it. <br>
STAAL: Then do it!

RATTIGAN: Something clever. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Sontarans are still chanting.) <br>
SKREE [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven <br>
(The Doctor vanishes and Rattigan appears, catching the converter
control.) <br>
SKREE [OC]: Six, five, four, three <br>
RATTIGAN: Sontar-ha! <br>
SKREE [OC]: Two, one.&nbsp;<br>

pods. <br>
The Doctor drops into the Academy teleport, breathless.)

SYLVIA: Morning. <br>
WOMAN: Morning. <br>
SYLVIA: Walked all the way. Won't catch me driving. <br>
(The woman unlocks her car and removes the ATMOS sticker from the rear
window.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Nobles' home]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SYLVIA: The streets are half empty. People still
aren't driving. There's kids on bikes all over the place. It's
wonderful. Unpack that lot, I'm going to see if Suzette's all right. <br>
(Sylvia leaves.) <br>
WILF: I won't tell her. Best not. Just keep it as our little secret,
eh? <br>
DONNA: Yeah. <br>
WILF: And you go with him, that wonderful Doctor. You go and see the
stars, and then bring a bit of them back for your old Gramps. <br>
DONNA: Love you.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTHA: How were they? <br>
DONNA: Oh, same old stuff. They're fine. So, you going to come with us?
We're not exactly short of space. <br>
MARTHA: Oh, I have missed all this, but, you know. I'm good here, back
at home. And I'm better for having been away. Besides, someone needs
me. Never mind the universe, I've got a great big world of my own now. <br>
(The door slams shut on its own and the time rotor activates, throwing
everyone around.) <br>
DOCTOR: What? What? <br>
MARTHA: Doctor, don't you dare! <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I didn't touch anything. We're in flight. It's not
me. <br>
DONNA: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. It's out of control!&nbsp;<br>
MARTHA: Doctor, just listen to me. You take me home. Take me home right
now!</font> </p>
