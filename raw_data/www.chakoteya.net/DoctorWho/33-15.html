TOM: Are you okay? There was a call for you at the office, from your
doctor. <br>
CLARA: Did he leave an address? <br>

leaves. The Tardis is parked on the side of a lonely country road.

CLARA: Will there be cocktails? <br>
DOCTOR: On the Moon. <br>
CLARA: The Moon'll do. <br>
(They laugh and embrace.) <br>
DOCTOR: How's the new job? Teach anything good? <br>
CLARA: No. Learn anything? <br>
DOCTOR: Not a thing. <br>
(They slap palms. Alert. Tardis interference detected.) <br>
CLARA: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa. We're taking off, but the engines aren't going. <br>

recognised the ring tone. It's him, isn't it?&nbsp;<br>

of his feet.) <br>
KATE: Doctor, can you hear me? I don't think he can hear me. <br>
DOCTOR: Next time, would it kill you to knock? <br>

salutes Kate, Osgood and the squad of UNIT soldiers waiting for him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why am I saluting? <br>
KATE: Doctor, as Chief Scientific Officer, may I extend the official
apologies of UNIT <br>
DOCTOR: Kate Lethbridge Stewart, a word to the wise. As I'm sure your
father would have told you, I don't like being picked up. <br>
CLARA: That probably sounded better in his head. <br>
KATE: I'm acting on instructions direct from the throne. Sealed orders
from her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth the First. <br>
CLARA: The Queen? The First? Sorry, Elizabeth the First? <br>

DOCTOR: No more. <br>
KATE: That's the title. <br>
DOCTOR: I know the title. <br>
KATE: Also known as Gallifrey Falls. <br>
DOCTOR: This painting doesn't belong here, not in this time or place. <br>
CLARA: Obviously. <br>
DOCTOR: It's the fall of Arcadia, Gallifrey's second city. <br>
CLARA: But how is it doing that? How is that possible? It's an oil
painting in 3D. <br>
(She steps forward and we can see that she is correct.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time Lord art. Bigger on the inside. A slice of real time,
frozen. <br>
KATE: Elizabeth told us where to find it, and its significance. <br>
(The Doctor takes Clara's hand.) <br>
CLARA: You okay? <br>
DOCTOR: He was there. <br>
CLARA: Who was? <br>
DOCTOR: Me. The other me. The one I don't talk about. <br>
CLARA: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: I've had many faces, many lives. I don't admit to all of them.
There's one life I've tried very hard to forget. He was the Doctor who
fought in the Time War, and that was the day he did it. The day I did
it. The day he killed them all. The last day of the Time War. The war
to end all wars between my people and the Daleks. And in that battle
there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other, a man who
would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was
me. </font></p>

SOLDIER: Message for the High Council, Priority Omega. Arcadia has
fallen. I repeat, Arcadia has fallen. <br>
(He sees the Type 40 Tardis with the stuck chameleon circuit, and its
occupant comes towards him. This is the John Hurt Doctor

DALEK: Inform High Command we have the Doctor. Seek, locate, destroy. <br>
(The Gallifreyan family sneak away. The Doctor has etched No More into
the concrete wall.) <br>

ANDROGAR: The High Council is in emergency session. They have plans of
their own. <br>
GENERAL: To hell with the High Council. Their plans have already
failed. Gallifrey's still in the line of fire. So, he was there then? <br>
ANDROGAR: He left a message, a written warning for the Daleks. He's a
fool. <br>
GENERAL: No, he's a madman. <br>
ANDROGAR: As you can see, sir, all Dalek fleets surrounding the planet
now converging on the capital, but the Sky Trenches are holding. <br>
(Boom! The building shakes.) <br>
GENERAL: Where did he go next? <br>
ANDROGAR: What does it matter? This is their biggest ever attack, sir.
They're throwing everything at us <br>
TIME LADY: Sir, we have a security breach to the Time Vaults. <br>
GENERAL: The Omega Arsenal, where all the forbidden weapons are locked
away. <br>

ANDROGAR: I don't understand. What is the Moment? I've never heard of
it. <br>
GENERAL: The galaxy eater. The final work of the ancients of Gallifrey.
A weapon so powerful, the operating system became sentient. According
to legend, it developed a conscience. <br>
ANDROGAR: And we've never used it. <br>
GENERAL: How do you use a weapon of ultimate mass destruction when it
can stand in judgment on you? There is only one man who would even try.

I serve notice on you all. Too long I have stayed my hand. No more.
Today you leave me no choice. Today, this war will end. No more. No
more. <br>
(The War Doctor, Other Doctor or Warrior as I prefer shifts the sack he
is carrying on his back and enters a
lonely barn.)

clockwork box.) <br>
WARRIOR: How, how do you work? Why is there never a big red button? <br>
(He hears scuffling noises, and opens the door.) <br>
WARRIOR: Hello? Is somebody there? <br>
MOMENT: It's nothing. <br>
(A blonde woman who looks exactly like Rose Tyler is sitting on the
clockwork box.) <br>
MOMENT: It's just a wolf. <br>
WARRIOR: Don't sit on that! <br>
MOMENT: Why not? <br>
WARRIOR: Because it's not a chair, it's the most dangerous weapon in
the universe. <br>
(He hurries her from the barn and closes the door behind her. And there
she is, sitting on the box.) <br>
MOMENT: Why can't it be both? Why did you park so far away? Didn't you
want her to see it? <br>
WARRIOR: Want who to see? <br>
MOMENT: The Tardis. You walked for miles, and miles and miles and miles
and miles. <br>
WARRIOR: I was thinking <br>
MOMENT: I heard you. <br>
WARRIOR: You heard me? <br>
MOMENT: No more. No more. <br>

WARRIOR: Ow! <br>
MOMENT: What's wrong? <br>
WARRIOR: The interface is hot. <br>
MOMENT: Well, I do my best. <br>
WARRIOR: There's a power source inside. (penny drops) You're the
interface? <br>
MOMENT: They must have told you the Moment had a conscience. Hello! Oh,
look at you. Stuck between a girl and a box. Story of your life, eh,
Doctor? <br>
WARRIOR: You know me? <br>
MOMENT: I hear you. All of you, jangling around in that dusty old head
of yours. I chose this face and form
especially for you. It's from your past. Or possibly your future. I
always get those two mixed up. <br>
WARRIOR: I don't have a future. <br>
MOMENT: I think I'm called Rose Tyler. No. Yes. No, sorry, no, no, in
this form, I'm called Bad Wolf. Are you afraid of the big bad wolf,
Doctor? <br>
WARRIOR: Stop calling me Doctor. <br>
MOMENT: That's the name in your head. <br>
WARRIOR: It shouldn't be. I've been fighting this war for a long time.
I've lost the right to be the Doctor. <br>
MOMENT: Then you're the one to save us all. <br>
WARRIOR: Yes. <br>
MOMENT: If I ever develop an ego, you've got the job. <br>
WARRIOR: If you have been inside my head, then you know what I've seen.
The suffering. Every moment in time and space is burning. It must end,
and I intend to end it the only way I can. <br>
MOMENT: And you're going to use me to end it by killing them all,
Daleks and Time Lords alike. I could, but there will be consequences
for you. <br>
WARRIOR: I have no desire to survive this. <br>
MOMENT: Then that's your punishment. If you do this, if you kill them
all, then that's the consequence. You live. Gallifrey. You're going to
burn it, and all those Daleks with it, but all those children too. How
many children on Gallifrey right now? <br>
WARRIOR: I don't know. <br>
MOMENT: One day you will count them. One terrible night. Do you want to
see what that will turn you into? Come on, aren't you curious? <br>
A whirling portal opens above them.) <br>
MOMENT: I'm opening windows on your future. A tangle in time through
the days to come, to the man today will make of you. <br>
(A fez drops through the portal.) <br>
MOMENT: Okay, I wasn't expecting that.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: But the Time War's over. Why have you
brought us here to look at a painting? <br>
KATE: The painting only serves as Elizabeth's credentials, proof that
the letter is from her. It's not why you're here. <br>
(The Doctor breaks the wax seal and unfolds the paper.) <br>
ELIZABETH [OC]: My dearest love, I hope the painting known as Gallifrey
Falls will serve as proof that it is your Elizabeth who writes to you
now. You will recall that you pledged yourself to the safety of my
kingdom. In this capacity I have appointed you as curator of the Under
Gallery, where deadly danger to England is locked away. Should any
disturbance occur within its walls, it is my wish that you be summoned.
God speed, gently husband. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened? <br>
KATE: Easier to show you. <br>

phone.) <br>
MCGILLOP: McGillop. But that's not possible. I was just. Understood,
sir. But why would I take it there? <br>
(Meanwhile, a metal shutter comes down behind the Doctor and Clara as
they stand in front of a painting on wood of Gloriana herself.) <br>

Tennant.) <br>

river. The door is opened, and the previous Doctor gallops out on a
white horse, with a red-headed lady on the pillion.) <br>
DOCTOR 10: Allons-y! There you go, your Majesty, what did I tell you?
Bigger on the inside. <br>
ELIZABETH: The door isn't. You nearly took my head off. It's normally
me who does that. <br>
(Reclining on cushions near a tent flying the royal pennant.) <br>
ELIZABETH: Tell me, Doctor, why I'm wasting my time on you. I have wars
to plan. <br>
DOCTOR 10: You have a picnic to eat. <br>
ELIZABETH: You could help me. <br>
DOCTOR 10: Well, I'm helping you eat the picnic. <br>
ELIZABETH: But you have a stomach for war. This face has seen conflict,
it's as clear as day. <br>
DOCTOR 10: Oh, I've seen conflict like you wouldn't believe. But it
wasn't this face. But never mind that, your Majesty. Up on your feet.
Up, up. <br>
ELIZABETH: How dare you? I'm the Queen of England. <br>
DOCTOR 10: I'm not English. Elizabeth, will you marry me? <br>
ELIZABETH: Oh, my dear sweet love. Of course I will. <br>
DOCTOR 10: Ah, gotcha! <br>
ELIZABETH: My love? <br>
DOCTOR 10: One, the real Elizabeth would never have accepted my
marriage proposal. Two, the real Elizabeth would notice when I just
casually mentioned having a different face. But then the real Elizabeth
isn't a shape-shifting alien from outer space. And <br>
(He holds out a clockwork gizmo.) <br>
DOCTOR 10: Ding. <br>
ELIZABETH: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR 10: It's a machine that goes ding. Made it myself. Lights up in
the presence of shape-shifter DNA. Ooo. Also it can microwave frozen
dinners from up to twenty feet and download comics from the future. I
never know when to stop. <br>
ELIZABETH: My love, I do not understand. <br>
DOCTOR 10: I'm not your love, and yes you do. You're a Zygon. <br>
ELIZABETH: A Zygon? <br>
DOCTOR 10: Oh, stop it. It's over. A Zygon, yes. Big red rubbery thing
covered in suckers. Surprisingly good kisser. Think the real Queen of
England would just decide to share her throne with any old handsome
bloke in a tight suit, just cos he's got amazing hair and a nice horse?
Oh. <br>
(No more white horse. Instead, there's the Zygon.) <br>
DOCTOR 10: It was the horse. I'm going to be King. Run! <br>
ELIZABETH: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR 10: We're being attacked by a shape-shifting alien from outer
space, formerly disguised as my horse. <br>
(They run into a ruined building.) <br>
ELIZABETH: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR 10: It means we're going to need a new horse. <br>
ELIZABETH: Where's it going? <br>
DOCTOR 10: I'll hold it off. You run. Your people need you. <br>
ELIZABETH: And I need you alive for our wedding day. <br>
(Elizabeth kisses him, then runs.) <br>
DOCTOR 10: Oh, good work, Doctor. Nice one. The Virgin Queen? So much
for history. <br>
(Elizabeth runs through the trees while the Doctor tries to lure the
Zygon. She screams and the Doctor comes running. His gizmo is dinging a
lot.) <br>
DOCTOR 10: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, very clever. <br>
(He talks to a lop-eared rabbit.) <br>
DOCTOR 10: Whatever you've got planned, forget it. I'm the Doctor. I'm
nine hundred and four years old. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the
constellation of Kasterborous. I am the Oncoming Storm, the Bringer of
Darkness, and you are basically just a rabbit, aren't you? Okay, carry
on. Just a general warning. <br>
ELIZABETH [OC]: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR 10: Elizabeth! <br>
(He finds her lying on the ground.) <br>
ELIZABETH: That thing. Explain what it is. What does it want of us? <br>
DOCTOR 10: That's what I'm trying to find out. Probably just your
planet. <br>
(A second Elizabeth walks up.) <br>
ELIZABETH 2: Doctor. Step away from her, Doctor. That's not me. That's
the creature. <br>
ELIZABETH: How is that possible? She's me. Doctor, she's me! <br>
(The Doctor tries to use his gizmo.) <br>
ELIZABETH 2: I am indeed me. A compliment that cannot be extended to
yourself. <br>
ELIZABETH: Extraordinary. The creature has captured my exact likeness.
This is exceptional. <br>
ELIZABETH 2: Exceptional? A Queen would call it impertinent. <br>
ELIZABETH: A Queen would feel compelled to admire the skill of the
execution, before arranging one. <br>
DOCTOR 10: It's not working. <br>
ELIZABETH: One might surmise that the creature would learn quickly to
protect itself from any simple means of detection. <br>
ELIZABETH 2: Clearly you understand the creature better than I. But
then, you have the advantage. <br>
(A vortex appears in the air.) <br>
DOCTOR 10: Back, both of you, now! That's a time fissure. A tear in the
fabric of reality. Anything could happen. <br>

constantly. <br>
DOCTOR 10: The Sky Trench is holding, but what if the whole planet just
disappeared? <br>
CLARA: Tiny bit of an ask. <br>
DOCTOR 10: The Daleks would be firing on each other. They'd destroy
themselves in their own crossfire. <br>

would look to the rest of the universe as if they'd annihilated each
other. <br>

CLARA: Need a moment alone with your painting? <br>
DOCTOR: How did you know? <br>
CLARA: Those big sad eyes. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
CLARA: I always know. Oh, by the way, there was an old man looking for
you. I think it was the curator. <br>
(She goes into the Tardis. The Doctor sits and looks at the painting.) <br>
DOCTOR: I could be a curator. I'd be great at curating. I'd be the
Great Curator. I could retire and do that. I could retire and be the
curator of this place. <br>
CURATOR: You know, I really think you might. <br>
(Yes, that is the current silver haired version of the fourth Doctor
you just heard. There's Tom Baker, leaning on a walking stick.) <br>
DOCTOR: I never forget a face. <br>
CURATOR: I know you don't. And in years to come, you might find
yourself revisiting a
few. But just the old favourites, eh? <br>
(The Doctor winks.) <br>
CURATOR: You were curious about this painting, I think. I acquired it
in remarkable circumstances. What do you make of the title? <br>
DOCTOR: Which title? There's two. No More or Gallifrey Falls. <br>
CURATOR: Oh, you see, that's where everybody's wrong. It's all one
title. Gallifrey Falls No More. Now, what would you
think that means, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: That Gallifrey didn't fall. It worked. It's still out there. <br>
CURATOR: I'm only a humble curator. I'm sure I wouldn't know. <br>
DOCTOR: Then where is it? <br>
CURATOR: Where is it indeed? Lost. Shush. Perhaps. Things do get lost,
you know. And now you must excuse me. Oh, you have a lot to do. <br>
DOCTOR: Do I? <br>
CURATOR: Mmm. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that what I'm supposed to do now? Go looking for Gallifrey? <br>
CURATOR: Oh, it's entirely up to you. Your choice, eh? I can only tell
you what I would do if I were you. Oh, if I were you. Oh, perhaps I was
you, of course. Or perhaps you are me. Congratulations. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. <br>
CURATOR: Or perhaps it doesn't matter either way. Who knows, eh? Who
knows? <br>
(The Curator leaves a happy Doctor.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR [OC]: Clara sometimes asks me if I dream. Of
course I dream, I tell her. Everybody dreams. But what do you dream
about, she'll ask. The same thing everybody dreams about, I tell her. I
dream about where I'm going. She always laughs at that. But you're not
going anywhere, you're just wandering about. <br>
(He walks out to join his past selves, backs to us, gazing out at the
stars.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: That's not true. Not any more. I have a new destination.
My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyones. It's taken me so
many years, so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going. <br>
(A big golden planet hangs in the sky. He stands between the 10th and
8.5 Doctors.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Where I've always been going. Home, the long way round. <br>
