<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"> (A scene of mud and desolation. The Tardis
materialises in a puddle, and Jamie steps out into it. Zoe is sensibly
wearing a trench coat, jodhpurs and knee high boots.) <br>
JAMIE: What a place. <br>
ZOE: Where are we? Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it looks like it, Zoe. Come on. <br>
(They pick their way over and up a slope. The Doctor whistles
'A-hunting we will go' happily to himself.) <br>
ZOE: What's this stuff? <br>
JAMIE: Aye, wee spikes. <br>
(Jamie pricks his finger.) <br>
DOCTOR: Barbed wire, Jamie. It's filthy stuff. I thought so. <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
(The Doctor pulls a tin helmet from underneath some wood.) <br>
JAMIE: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: We're back in history, Jamie. One of the most terrible times on
the planet Earth. <br>
(Whee, boom!) <br>
DOCTOR: Quick! Down there! <br>
(They dive into a nearby bomb crater in the ground. Another shell
explodes nearby as Jamie stands to watch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie! <br>
(More explosions and machine gun fire. They get splattered with soil.
An army ambulance comes trundling up through the explosions, then
suddenly all goes quiet. A woman in a great coat is standing by the
crater.) <br>
BUCKINGHAM: I say, are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, yes, I think so. <br>
BUCKINGHAM: I shouldn't stay around here if I were you. That was just
the softening up barrage. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh my. Oh. <br>
BUCKINGHAM: What on earth are you doing here, anyway? This is no place
for civilians. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, where are we? <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Between the lines, I think. Not quite sure myself. I'm
heading for Ypres, but I seem to have got <br>
(Two soldiers in gas masks are standing next to them.) <br>
GERMAN: HÃ¤nde hock. Raus schnell. <br>
(The four are taken at gunpoint to the ambulance and driven off.
Buckingham is behind the wheel. Further on, two men come running over a
rise. Buckingham stops the ambulance. The officer puts his revolver to
the German's head.) <br>
CARSTAIRS: Out you come. <br>
(Played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0767674/" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> David Savile</a>. I used
to have such a crush on him.) <br>
BUCKINGHAM: There's another in the back. <br>
CARSTAIRS: Take care of him. <br>
(Carstairs leaves his soldier covering the man up front and goes to the
back of the ambulance. Jamie and the Doctor have already overpowered
the other German.) <br>
CARSTAIRS: Well done. Get inside. <br>
(The British and German soldiers are bundled into the back. Carstairs
sits next to Buckingham up front.) <br>
CARSTAIRS: Who are those people? <br>
BUCKINGHAM: No idea. Picked them up in no man's land. <br>
CARSTAIRS: Well, I suppose we'd better get them back to base.

reporting up the telephone line. Explosions are heard almost
constantly.) <br>
BARRINGTON: They've laid down a heavy barrage all along the line. I
think that they're after that ammo dump. Don't worry, sir. We'll hold
out. <br>
SERGEANT: Sir? <br>
BARRINGTON: What is it? <br>
SERGEANT: Ambulance approaching, sir. <br>
BARRINGTON: Give it protective fire. Jump to it. man! <br>

as Carstairs helps Buckingham, the Doctor and Jamie down.) <br>
CARSTAIRS: Couple of prisoners, Sergeant. My men are bringing them in. <br>
SERGEANT: Very good, sir. <br>
JAMIE: How are we going to get back to the Tardis? <br>

SERGEANT: With the ambulance, sir, there was a Lieutenant. <br>
BARRINGTON: Well, bring him in. <br>
SERGEANT: Sir. <br>
(The Sergeant leaves, Carstairs enters.) <br>
CARSTAIRS: Lieutenant Carstairs, sir. <br>
BARRINGTON: What are you doing here? You don't belong to this
battalion, do you? <br>
CARSTAIRS: No. Patrolling in no mans land, sir. I got cut off from my
own lot. <br>
BARRINGTON: What were you doing traipsing about in ambulances? <br>
CARSTAIRS: Recaptured it from the Hun, sir. Lucky we arrived, really.
There was a WVR driving it, and three civilians inside. <br>
BARRINGTON: Civilians? In no man's land? <br>
CARSTAIRS: Your sergeant's taking care of them, sir. <br>
BARRINGTON: Good grief. Civilians.

JAMIE: The thing is, where are we? <br>
ZOE: Early twentieth century isn't it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm afraid that we've landed up in the middle of one of
the worst wars in human history. <br>
JAMIE: What are they dug into the ground like this for? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's trench warfare, you see, Jamie. These trenches
stretch right the way across the continent of Europe. <br>
JAMIE: Well, what are they fighting for? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I well I believe that they call it The War to End Wars. <br>
ZOE: Do you think they'll let us go? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they've got no reason to keep us. Here, things have
calmed down a bit. Let's try and get away. <br>
(But as soon as he puts his head up over the top of the trench, machine
gun fire.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! <br>
SERGEANT: What do you think you're doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Our transportation is over there, you see. We're trying to get
to it. <br>
SERGEANT: Over there? There's nothing over there but Huns. Anyway, the
Major wants to see you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we don't want to bother him. I'm sure he's very busy. <br>
SERGEANT: Come on! You too, ma'am, if you don't mind.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"> BARRINGTON: Right, sir. We'll go over the top at
oh four hundred hours. Sir. As you say, sir. Well, that was General
Smythe. Big push tomorrow. How long have you been out here? <br>
CARSTAIRS: Well, sir, it's odd, but I can't quite remember. <br>
BARRINGTON: I know. It seems like forever, doesn't it? <br>
SERGEANT: Civilian party, sir. Major Barrington, ma'am. <br>
BARRINGTON: How do you do, er? <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Jennifer Buckingham. <br>
BARRINGTON: Ah. I understand you picked these people up in no man's
land? <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Yes. Found them hiding in a bomb crater. <br>
BARRINGTON: I see. May I ask you what you were doing there? <br>
DOCTOR: Trying not to get killed. <br>
BARRINGTON: I see. You're a Highlander, aren't you? Why aren't you with
your regiment? <br>
JAMIE: Regiment? I'm not in the army. <br>
BARRINGTON: Are you a deserter? <br>
JAMIE: No, of course not! I <br>
BARRINGTON: All right, all right. And you, what are you doing in the
front line? No place for young ladies. <br>
ZOE: Well what about her? <br>
BARRINGTON: This lady's a WVR. She's here on duty. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, look, Major, we don't want to trouble you. If you'd just
let us go on our way. <br>
BARRINGTON: And which way is that? <br>
SERGEANT: He tried to make off towards the German line, sir. <br>
BARRINGTON: Did he, by jove. <br>
(Whee, Boom! Bits of ceiling come down.) <br>
BARRINGTON: I think General Smythe would like to know about you. (into
telephone) Get me General Smythe at base.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif">(The General sits at a simple folding table in a
once great stately home, talking into a field telephone.) <br>
SMYTHE: Civilians? In no man's land? Yes. Well, send them back here at
once. I'll question them myself. <br>
(The General's adjutant enters.) <br>
SMYTHE: Three civilians found in no man's land. <br>
RANSOM: Good lord. Whereabouts, sir? <br>
SMYTHE: Barrington's sector. He's sending them straight back here. I'm
going to turn in for half an hour. <br>
SMYTHE: Sir. <br>
SMYTHE: Let me know when these civilians arrive. <br>
RANSOM: Yes, sir. <br>

end in the corner. Smythe reaches for a portrait on the wall when the
door opens. It's the Sergeant Major with his mug of tea.) <br>
SMYTHE: Don't ever come through that door without knocking! Get out! <br>
BURNS: Right, sir. <br>
(He leaves. Smythe reaches for the portrait again and it swings open on
hinges to reveal a circular monitor and a dial. Smythe turns it on.) <br>
SMYTHE: Smythe, 1917 zone, British sector. Reinforcements urgently
required. At least five thousand specimens.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"> DOCTOR: But look, Major Barrington, if only you'd
let us get back to our transportation we'd be no further nuisance to
you. <br>
BARRINGTON: I'm sorry, you must first go to the Chateau and give a
proper account of yourselves. For all I know you may be spies. <br>
JAMIE: Oh look, we keep trying to tell you, you daft sassenach. <br>
BARRINGTON: Hold your tongue, man! <br>
JAMIE: No, I won't! <br>
DOCTOR: Now please! Don't let us lose our tempers. <br>
SERGEANT: Supply truck leaving for base now, sir. <br>
BARRINGTON: Good. Get them onto it. Off you go. <br>
JAMIE: Now, just a moment, we're not going back to any base. Now, come
on. <br>
BARRINGTON: Sentry! <br>
(Jamie's exit is stopped by a soldier and rifle.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think perhaps we'd better do as they say. <br>
BARRINGTON: I'm glad one of you is showing some sense. All right,
Sergeant, take them away. <br>
SERGEANT: Yes, sir. <br>
BUCKINGHAM: I'm sure you'll be all right. Anyway, good luck. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. <br>
(The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe leave with the Sergeant.) <br>
BARRINGTON: Now then, what are we going to do about you two? <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Could your men do something about my ambulance? It's bogged
down just over the hill. <br>
BARRINGTON: Yes, soon get that out for you. <br>
(Barrington leaves.) <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Funny about those people. They didn't look like spies. <br>
CARSTAIRS: Spies never do. I don't envy them if they are. General
Smythe can be pretty ruthless. Know what my chaps call him? <br>
BUCKINGHAM: No. <br>
CARSTAIRS: The Butcher.

CARSTAIRS: Whereabouts? <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Well, you're going to think me awfully silly, but I can't
quite remember. <br>
CARSTAIRS: Don't worry, it'll come back to you. Memory's a funny thing
out here. Can't always remember things myself. <br>
BUCKINGHAM: What kinds of things? <br>
CARSTAIRS: Oh, silly things. Names, dates, how long I've been here.
Sometimes wonder if I've got a touch of the old shell shock. Have you
talked to anybody else about it? <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Haven't liked to. One feels so stupid. <br>
CARSTAIRS: Yes. Still, it is rather worrying not being able to remember
things. <br>
(The telephone rings.) <br>
CARSTAIRS: Ah. Suppose I'd better answer that. <br>
(Barrington rushes in and takes the receiver from Carstairs.) <br>
BARRINGTON: Ah, thanks, old man. Major Barrington. Yes. Right, sir.
We're wanted at HQ. Some sort of enquiry to do with those civilians you
brought in. <br>
BUCKINGHAM: How long will it take? I'm bound to be needed back at the
hospital. <br>
BARRINGTON: We just got your ambulance out of the mud. We'll all go in
that, and then you can go straight on from HQ. Are you ready?

ZOE: These walls are solid stone. There's just no way out. <br>
JAMIE: Now what do we do, then? <br>
DOCTOR: It's just a temporary misunderstanding, Jamie. We'll get it
cleared up when we see the General. <br>
ZOE: Why should he listen to us? No one else has. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, they were all obeying orders, Zoe. That's the military
mind. <br>
ZOE: We must have looked a bit suspicious. Three civilians in the
middle of a war? <br>

them in the cells. <br>

SMYTHE: I was asleep, Captain Ransom. You did not wish to disturb me. <br>
RANSOM: Yes, sir, you were asleep. I didn't wish to disturb you. <br>
SMYTHE: That's right. Now, what did you make of these civilians? <br>
RANSOM: Oh, two men and a young lady. According to Major Barrington
they can't account for themselves. He seemed to think the younger lad
was a deserter. Apparently the older man tried to make off for the
enemy lines. <br>
BURNS: Sir! Major Barrington, sir. <br>

DOCTOR: Major Barrington, how nice to see you. <br>
BURNS: Accused! Back in line. <br>
SMYTHE: If you are ready, gentlemen? March the prisoners forward,
Sergeant Major. <br>
BURNS: Sir! Accused, one pace forward, march. <br>
JAMIE: Now, look, what's going on here? <br>
SMYTHE: The Court Martial is now in session. <br>
DOCTOR: Court Martial? But we're civilians. <br>
SMYTHE: This whole area is under martial law. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, that may be, but if you'll allow me to explain, we
were <br>
SMYTHE: You will have an opportunity of addressing the Court at the
proper time. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. <br>
SMYTHE: Now, the statements of Lieutenant Carstairs and Lady Jennifer
have been taken into evidence. The prisoners waylaid an ambulance in no
man's land <br>
DOCTOR: Waylaid? The ambulance found us. <br>
SMYTHE: The vehicle was later commandeered by a waiting enemy patrol.
Recaptured by Lieutenant Carstairs, the prisoners insinuated themselves
into a forward command post, where at the earliest opportunity one of
them made a break for the enemy lines with whatever information he had
gathered. <br>
ZOE: Oh, but none of that's true. You've twisted the whole thing. <br>
DOCTOR: This is a travesty of justice. What are we charged with? <br>
SMYTHE: In the case of this man, desertion from a Highland regiment. <br>
JAMIE: But, but <br>
SMYTHE: In the case of yourself and the girl, the charge is one of
espionage. The penalty for all these charges is death. <br>
DOCTOR: But this is monstrous! <br>
SMYTHE: We shall now hear the case for the defence. Have you anything
to say? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I most certainly have! Am I allowed to question the
witnesses? <br>
SMYTHE: Certainly. We wish to give you every opportunity to explain
yourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lady Jennifer, will you please explain to these
gentlemen the circumstances of our meeting. <br>
SMYTHE: There's no need for that. It's in the statement. Next
question.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: What? Well, Lieutenant Carstairs, when your men recaptured the
ambulance, wasn't it obvious to you we were prisoners of the Germans? <br>
SMYTHE: Has the defence finished with this witness? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you're not going to allow them to answer, what is the
use? <br>
SMYTHE: Very well. Have you any explanation to offer before the Court
passes sentence? <br>
ZOE: But you haven't heard anything yet. You don't really call this a
trial, do you? <br>
SMYTHE: The Court will now consider it's verdict. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, you haven't even asked me anything. <br>
SMYTHE: There's nothing to ask you. You are a deserter! March him away,
Sergeant Major! <br>
BURNS: Sir. Escort and accused, left turn. Left wheel, by the front,
quick march! Left, right, left, right. Halt! <br>
JAMIE: I thought you were going to explain everything? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he didn't give me a chance, did he. There's something
very strangely wrong here. <br>
ZOE: Why has that General got it in for us? He seems determined to find
us guilty. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but why? <br>
RANSOM: I don't know. They seem pretty harmless to me. <br>
BARRINGTON: Yes, there's no actual evidence of them actually spying on
anything. <br>
(Smythe puts on his spectacles.) <br>
SMYTHE: It is quite clear that they are all guilty. All guilty! <br>
BARRINGTON: Yes, they're guilty. Knew it as soon as I looked at them. <br>
RANSOM: There's clear evidence that they were spying. <br>
SMYTHE: Thank you, gentlemen. Well, I think we can resume. Sergeant
Major, bring the prisoners back. <br>
BURNS: Escort and accused, left wheel! By the front, quick march. Left,
right, left, right, left wheel. Mark time. Halt! Right turn! <br>
SMYTHE: The Court has carefully considered all of the evidence and
finds you all guilty as charged. Desertion in a time of war is a most
heinous military crime. <br>
JAMIE: Look, I've deserted from nowhere! I was never in your rotten
army. <br>
SMYTHE: You will be confined to a military barracks awaiting a
regimental Court Martial. <br>
JAMIE: Now look, I'm not being confined anywhere. <br>
SMYTHE: You, young lady, have betrayed your King and country. You are
sentenced to ten years penal servitude to be spent in a civilian
prison. <br>
ZOE: Oh but I haven't done anything! <br>
SMYTHE: The court finds you guilty of espionage. For a crime of this
magnitude there is only one penalty. <br>
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous! You know all the evidence has been
twisted against us! Tell them! <br>
SMYTHE: The witnesses have given their evidence. The court has reached
it's verdict. If you've nothing further to say, sentence will be
passed. <br>
DOCTOR: I most certainly have something further to say! This is all
just a mockery! I demand the right to appeal to a higher authority. <br>
SMYTHE: There is no right of appeal. You will be executed at dawn
tomorrow. Take him away, Sergeant Major! <br>
BURNS: Prisoners and escort, left turn! <br>
JAMIE: Now just a moment, you can't do this to us! <br>
BURNS: Hold him! <br>
JAMIE: Let go! <br>
SERGEANT MAJOR: Hand him over to the MPs. They'll take him to the
military prison. <br>
(Jamie is taken away.) <br>
BURNS: I'll take these two back to the cell, sir.&nbsp;<br>
BUCKINGHAM: Just a minute, Sergeant Major. Captain Ransom, surely
you're not going to keep this poor girl in the cells all night? <br>
RANSOM: Well, we've nowhere else to keep her. <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Well, why not leave her here? I could look after her. <br>
RANSOM: Yes, I don't see why not. <br>
BUCKINGHAM: Thank you. <br>
RANSOM: All right, put a guard on the door, Sergeant Major, and take
him away. <br>
BURNS: Sir! <br>
ZOE: Oh I don't want to leave you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Now you stay here, Zoe. Goodbye, my dear. <br>
(The Doctor kisses Zoe on the forehead and leaves with the Sergeant
Major.) <br>
ZOE: Oh, can't you help us, Lieutenant Carstairs? <br>
CARSTAIRS: Nothing I can do, I'm afraid. <br>
BARRINGTON: Well, nice to have met you both. Must be getting back.
Goodbye, my dear. Chin up. <br>
(Barrington leaves.) <br>
ZOE: But you can't let them execute the Doctor. He hasn't done
anything. <br>
RANSOM: Well, you heard the evidence, my dear. It's all proved. I'm
afraid he is a spy.

gone off the edge of my map. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"> SCIENTIST: Should you arrive on another planet,
you may not be aware that the problem is to retain the specimen's
personality as a fighting man while at the same time putting him under
our control. As you know, we remove the human specimens from their own
world and time, and place them in a context which seems to them to be
the same. It is vital that they continue to believe that they are
living their own lives on the planet Earth and fighting the wars from
which they were taken. <br>
ZOE [sotto) : So this isn't Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite right, Zoe, quite right. <br>
SCIENTIST: With the majority of human specimens, the process used is
both lasting and effective. However, in the case of certain humans of
particularly strong character and individuality, the effects of the
process have not been permanent. Gradually the processing tended to
fade and the specimens developed the ability to pass through the Time
Zone Barriers. Some formed themselves into resistance groups which have
considerably hampered the progress of our plan. It is to overcome this
problem that I have further refined our processing technique. To
demonstrate the process I chosen a particularly difficult specimen. A
man who finally shook off the effects of the process completely, and
allied himself to resistance elements in order to fight us. <br>
(Guards bring out a gurney on which Carstairs is strapped.) <br>
SCIENTIST: This Lieutenant Carstairs is a 1917 British army officer,
who for some time after his initial processing, believed himself to be
fighting for his country. However as I shall now demonstrate, the
process has completely lapsed and he is now fully conscious of his
surroundings. Where are you? <br>
CARSTAIRS: I don't know. <br>
SCIENTIST: Describe what you can see. <br>
CARSTAIRS: A room. Filled with a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo. Funny
people, strange clothes and those sort of glasses that you're wearing. <br>
(The Doctor gestures Carstairs to keep quiet.) <br>
SCIENTIST: As you see, he is fully aware of his surroundings and very
hostile. After my new technique has been applied, he will not only be
completely docile, but will be fully convinced that whatever I tell him
will be the truth. <br>
(The Scientist clamps Carstair's in a metal vice-like device and turns
it on.) <br>
ZOE: Oh, can't we help him? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, not yet. Later. <br>
SCIENTIST: This machine is, of course, only a prototype. In due course,
other machines will be built to this pattern, capable of processing
large groups of specimens simultaneously. <br>
(The machine finishes its cycle.) <br>

DOCTOR: Well, your processing machines. I can make them work more
effectively. <br>
WAR LORD: Our scientist is at this moment producing new machines on the
home planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah yes, but that will take time. I can make the old ones work
just as well. Probably better. <br>
WAR LORD: Very well. You shall have the opportunity to prove your
ability. You will adjust the machines and reprocess your resistance
friends. <br>
DOCTOR: They are no longer my friends. They are our enemies. <br>
WAR LORD: Of course they are. Take him to the processing room. See he
has every facility. <br>

WAR LORD: The resistance groups, where are they? <br>
WAR CHIEF: They are all now concentrated in this one area. I have
ordered the conventional troops to move in on them. <br>
WAR LORD: Good. When the situation returns to normal order all the
security guards to return to the control centre. All control points on
the planet are to be repaired, and the war games recommenced. <br>

(The trio are thrown to the floor.) <br>
ZOE: Oh! It's shaking itself to pieces! <br>
JAMIE: Yeah, we could all be killed! <br>
ZOE: Doctor, can't you induce a power drive? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll try. Oh, the controls. They're moving by themselves. <br>
(Everything settles down again.) <br>
JAMIE: Now where are we? <br>
ZOE: Oh, let's see on the scanner. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, it's broken. <br>
ZOE: No, I don't think so. <br>
(Suddenly the picture resolves itself into a long chamber filled with
SIDRATS along one wall.) <br>
TIME LORD [OC]: You have returned to us, Doctor. Your travels are over.
<br>
DOCTOR: It's my own planet. They have brought us here. <br>
JAMIE: Can't we get away again? <br>

the trial. <br>

again.) <br>
TIME LORD 3: In every one of these time zones, thousands of human
beings fought and died in the belief that they were on their own
planet. The survivors have now all been returned to their own times on
the planet Earth, but the death roll is beyond counting. These lives
were squandered in the course of a vicious and diabolical scheme to
gain control of the entire galaxy. A scheme originated and devised by a
race of which the accused is the leader. It was a was a highly
organised scheme with an utterly callous disregard for the lives of the
humans involved and for the liberties of all the other species in the
galaxy which the accused would have dominated with his tyranny. In the
pursuit of this scheme, brutal methods of mental processing were used
which entirely contravened all the galactic laws. I will now call upon
a member of our own race to sort this evil matter out. There will
commence a reading of the witness' report. The witness is called. Will
you step forward, please? <br>
(Over the above statement, the Doctor is explaining.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Time Lords holding a trial is a very rare event. <br>
ZOE: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, normally they don't interfere with the affairs of other
planets, but they had to when I called for help. <br>
JAMIE: Well, look, can't we get away? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you and Zoe may, but I don't think I will. <br>
TIME LORD 3: Will you step forward, please? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, oh, I beg your pardon. <br>
TIME LORD 3: We have received your statement. Do you swear to the truth
of your report? <br>
DOCTOR: Everything in that report is the result of my direct personal
observation. <br>
TIME LORD 3: Who is that person? <br>
DOCTOR: That is the War Lord. <br>
TIME LORD 3: Does the accused have anything to say? <br>
TIME LORD: You must speak in your defence. <br>
TIME LORD 2: The trial cannot proceed unless you do. <br>
TIME LORD 3: You must speak. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't you see he's just playing for time? <br>
TIME LORD 3: Do not make us force you to speak. We would not cause you
unnecessary pain. Very well. <br>
(The Time Lord widens his eyes and suddenly the War Lord falls to his
knees screaming and clutching his head.) <br>
WAR LORD: Stop it! Stop the light! <br>
TIME LORD 3: You must speak. <br>
WAR LORD: Yes. <br>
TIME LORD 3: Do you admit the charges with which you have been accused?
<br>
WAR LORD: I do not even admit the authority of this court. <br>
TIME LORD: Have you anything to say in your defence? <br>
WAR LORD: The humans who died in our war games would have killed each
other anyway. <br>
TIME LORD 2: Is your plea that that ends justifies the means? <br>
WAR LORD: Yes, it is. And members of your own race agreed with me. My
War Chief was himself was a Time Lord, and the knowledge he brought me
made the whole scheme possible. And another of your Time Lords gave me
his support! <br>
DOCTOR: I never supported your scheme for one moment. <br>
WAR LORD: You collaborated with my War Chief. If I am guilty, then you
are guilty too! <br>
(Meanwhile, two men are inside the Tardis, working on the console. One
goes out to investigate the sound of materialisation and is gunned down
by two of the War Lord's guards. The second then comes out and is also
killed. Then a total of six guards move off.) <br>
TIME LORD: We find you guilty of all charges against you. Your attempt
to incriminate others is an obvious fraud. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good. I'm glad to see your sense of justice still prevails.
(sotto) Even though they've lost their sense of humour. <br>
WAR LORD: You have no authority over me. <br>
(The guards enter.) <br>
WAR LORD: And no power any longer to pass any sentence. Take these
people. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no! <br>
JAMIE: Not again. <br>

instantly. <br>

TIME LORD 3: A force field has been placed around you, and around your
planet, so that your warlike people will remain prisoners forever. You
have been found guilty of all charges, and you and your murderous
associates will be dematerialised. It will be as though you had never
existed. <br>

which then envelopes him and Zoe.) <br>

that you have repeatedly broken our most important law of
non-interference in the affairs of other planets. What have you to say?
Do you admit these actions? <br>
DOCTOR: I not only admit them, I am proud of them. While you have been
content merely to observe the evil in the galaxy, I have been fighting
against it. <br>
TIME LORD 3: It is not we who are on trial here, Doctor, it is you. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, of course, you're above criticism, aren't you. <br>
TIME LORD: Do you admit that these actions were justified? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, I do. Give me a thought channel and I'll show
you some of the evils I've been fighting against. <br>
(The Time Lords nod to each other.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Quarks, deadly robot servants of the cruel Dominators, they
tried to enslave a peace loving race. Then there were the Yeti, more
robot killers, instruments of an alien intelligence trying to take over
the planet Earth. <br>
TIME LORD 3: All this is entirely irrelevant. <br>
DOCTOR: You asked me to justify my actions, I am doing so. Let me show
you the Ice Warriors, cruel Martian invaders, they tried to conquer the
Earth too. So did the Cybermen, half creature, half machine. But worst
of all were the Daleks, a pitiless race of conquerors exterminating all
who came up against them. All these evils I have fought while you have
done nothing but observe. True, I am guilty of interference, just as
you are guilty of failing to use your great powers to help those in
need! <br>
TIME LORD: Is that all you have to say? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, isn't it enough? <br>

considered, but you have raised difficult issues. We require time to
think about them. You will be recalled when we have made our decision.

planet Earth. The frequency of your visits must have given you special
knowledge of that world and it's problems. <br>

remain there for as long as we deem proper, and for that period the
secret of the Tardis will be taken from you. <br>

very awkward for me. <br>
