DOCTOR: Excuse me! <br>

HALL: Ay? <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder if you can help us? <br>
HALL: My mate likes the wireless turned on at full blast. I have to
keep this turned down. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. <br>
(Hall turns the wireless off.) <br>
JAMIE: Who's taken the Tardis? <br>
HALL: The what? <br>
DOCTOR: He means the police telephone box. <br>
HALL: He said Tardis or something. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, Tardis, that's another name for it. <br>
HALL: Oh, foreign, is he? <br>
JAMIE: Me, foreign? You're the one that's foreign. I'm Scottish. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. Tardis is a is a Gaelic word. Jamie, hush. <br>
JAMIE: It's getting further away all the time. <br>

point. Its ours and somebody's stolen it. <br>
HALL: Oh, I don't know about that. I've got a note here somewhere.
Yeah, here we are. There. Police Tel Box. Collection 3 o'clock. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me see this, please. <br>
HALL: Been signed for. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so I see. J Smith. Doesn't really help us, does it? <br>
HALL: Yeah, well, I just do what I'm told. You'd better see the airport
Commandant or someone. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. I don't think we'd better do that. Jamie, I think we'd
better talk to the police. <br>
HALL: Of course I, er, I do know the name of the firm what picked it
up. <br>
JAMIE: You do? <br>
HALL: Yeah, firm name of, er, Leatherman. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. You'll be hearing from us. <br>
JAMIE: Leatherman. Now that's a clue. Just a minute. Now, what street
do they? Doctor, wait. <br>
(The Doctor drags Jamie outside. Once they are out of sight, Hall talks
into his hearing aid.) <br>
HALL: Did you get all that? <br>
KENNEDY [OC]: Every word. We'd better get going. Get your money back at
the warehouse.

binoculars.) <br>
JAMIE: We should have followed that clue he gave us. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps. I think we'd better keep an eye on him. <br>
JAMIE: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, didn't you notice his overalls? They were much too small
for him, and the top sheet of his clip board was different to all the
others. And when we mentioned the police he became friendly <br>
JAMIE: Aye. Hey, may <br>

walks past. A few moments later, they follow him.)

WATERFIELD: Yes? <br>
PERRY OC]: Perry, sir. <br>
WATERFIELD: Oh, er, one moment, Mister Perry. <br>
(Waterfield unbolts the door and lets in a slight man in his early
twenties.) <br>
PERRY: It's here. <br>
WATERFIELD: Good. <br>
PERRY: Like me to open the shutters, sir? Lovely day outside. <br>
WATERFIELD: I have a choice between the sun or noise, Mister Perry. I
regret shutting out one, but at least I keep out the other. <br>
PERRY: Yes. (a clock chimes) I say, that's very good. Just come in, eh?
Mint condition. Eighteen seventy, is it? <br>
WATERFIELD: Approximately. <br>
PERRY: Don't know who your contacts are, sir, but this is marvellous. <br>
WATERFIELD: Well, Victorian timepieces are my specialty, Mister Perry. <br>
PERRY: Wish you'd tell me who makes them for you, sir. <br>
WATERFIELD: But then you would be as wise as I, and that wouldn't do at
all, would it? <br>
PERRY: Whoever makes them, Mister Waterfield, they'd fool an expert. If
I didn't know it was impossible, I'd say it was absolutely genuine. <br>
WATERFIELD: And, er, there was no trouble with the box? <br>
PERRY: Apparently not. A bit out of our line, isn't it, sir? A battered
old police box? <br>
WATERFIELD: The whims and caprices of our patrons is our line, Mister
Perry. <br>
PERRY: Hmm. Odd though. <br>
WATERFIELD: Mister Perry, I pay you the sum of 50 guineas per week, do
I not? <br>
PERRY: Pounds, actually, sir. 50 pounds. <br>
WATERFIELD: Yes. I hope I may be forgiven if I believe that entitles me
to demanding less curiosity of you. <br>
PERRY: Sorry, sir. <br>
WATERFIELD: It is, I think you will agree, a princely salary. <br>
PERRY: No complaints on that score. As long as I'm not asked to do
anything dicey. <br>
WATERFIELD: Dicey? <br>
PERRY: Crooked. Illegal. <br>
WATERFIELD: Your candour is refreshing, Mister Perry, even if your
judgement of character is somewhat questionable. <br>
PERRY: I didn't mean that <br>
WATERFIELD: I know perfectly well what you meant. You may rest assured,
I shall not ask you to do anything dicey. <br>
PERRY: No, sir. <br>
WATERFIELD: I think you are wanted in the shop, Mister Perry. <br>
PERRY: And the telephone box, sir. What do we do with it? <br>
WATERFIELD: Do? We do nothing. <br>
PERRY: Oh, right. <br>

some railway arches with lock up garages.) <br>
DOCTOR: This is his car. He must be around here somewhere. <br>
(There is an old abandoned warehouse at the end of the lane.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KENNEDY: You sure you weren't followed? <br>
HALL: No, course I wasn't. Hey, you haven't told me what this little
caper's about yet, Kennedy. <br>
KENNEDY: Counted the money yet then, have you? <br>
HALL: No, not yet. <br>
KENNEDY: Or do you think I made a mistake giving you two fifty instead
of seventy five? We thought you might like a little extra. <br>
HALL: What for? <br>
KENNEDY: You know those two at the hangar? <br>
HALL: Yeah? <br>
KENNEDY: They're outside. You weren't followed. We'll be ready for
them, won't we? That's what the extra's for. <br>
HALL: Now listen. <br>
KENNEDY: You on one side of the door, me on the other. Right? Straight
over their heads. They won't even know what hit them. <br>
HALL: Nah, not me, mate. <br>
KENNEDY: It's a bit late to argue, isn't it? They're outside. <br>
HALL: Now listen, I'm not getting mixed up in no kidnapping, and that's
flat. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Hall is lying on the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's the man in the overalls. It's all right, he's alive. <br>
(Kennedy leaves unnoticed.) <br>
HALL: Where's Ken <br>
DOCTOR: Ken? Ken who? <br>
JAMIE: Make him tell us where the Tardis is! <br>
DOCTOR: No good, he's out cold. See if we can find some water
somewhere. Hello, this is something. This really is something. <br>
(The Doctor has found the money.) <br>
DOCTOR: But why pay him to help steal the Tardis and then knock him on
the head? <br>
JAMIE: Why steal the Tardis anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: That's what's been bothering me, Jamie, too. <br>
JAMIE: There's no water here. Hey, that looks a lot of money, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: It's between two and three hundred pounds. Yes, it is a lot, at
least for what he had to do. Put on a pair of overalls and just hang
around. Come to think of it, why hang around? He was obviously planted.
Why not just go off in the lorry? <br>
JAMIE: You've found something else? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
(There are cigarettes and a matchbook on the windowsill. The Doctor
searches Hall's pockets.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, this man rolled his own cigarettes, so these must belong
to somebody else. That's a fair assumption. <br>
(A train rumbles past over the arches.) <br>
JAMIE: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's only a train. <br>
JAMIE: A what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a train. There are carriages and they go on wheels,
on rails, and they're drawn by a steam. Hey, come back! <br>
(Hall rushes out of the door and fastens it with a metal bar through
the handles.) <br>
JAMIE: Well, give us a hand. <br>
(When Jamie stops pushing the door, the bar falls out and the door
opens.) <br>
JAMIE: Not a sign of him. The only chance we had. <br>
DOCTOR: There is this. (the matchbook) The Tricolour. It's a coffee
bar, apparently. And that's not all. <br>
JAMIE: Well, what else? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to
left. These have been torn out from left to right. <br>
JAMIE: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It means we've got to find a coffee bar called The Tricolour,
and look for a man called Ken or Kenneth someone, who's left-handed. <br>
JAMIE: Now we've got something to go on. <br>
DOCTOR: But it's so little, Jamie. It's too little. He might only have
been there once. There's no guarantee he'll ever go there again. <br>
JAMIE: Now, don't give up Doctor. Remember Bruce. <br>
DOCTOR: Bruce? <br>
JAMIE: Robert Bruce.

WATERFIELD: And they were not aware that you were watching? <br>
KENNEDY: No, they were too busy trying to work it all out. <br>
WATERFIELD: Good. <br>
KENNEDY: That Bob Hall was a bit of a problem. I didn't think he'd turn
nasty. <br>
WATERFIELD: You didn't hurt him? <br>
KENNEDY: Him? You're joking. <br>
WATERFIELD: I can assure you that I am not. <br>
KENNEDY: He's a lot bigger than me, you know. No, I just battered him
one and that was it. <br>
WATERFIELD: That was what, Kennedy? I must know precisely what has
happened. How badly injured was Hall? <br>
KENNEDY: Well, a bit dazed, that's all. He just mumbled something then
made a run for it when they weren't looking. <br>
WATERFIELD: And where is he now? <br>
KENNEDY: Well, I went round to his place later. There he was coming out
the front door, zip bag and everything. He got in a cab and went to
Euston. <br>
WATERFIELD: Were you able to find another hansom and follow him? <br>
KENNEDY: Ay? <br>
WATERFIELD: Did you follow him? <br>
KENNEDY: Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about him. He's gone up north. <br>
WATERFIELD: That disposes of that. Now, this is extremely important.
You did leave the matches? <br>
KENNEDY: Don't worry about it. The Doctor found the cigarettes and the
matches. <br>
WATERFIELD: And you are certain they were the ones bearing the name of
the coffee shop? <br>
KENNEDY: Coffee bar. <br>
WATERFIELD: Yes. <br>
KENNEDY: Yes. I told you, it worked like a charm. I never thought it
would, but you were quite right. He got onto the name on the matches
straight away. <br>
WATERFIELD: Well, just one last thing, to make quite sure. <br>
(Waterfield takes two photographs from a deed box.) <br>
WATERFIELD: Now, you are certain that these are the people that you
saw? <br>
KENNEDY: That's them, yeah. Yeah, definite. <br>
WATERFIELD: Right. Well, I shall want you to keep out of sight. You'd
better stay in the house. And on no account are you to talk to Mister
Perry about any of this. <br>
KENNEDY: Okay. <br>
WATERFIELD: Okay? What does that mean? <br>
KENNEDY: What? Yes! <br>
WATERFIELD: Oh, I know my attitude may appear strange to you on
occasions, Kennedy. <br>
KENNEDY: You want to play the part of the Victorian grandfather, that's
all right by me. Must be a pretty good gimmick. You pay me well enough.
<br>
WATERFIELD: It helps to sell to our customers. <br>
KENNEDY: Yeah, sure, sure. You've never told me what it is exactly
you've got against this Doctor and his friend. Some kind of vendetta or
something? <br>
WATERFIELD: Explanations are not part of our arrangement. <br>
KENNEDY: Oh, just wondering. <br>
WATERFIELD: Imagination is a virtue, but it can become a vice. <br>
KENNEDY: Mind me own business. Yeah. I get the message. <br>
WATERFIELD: Ask Mister Perry to come and see me, will you please? <br>
(Kennedy leaves. Waterfield takes a key from the deed box and goes to
the bookcase. He removes a large volume and puts the key into a hidden
lock. Kennedy is watching from the hallway as the bookcase slides aside
and Waterfield goes into a secret room. He comes out soon after
carrying a large brown-paper parcel. He closes the secret door and puts
it on the desk.) </font></p>

you to perform. <br>
PERRY: Oh, yes? I say, you got a new delivery. <br>
WATERFIELD: Yes. <br>
PERRY: I didn't see it arrive. <br>
WATERFIELD: It was delivered last night. I've only just brought it in
myself. It is for a new customer. <br>
PERRY: Oh, yes? <br>
WATERFIELD: A Doctor Galloway. He's extremely wealthy and an ardent
collector. <br>
PERRY: Of Victoriana, sir? <br>
WATERFIELD: No less. I do not know the Doctor personally, but we have
arranged to meet in the coffee shop, er, bar, nearby. <br>
PERRY: The Tricolour, sir? <br>
WATERFIELD: Yes. Unfortunately, I am unable to keep the appointment, so
I want you to go instead, Mister Perry. Here is a photograph of Doctor
Galloway. This is his assistant and secretary, Mister James McCrimmon.
Now, I want you to ask the Doctor to come to the shop tonight. Say at
ten o' clock? <br>
PERRY: Ten o'clock, sir? <br>
WATERFIELD: Yes. Oh, don't worry, Mister Perry. I shall be attending to
him myself. You needn't wait. <br>
PERRY: Oh, right, sir. <br>
WATERFIELD: The Doctor is notoriously unpunctual. I fear you may have a
long and tedious wait. <br>

secret room again. This area is bright, with a large packing case in
one corner. A carved chair faces the far wall where two metal arms
extend into the room, about four feet off the floor and eight feet
apart. Waterfield adjusts some very un-Victorian equipment and sits in
the chair as the machinery hums.) <br>

DOCTOR: Please do. <br>
MAXTIBLE: I have always been fascinated by the concept of travelling
through time. Waterfield here is an expert in certain technical matters
and I have the money to indulge my whims. Everything you see about you
here was constructed by us two. <br>
DOCTOR: To try to find a way of exploring time? <br>
MAXTIBLE: Yes. Now this is my theory. A mirror reflects an image, does
it not? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
MAXTIBLE: So, you may be standing there, and yet appear to be standing
fifty feet away. Well, following the new investigations twelve years
ago by J Clark Maxwell into electromagnetism and the experiments by
Faraday into static electricity. <br>
DOCTOR: Static? <br>
MAXTIBLE: Correct. Waterfield and I first attempted to refine the image
in the mirror, and then to project it. In here, Doctor, are one hundred
and forty four separate mirrors. <br>
(They are behind a pair of gothic pointed doors.) <br>
WATERFIELD: And each is of polished metal. Each is subjected to
electric charges, all positive. <br>
MAXTIBLE: Like repels like in electricity, Doctor, and so next,
Waterfield and I attempted to repel the image in the mirrors, wherever
we directed. <br>
DOCTOR: You mentioned static electricity. <br>
WATERFIELD: That was our last experiment. Negative and positive
electricity had failed, so we tried static. If only we could have known
the powers we were going to unleash. <br>
DOCTOR: Powers? <br>
WATERFIELD: In the middle of our final test with static, creatures
burst out of the cabinet, invaded the house, took away my daughter. <br>
MAXTIBLE: Oh, my dear fellow. My dear, dear fellow. But we shall win
through now that the Doctor is here. <br>
DOCTOR: These creatures? <br>
WATERFIELD: We had opened the way for them with our experiments. They
forced me into the horror of time travel, Doctor. They ordered me to
steal a box belonging to you and thus lure you into a trap and
transport you here, together with your colleague Mister McCrimmon. <br>
DOCTOR: They knew about me, these creatures. <br>
MAXTIBLE: They gave us likenesses. <br>
WATERFIELD: What could I do? They said my daughter would die. <br>
DOCTOR: What are they called, these creatures? <br>

You will obey! <br>

DALEK: We have your time ship. We will destroy it unless you help us
with an experiment. <br>

DALEK: He is the human being who is to be tested. <br>

DALEK: Silence! You will reveal nothing to your companion. Obey the
Daleks! You are in our power! <br>
(The Dalek goes into the mirrored room.) <br>
DOCTOR: What have you done with your infernal meddling? What is this

WATERFIELD: No. <br>
MAXTIBLE: I believe I do. They, I mean the Daleks, tell me they have
always been defeated by human beings. <br>
DOCTOR: In the long run, yes. <br>
MAXTIBLE: Possibly because of some factor, possessed by human beings <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly. <br>
MAXTIBLE: That is absent in Daleks. <br>

into their race. <br>

trying to rescue Victoria Waterfield. Now, you understand? <br>

help feeling that there's more in this than meets the eye. <br>
DALEK: You have completed the experiment? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the three capsules are nearly ready. <br>
DALEK: Stand in front of the cabinet and speak when you have finished. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I understand. <br>
DALEK: Doctor, be careful. <br>
(The Dalek goes back into the mirrored room.) <br>
WATERFIELD: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
WATERFIELD: You can't. You mustn't do it. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
WATERFIELD: You must stop the experiment. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you should have thought of that some time ago. <br>
WATERFIELD: I know. <br>
DOCTOR: It's no use having a conscience now. <br>
WATERFIELD: But before it's too late. <br>
DOCTOR: It was too late when they took away your daughter. It was too
late when you stole my Tardus and lured me to this house and this
century. <br>
WATERFIELD: Yes, but what are we doing? What are we really doing?
Turning these creatures into super-beings. <br>
DOCTOR: Homo superiense. <br>
WATERFIELD: Adding all that is best and finest in human nature to all
that is brilliant and superior in them. They'll be unbeatable. <br>
DOCTOR: That is their purpose. <br>
WATERFIELD: But you're making over the whole world to them. Don't you
realise that? Our world, our future. They will enslave us for all time.
<br>
DOCTOR: That, Mister Waterfield, remains to be seen. <br>
(The Doctor turns back to his work. Waterfield sees the metal bar that
Kemel bent and picks it up. The Doctor grabs his arm before he can
strike.) <br>
DOCTOR: Attacking me will do no good. Now listen. You've done all of
this because of your daughter. Jamie is with her now and they're both
still in the power of the Daleks. They must be set free! <br>
WATERFIELD: And sacrifice a whole world. A history, past, present and
future? Destroy an entire race? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I don't think you quite realise what you're saying. But
yes, it may come to that. It may very well come to that.

forward, Kemel and I were able to tiptoe up behind him, throw the rope
over his head and throw him into the fire. <br>
(Kemel gestures at the packing cases barricading the door. Liquid is
coming in underneath them.) <br>
VICTORIA: What are they doing? <br>
JAMIE: They must be trying to get through. You'd better stand back,
Miss Waterfield. <br>
VICTORIA: Why not break the door down? They're strong enough. <br>
JAMIE: I don't know. Maybe they want us alive. I just don't know. Is it
hot? Aye, well, there's no smoke. It could be one of their newfangled
inventions trying to melt their way through. Look, you'd better stand
right back. Why didn't they try before this, is what I don't
understand. Anyway, we'll make it as hard for them as we possibly can.
Come on, Kemel. Excuse me. Take this. That's it. That one too. <br>
(The men pile more boxes around the door. A panel in the wall slides
open behind Victoria and Terrall enters.) <br>
JAMIE: What's puzzling me is, there were two on the way up here, and
there was a Dalek up here. And you were up <br>
(Terrall pulls Victoria into the secret passage and the door closes.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, Miss Waterfield! <br>
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie! <br>
JAMIE: Hey, did you hear it? Of course! Why didn't I use my head?
There's another way in and out of here. Come on! <br>

crumble. They open the panel and escape just before the Daleks break
in.)

JAMIE: Right. Where's Victoria Waterfield? <br>
TERRALL: You'll never find her. <br>

DOCTOR: Do you want to save this man's life? <br>
RUTH: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you? <br>
RUTH: Yes! <br>

get the carriage round to the stables. You go too, Mollie. We'll bring
him out you. Now go along. <br>
RUTH: But, Doctor Oh, Mollie. <br>
(The Doctor finds a slim black box inside Terrall's jacket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought he was under some sort of control. Come along. <br>
TERRALL: The creatures. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, don't worry about them. <br>
TERRALL: There's danger, I tell you. Some kind of danger. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know there's danger. You must leave here immediately. <br>
TERRALL: The house, the creatures abroad. <br>

waiting for you at the stables. <br>
TERRALL: Yes, very well. <br>

(The Daleks gather round a swivel chair and play at pushing it.
Maxtible enters and likes what he sees.) <br>
MAXTIBLE: Every feeling, every thought impulse you had during your
attempt to rescue Victoria Waterfield, was recorded and made into a
small positronic brain and added to these Daleks. The human factor to
add to their own powers, to triumph over human beings. <br>
JAMIE: Well, how do you know they haven't succeeded? <br>
DOCTOR: Because human beings, Jamie, no matter how brilliant they may
be, are always within reach of other human beings. Now then, it's all
right, Jamie, don't worry. <br>
JAMIE: How do you know you can trust them, Doctor? <br>

gold. That's what the Daleks are going to give me. Now do you begin to
understand? The secret of the transmutation of metal into gold. <br>

MAXTIBLE: But, the secret. If you destroy my laboratory, the secret is
useless. You promised me. They must be out of their minds. Destroy my

on your planet! <br>
