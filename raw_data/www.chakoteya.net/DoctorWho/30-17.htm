[OC]: It is said that in the final days of planet Earth, everyone had
bad dreams. To the west of the north of that world, the human race did
gather, in the celebration of a pagan rite to banish the cold and the
dark. Each and every one of those people had dreamt of the terrible
things to come. But they forgot, because they must. They forgot their
nightmares of fire and war and insanity. They forgot. Except for one.

head.) <br>
MASTER [OC]: Bwahahahahahaha! <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Wilf goes inside the nearest church, where a choir
is rehearsing. He notices a strange blue rectangle in the stained glass
window above the altar. A woman dressed in a white suit makes him
jump.) <br>
WOMAN: They call it the Legend of the Blue Box. <br>
WILF: Oh. I've never been in here before. I'm not one for churches. Too
cold. <br>
WOMAN: This was the site of a convent back in the thirteen hundreds.
It's said a demon fell from the sky, then a man appeared. A man in a
blue box. They called him the sainted physician. He smote the demon and
then disappeared. <br>
WILF: That's a bit of a coincidence. <br>
WOMAN: It's said there's no such thing as coincidence. Who knows?
Perhaps he's coming back. <br>
WILF: Oh, that would make my Christmas. <br>
(The woman has disappeared. Wilf hears the laughter again.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis materialises in the snowy landscape,
and the Doctor steps out wearing a stetson and a lei. Ood Sigma is
waiting for him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Now, sorry. There you are. So, where were we? I was
summoned, wasn't I? An Ood in the snow, calling to me. Well, I
didn't exactly come straight here. Had a bit of fun, you know.
Travelled about, did this and that. Got into trouble. You know me. It
was brilliant. I saw the Phosphorous Carousel of the Great Magellan
Gestadt, saved a planet from the Red Carnivorous Maw, named a galaxy
Alison. Got married. That was a mistake. Good Queen Bess. And let me
tell you, her nickname is no longer. Ahem. Anyway, what do you want? <br>
SIGMA: You should not have delayed. <br>
DOCTOR: The last time I was here you said my song would be ending soon,
and I'm in no hurry for that. <br>
SIGMA: You will come with me. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on. Better lock the Tardis. <br>
(The Doctor points a remote key at the Tardis. The door locks and the
light flashes at it beeps.) <br>
DOCTOR: See? Like a car. I locked it like a car. Like. It's funny. No?
Little bit? Blimey, try to make an Ood laugh. So how old are you now,
Ood Sigma? Ah. <br>
(He sees the Ood city.) <br>
DOCTOR: Magnificent. Oh, come on, that is splendid. You've achieved all
this in how long? <br>
SIGMA: One hundred years. <br>
DOCTOR: Then we've got a problem. Because all of this is way too fast.
Not just the city, I mean your ability to call me. Reaching all the way
back to the twenty first century. Something's accelerating your species
way beyond normal. <br>
SIGMA: And the Mind of the Ood is troubled. <br>
DOCTOR: Why, what's happened? <br>
SIGMA: Every night, Doctor, every night we have bad dreams. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sitting in a circle in an ice cave.)<br>
ELDER: Returning, returning, returning, it is slowly returning through
the dark and the fire and the blood. Always returning, returning to
this world. It is returning, and he is returning, and they are
returning, but too late. Too late. Far too late. He has come. <br>
SIGMA: Sit with the Elder of the Ood and share the dreaming. <br>
DOCTOR: So. Right. Hallo. <br>
OOD: You will join. You will join. You will join. You will join. You
will join. You will join. You will join. <br>
(The Doctor links hands with the Ood and sees the laughing face.) <br>
MASTER [OC]: Bwahahahahahaha! <br>
ELDER: He comes to us every night. I think all the peoples of the
universe dream of him now. <br>
DOCTOR: That man is dead. <br>
ELDER: There is yet more. Join us. Events are taking shape. So many
years ago, and yet changing the now. There is a man <br>
MASTER [OC]: Bwahahahahahaha! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: What about Donna, is she safe? <br>
ELDER: You should not have delayed, for the lines of convergence are
being drawn across the Earth. Even now, the king is in his Counting
house. <br>
(The Doctor is given images of a black man and his daughter being
photographed.) <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know who they are. <br>
ELDER: And there is another. The most lonely of all, lost and
forgotten. <br>
(A woman in a cage.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Master's wife. <br>
SIGMA: We see so much, but understand little. The woman in the cage,
who is she? <br>
DOCTOR: She was. It wasn't her fault, she was. The Master, he's a Time
Lord, like me. I can show you. <br>
(The Doctor shows the Ood images from Last of the Time Lords.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Master took the name of Saxon. He married a human, a woman
called Lucy. And he corrupted her. She stood at his side while he
conquered the Earth. I reversed everything he'd done so it never even
happened, but Lucy Saxon remembered. I held him in my arms. I burnt his
body. The Master is dead. <br>
ELDER: And yet, you did not see. <br>
DOCTOR: What's that? <br>
MASTER [OC]: Bwahahahahahaha! <br>
(A woman picking up the Master's signet ring.) <br>
DOCTOR: Part of him survived. I have to go! <br>
ELDER: But something more is happening, Doctor. The Master is part of a
greater design, because a shadow is falling over creation. Something
vast is stirring in the dark. The Ood have gained this power to see
through time, because time is bleeding. Shapes of things once lost are
moving through the veil, and these events from years ago threaten to
destroy this future, and the present, and the past. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
ELDER: This is what we have seen, Doctor. The darkness heralds only one
thing. <br>
OOD: The end of time itself. <br>
MASTER [OC]: Bwahahahahahaha! <br>
(The Doctor runs outside and back to the Tardis.) <br>
ELDER: Events that have happened are happening now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(While the Tardis is in flight, Lucy Saxon is taken
from her cell and escorted by women Prison Officers. to meet a another
woman.) <br>
GOVERNOR: Mrs Saxon. Let me introduce myself. I'm your new Governor.
I'm afraid the previous Governor met with something of an accident,
which took quite some time to arrange. Miss Trefusis, if you will
prepare. You kept your silence well, Mrs Saxon. Your trial was held in
secret, with no jury, so no one knows who Harold Saxon was, where he
came from, why you killed him. Make her kneel. There are those of us
who never lost faith. And in his wisdom, Harold Saxon prepared for this
moment. He knew that he might die and he made us ready. Tonight, Mrs
Saxon, he returns. <br>
MASTER [OC]: Bwahahahahahaha! <br>
(Miss Trefusis holds out the Master's signet ring. Lucy gasps. <br>
Meanwhile, Wilf is looking out at the kitchen window at the storm while
the Woman in White briefly appears on the TV screen in the other room.)
<br>
GOVERNOR: As it was written in the Secret Books of Saxon, these are the
Potions of Life. <br>
(The signet ring is put into a bowl and blue liquids are poured over
it.) <br>
LUCY: Listen to me. Whatever he told you, you've got no idea what
you're doing. <br>
GOVERNOR: Miss Trefusis, the catalyst. <br>
LUCY: What are you doing? Leave me alone! <br>
(Miss Trefusis takes a print of Lucy's lips.) <br>
GOVERNOR: You were Saxon's wife. You bore his imprint. That's all we
needed. The final biometrical signature. <br>
LUCY: You can't bring him back. You can't! <br>
(Miss Trefusis drops the imprint into the bowl and there is a big
flash, then a light beams up and out of Broadfell Prison into the sky.)
<br>
LUCY: I'm begging you! Stop this now before it's too late! <br>
GOVERNOR: We give ourselves that Saxon might live. <br>
(Energy is pulled out of the Governor and her acolytes.) <br>
LUCY: Can't you see? He lied to you. His name isn't even Harold Saxon. <br>
GOVERNOR: And this was written also, for his name is the Master! <br>
(The figure of the naked Master begins to appear in the column of
light.) <br>
MASTER: Never. Never. Never. Never. Never dying. Never dying! Never
dying! Never dying! Never dying!
Bwahahahahahaha! Oh, Lucy. Sweet Lucy Saxon. My ever faithful. Did the
widow's kiss bring me back to life? <br>
LUCY: You're killing them! <br>
MASTER: Oh, let them die. They're just the first. The whole stupid,
stinking, human disgrace can fall into the pit. Can't you hear it,
Lucy? The noise?
The drumbeat louder than ever before. The drums. The never ending
drums. Oh, I have missed them. <br>
LUCY: But no-one knew you better than I did. I knew you'd come back.
And all this time, your disciples have prepared. But so have we. <br>
(Lucy takes a small vial from a prison officer who was not an acolyte.)
<br>
MASTER: What are you doing? <br>
LUCY: The Secret Books of Saxon spoke of the Potions of Life. And I was
never that bright, but my family had contacts. People who were clever
enough to calculate the opposite. <br>
MASTER: Don't you dare. I'm ordering you, Lucy. You will obey me! <br>
LUCY: Till death do us part, Harry! <br>
MASTER: No! <br>
(Lucy throws the vial at the Master and there is an explosion. <br>
The Doctor runs out of the Tardis to see the ruined shell of Broadfell
Prison.)

TOMMO: They're saying that the Presidents got this grand plan. He's
going to save the world with some big financial scheme. Whatever it is,
I bet it won't reach you and me. <br>

MASTER: Starving. <br>
(The Master devours the burger far too rapidly for a human.) <br>
TOMMO: Now, you see? That's what you don't want to do. Eat it all at
once. Tempting, I know. But if you make it last, it can last all day. <br>
MASTER: Want more. Want cheese and chips, and meat and gravy, and cream
and beer, and pork and beef and fat. Great big chunks of hot, wet red. <br>
TOMMO: Good for you, mate. Maybe we'd better be going. <br>
GINGER: You look like that bloke. Harold Saxon? The one that went mad. <br>
MASTER: Now isn't that funny. Isn't that just the best thing of all.
The master of disguise, stuck looking like the old Prime Minister. I
can't hide anywhere. He can see me. He can smell me. Can't let him
smell me. Doctor, Doctor, shocked her, stopped her, got to stop the
smell. The stink. The filthy, filthy stink. <br>
TOMMO: Ginger, come with me. Right now. <br>
MASTER: Because it's funny. Don't you see? Look at me. I'm splitting my
sides. <br>

MASTER: Dinnertime! <br>
(The Master leaps up into the sky then swoops down on the two men. They
scream, briefly. <br>
A little later, the Doctor stands on a small cliff and sniffs deeply.
The Master does the same, then picks up an iron bar and starts hitting
an oil drum in a rhythm of four beats and a rest. The Doctor hears it
and runs through piles of girders on the dockside until he sees the
Master up against the skyline. The Master does his Incredible Hulk
impression then leaps into the air. The Doctor gives chase. The Master
waits for him on a pile of girders, and his skeleton briefly flashes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Please, let me help. You're burning up your own life force. <br>

of the Silver Cloak close behind.) <br>
WILF: Oh, my gosh, Doctor. You're a sight for sore eyes. <br>
DOCTOR: Out of my way! <br>
(But the Master is nowhere to be seen.) <br>
WINSTON: Did we do it? Is that him? <br>
OLIVER: Tall and thin, big brown coat. <br>
MINNIE: The Silver Cloak. It worked. Because Wilf phoned Netty, who
phoned June, and her sister lives opposite Broadfell, and she saw the
police box, and her neighbour saw this man heading east. <br>
DOCTOR: Wilfred? <br>
WILF: Yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Have you told them who I am? You promised me. <br>
WILF: No, I just said you were a doctor, that's all. And might I say,
sir, it is an honour to see you again. <br>

MINNIE: Oh, but you never said he was a looker. He's gorgeous. Take a

OLIVER: Not bad, eh? Me next. <br>
MINNIE: I'm Minnie. Minnie the Menace. It's a long time since I had a

MINNIE; Hush, you old misery. Come on, Doctor. Give us a smile. That's

MINNIE: No, there's a blue light. Try again. <br>

prophecy. Knock four times, and then <br>
WILF: Yeah, but I thought, when I saw you before, you said your people
could change, like, your whole body. <br>
DOCTOR: I can still die. If I'm killed before regeneration, then I'm
dead. Even then, even if I change, it feels like dying. Everything I am
dies. Some new man goes sauntering away, and I'm dead. What? <br>

WILF: I'm sorry, but I had to. Look, can't you make her better? <br>

just go to her now. Go on, just run across the street. Go up and say
hello. <br>

like a tourist spot. <br>
WILF: No, it's Temple-Noble. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Is she happy? Is he nice? <br>
WILF: Yeah, he's sweet enough. He's a bit of a dreamer. Mind you, he's
on minimum wage, she's earning tuppence, so all they can afford is a
tiny little flat. And then sometimes I see this look on her face, like
she's so sad, but she can't remember why. <br>

took their final places, making ready the events that were to come. The
madman sat in his empire of dust and ashes, little knowing of the glory
he would achieve. While his saviour looked upon the wilderness, in the
hope of changing his inevitable fate. Far away, the idiots and fools
dreamt of a shining new future. A future now doomed to never happen. As
Earth rolled onwards into night, the people of that world did sleep,

of meat, and flesh, and grease, and juice, and baking, burnt, sticky
