<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STEVEN: We're landing now Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. That means the gravitational bearing must have rectified
itself. <br>
(DODO enters.) <br>
DODO: Hey, look at this! <br>
(Dodo has raided the ship's wardrobe for a trendy new dress. <br>
DODO: Ain't it fab? <br>
STEVEN: Yes, very nice. <br>
(The Doctor sneezes.) <br>
STEVEN: Bless you. <br>
DODO: Oh Doctor, don't say you're catching a cold now. <br>
(But as the young friends turn towards the Doctor, he's nowhere to be
seen.) <br>
STEVEN: Doctor? Well, where are you? <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, dear boy? I'm still here. <br>
STEVEN: What? <br>
DODO: Doctor, you've vanished! <br>
DOCTOR: What? Oh, nonsense, child. Nonsense. <br>
DODO: You have. Do you think this is something to do with the
Refusians? <br>
STEVEN: Well, it must be. <br>
DOCTOR: You're wrong. This is something far more serious. We're in
grave danger. This is some form of attack! <br>
STEVEN: But we're still in the Tardis! <br>
DOCTOR: That may be, my boy, but wherever it is, it has great power and
can penetrate our safety barrier. <br>
(The Tardis has materialised in the centre of an empty octagonal room.)
<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Don't just stand there, dear boy, turn on the scanner. <br>
DODO: But Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Don't ask questions, child. There isn't time. Turn on the
scanner. <br>
STEVEN: It isn't working. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, it is. When it isn't working, the screen is not as
clear as that. This is part of the same trick. <br>
DODO: But what are we to do? Let's take off at once. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: That might be worse, my dear. Besides, I'm not only
invisible, I'm intangible, which means that I can't pull the switches. <br>
STEVEN: Well, I'll do it if you tell me what to do. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: No! Whatever it is, we shall have to face up to it. Open
the doors. <br>
STEVEN: But, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Open the doors! <br>
(Reluctantly, Steven obeys.) <br>
DODO: We should go. <br>
STEVEN: We can't. <br>
DODO: Hey, if the Doctor's intangible, why did he need to open the
doors? He could have just walked through them. <br>
STEVEN: Habit, I suppose. Come on, we should follow. <br>
DODO: You won't get me out there. <br>
(Steven steps outside.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In a striking office a man is dressed in the
bejewelled robes of a Chinese Mandarin. His surroundings, a strange
mixture of ultramodern and ornate, include a large desk incorporating a
control panel and an elegant triangular gaming table. Everyone say Hi!
to the wonderful <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001284/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Michael
Gough</a>.)<br>
TOYMAKER: You'll serve my purpose admirably. You're very good at games.
Clowns always are. You can show Steven and Dodo some of your tricks
into the bargain. <br>
(The man has selected a pair of toy clowns, one happy and one sad, from
the nursery of a large Victorian dolls house. The happy one is a girl
dressed in a harlequin costume. The sad one is a boy in a white baggy
suit with ruffles and a cone-shaped clown hat. Now, before his eyes,
the dolls begin to grow.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Toyroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DODO: If you want to go, then you go, but I'm sure
that the Doctor would. Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? What is it? <br>
DODO: There you are! <br>
STEVEN: We can see you! Everything's all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you can see me? <br>
STEVEN + DODO: Yes! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, splendid. Splendid. <br>
DODO: Oh, let's go now. It must have just been the Refusian influence
after all. <br>
STEVEN: What's this extraordinary place? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not quite sure, dear boy, but it's, it's somewhat
familiar. <br>
DODO: It looks dead boring to me. Come on. <br>
DOCTOR: No, wait, child, wait. <br>
DODO: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don't think it was the Refusian's influence that made
me become intangible. No, I think it was something here, and I don't
like the feel of the place anymore than you do but we have to face up
to it. You know, I think I was meant to come here. <br>
STEVEN: Hey! Look! That's me! <br>
DODO: What is? <br>
STEVEN: Here, on this screen! <br>
DODO: What screen? <br>
STEVEN: Here! That's me on the planet Kemble. <br>
(To Dodo the screen is blank.) <br>
DODO: There's nothing there. <br>
DOCTOR: But I believe I now know where we are. <br>
STEVEN: It's changed again. There I am in Paris. <br>
DOCTOR: Now turn around this instant! Turn away from it, dear boy!
We're now in the world of The Celestial Toymaker, and that screen is
hypnotic. He's trying to dominate your mind. <br>
STEVEN: But, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: There is nothing there. Do you understand me? There is nothing
there at all. You must believe me. <br>
STEVEN: What was it? What happened? <br>
DODO: What's the matter, Doctor? I couldn't see anything on the screen.
<br>
DOCTOR: Come here, child. Now whatever you do, you must not allow
yourself to be trapped into looking at it. <br>
DODO: Who's the Celestial Toymaker? <br>
DOCTOR: He's a power for evil. He manipulates people and makes them
into his playthings. Whatever you do, neither of you must look at that
screen. It's a trap. <br>
(In place of the Tardis now stands the Mandarin.) <br>
TOYMAKER: What a spoil-sport you are, Doctor. They like my memory
window. <br>
DOCTOR: You! I might have guessed. <br>
TOYMAKER: Of course. I've been waiting for you a long time. <br>
DODO: Where's the Tardis? <br>
TOYMAKER: Don't worry, my dear. Just watch over there. <br>
(As Dodo looks at the screen, an image appears of a young girl wearing
a school beret.) <br>
DODO: It's me the day my mother died! <br>
DOCTOR: Turn away from it this instant! <br>
STEVEN: Look away. <br>
(Steven pulls Dodo to himself.) <br>
TOYMAKER: What a shame. I thought my little invention would amuse you. <br>
DOCTOR: You and your inventions, ha! Now, both of you, be very careful.
This place is a hidden menace. Nothing is just for fun. <br>
STEVEN: What's the idea of it? <br>
DOCTOR: He's trying to get us into his power. That's why we've got to
fight him. <br>
DODO: Well can't we just go? I hate this place. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear, but how? That is the question. <br>
DODO: In the Tardis, of course, as always. <br>
TOYMAKER: There are many of them. Take your choice. <br>
(On screen, rows of Tardises are filing past as if on a conveyor belt.)
<br>
STEVEN: There are hundreds of them! <br>
TOYMAKER: Yes, hundreds. Come, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
(Steven and Dodo turn round. The room is completely empty.) <br>
STEVEN: Doctor! <br>
DODO: Have you gone invisible again? <br>
STEVEN: No, he's gone. That man has taken him away. <br>
DODO: I don't like it. We should never have stayed. <br>
STEVEN: It's too late now. <br>
DODO: Who was that man? <br>
STEVEN: I don't know. But we've got to find the Doctor. <br>
(The only door in the room suddenly opens and two clowns enter the room
on tiptoe.) <br>
STEVEN: What on Earth? <br>
DODO: Shhh! Shhh! Steven. <br>
STEVEN: But why have I got to be quiet? <br>
(Joey, the sad clown offers Steven his hand which comes away in
Steven's own, as Clara, the happy clown pops a balloon with a hat pin.
The newcomers mime convulsive laughter. Dodo giggles.) <br>
STEVEN: Very funny. Don't see what you've got to laugh about. <br>
DODO: If you could only see your face with that hand. <br>
(Joey presents Dodo with a bouquet.) <br>
DODO: For me? (honk) Oh thanks. No one's ever given me flowers before. <br>
(As she leans in to smell them, a jet of water squirts in her face.
It's Steven's turn to be amused.) <br>
STEVEN: If you could just see your face. <br>
DODO: I'm not sure that I like these clowns. <br>
STEVEN: Look, can either of you talk? (honk) Well, how about you? <br>
CLARA: (very high pitched) Yes, I can talk. How are you? <br>

<br>
STEVEN: I'm fine. But what do you want with us? <br>
TOYMAKER: They're here to entertain you. Play a game with you. <br>
STEVEN: Well, thank you very much. We've been entertained. We don't
want to play your games. Now where have you taken the Doctor? <br>
TOYMAKER: Taken the Doctor? Nowhere, my dear chap. The Doctor and I are
going to play a little game together. You can watch the results on that
board. <br>
(He points to the screen.) <br>
TOYMAKER: But you must win all your games before he does. <br>
STEVEN: Look, we're not interested in your games. We want to go back to
the Tardis. <br>
TOYMAKER: That's impossible. <br>
STEVEN: Impossible? <br>
TOYMAKER: Well, not quite impossible, but you'll have to win a few
games first. After each game, if you win, you will find a Tardis, which
may or may not be the real one. <br>
STEVEN: What do you mean, the real one? <br>
TOYMAKER: As you have seen, I have many copies. <br>
DODO: So we have to win a game before we can get to the Tardis. <br>
TOYMAKER: Right. Several games, in fact. <br>
STEVEN: And if we lose? <br>
TOYMAKER: Then you both stay here as my guests. <br>
DODO: We'd better play his silly games, Steven. <br>
STEVEN: I don't see why we should humour him. He's obviously around the
bend. <br>
DODO: That's just it. If we don't do as he says, we may never get out
of here. <br>
TOYMAKER: Well? <br>
STEVEN: All right, we'll play your little games. But if we win, we get
the Tardis back, okay? <br>
TOYMAKER: Agreed. <br>
STEVEN: And if we lose? <br>
TOYMAKER: You'll never see the Tardis again. <br>
(The Toymaker vanishes.) <br>
STEVEN: Wait! <br>
DODO: You never asked him about the Doctor. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, he's probably got his game to play. I'm glad we're not
playing that one. <br>
DODO: What are we playing? <br>
CLARA: Blind Man's Buff!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Toymaker's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Toymaker and the Doctor face each other across
the triangular table.) <br>
DOCTOR: You will kindly cease this practical joking, and let us go at
once. <br>
TOYMAKER: Patience, Doctor, patience. You've only just got here. Relax.
It's so nice to see you again. <br>
DOCTOR: And now you have, so let us go. <br>
TOYMAKER: You're so innocent, Doctor. The last time you were here, I
hoped you'd stay long enough for a game, but you had hardly time to
turn around. <br>
DOCTOR: And very wise I was, too. You and your games are quite
notorious. You draw people here like a spider does to flies. <br>
TOYMAKER: How absurd. It amuses me to give amusement. <br>
DOCTOR: And should they lose the game they play, you condemn them to
become your toy forever. <br>
TOYMAKER: That is one of my rules, certainly. But if they win, they're
perfectly free to go. <br>
DOCTOR: And if I refuse? <br>
TOYMAKER: Then you lose by default. Is that what you choose? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I do not. I should never have left the Tardis. <br>
TOYMAKER: You're so insatiably curious. That's why I ensured that the
scanner would be blank. I knew that would bring you out. <br>
DOCTOR: Another one of your conjuring tricks. What game is it you want
me to play? <br>
(The Toymaker indicates the table.) <br>
TOYMAKER: This. <br>
(Each of the three corners is inlaid with a letter, A B and C.) <br>
DOCTOR: The trilogic game? <br>
TOYMAKER: The trilogic game. A game for the mind, Doctor, the developed
mind. Difficult for the practiced mind. Dangerous for the mind that has
become old, lazy or weak. <br>
DOCTOR: You infer that my mind is getting weak and old? <br>
TOYMAKER: Well now, we shall see. Perhaps it is merely lazy. <br>
DOCTOR: How dare you. <br>
TOYMAKER: So you still think that you can pit your mind against mine? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course I can. <br>
TOYMAKER: Good. I hope that the time you have spent dabbling in your
researches round the universe hasn't dulled you. I need you. <br>
DOCTOR: You need me? <br>
TOYMAKER: Yes. I'm bored. I love to play games, but there's no one to
play against. The beings who call here have no minds and so they become
my toys. But you will become my perpetual opponent. We shall play
endless games together, your brain against mine. <br>
DOCTOR: As you said, if I win the game, I can go. <br>
TOYMAKER: So you can, Doctor, so you can. But I think you will lose.
Can you remember how to play? <br>
(Ten triangular playing counters stacked in a pyramid now appear on
corner A, with number 1, the smallest, at the top.) <br>
DOCTOR: I am only allowed to move one piece at a time. <br>
TOYMAKER: That is right. And you must rearrange them in the same order
that they are now on point C. <br>
DOCTOR: And I am not permitted to put a larger piece on a small piece. <br>
TOYMAKER: Correct. And you have 1,023 moves to do it in. That is the
exact amount. If you make one mistake, you lose. And to help you count,
there. <br>
(He indicates a tally recorder.) <br>
TOYMAKER: When the two rows of numbers match, the game is over. <br>
(The top row reads 1023, the bottom 0.) <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Can I begin? <br>
TOYMAKER: Don't be so impatient, Doctor. <br>
(He points to a monitor on the wall.) <br>
TOYMAKER&gt; There. We mustn't forget them. <br>
DOCTOR: You are not asking them to play this game. <br>
TOYMAKER: Good heavens, no. They are on the competitive quest. <br>
DOCTOR: Competitive? And who are the others? <br>
TOYMAKER: Two clown friends of mine. They are the home team. They will
play against your friends and win the quest. <br>
DOCTOR: Quest? What quest? <br>
TOYMAKER: The hunt for the Tardis. Win the games, and you get it back.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Toyroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Thanks to the efforts of the two clowns, the floor
of the toyroom now resembles a huge board game with a series of
obstacles laid out between Start and Home.) <br>
DODO: It's rather like a Snakes and Ladders set I used to have. <br>
STEVEN: Looks crazy to me. <br>
DODO: Oh, go on, have a go. It looks fun. <br>
STEVEN: What, me on that? Not on your life. <br>
DODO: But this is the game we have to play, right? <br>
CLARA: This is your game. <br>
STEVEN: Right, then you play it. <br>
CLARA: Oh no! You must play it. It's all quite simple. You start here,
blindfold. <br>
STEVEN: You must be joking. Kids game. <br>
DODO: Steven! Go on. <br>
CLARA: You have to cross these obstacles without falling down. And if
you get home without falling down, you win the game. <br>
STEVEN: And what's old What's-His-Name there going to be doing all this
time? <br>
CLARA: His name is Joey. I'm Clara. He will play it too, of course. <br>
STEVEN: And if he loses? No answer that time. And what happens if we
both manage it? <br>
CLARA: Then we play it again until someone loses. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, it's a great future the Toymaker's got mapped out for us.
All right, chum, you want to show me how it's done? (honk, bell, honk,
bell) That means yes, I suppose. (honk) <br>
(Clara ties a blindfold over Joey's eyes and guides him onto the start
position. The first obstacle is a set of pinnacles over which Joey must
swing on a rope.) <br>
CLARA: You must come with me. <br>
(She leads Steven and Dodo into a glass-fronted booth. Inside is a
control panel.) <br>
CLARA: This is where we control them. One buzz for right turn, two for
left, three to stop, four to start. <br>
(Buzz buzz buzz buzz. Joey feels for the rope, unties it and swings
across the pinnacles, landing
sure-footedly on the first of a series of stepping stones, the second
obstacle. He steps confidently from one stone to the next.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Watching the monitor alone, the Doctor finds a
communication switch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Dodo? Steven? This is the Doctor. The game you're going to play
is not so innocent as it looks. Be on your guard. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOYMAKER: That was unwise of you, Doctor. <br>
(The Toymaker's flicked the switch.) <br>
DOCTOR: I must warn them. <br>
TOYMAKER: Attend to your own game. Go from move 152. <br>
(Seemingly of their own volition, the counters and tally move as the
Toymaker has commanded.) <br>
TOYMAKER: Keep playing, Doctor. And to stop you interfering, I shall
have to dematerialise you again. There. <br>
(Once again, the Doctor is intangible.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: You are overreaching yourself, Toymaker. How can I play
this game? <br>
TOYMAKER: Let's see. Suppose we leave you one hand, there. I suggest
you resume the game. <br>
(The Doctor's disembodied hand hovers over the table. With great
dignity he takes counter 1 from B and places it on C, then moves
counter 2 from B to A.)<br>
TOYMAKER: I thought you'd see it my way, Doctor.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Toyroom]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Joey has completed the third and fourth obstacles,
and reaches Home.) <br>
CLARA: We won! We won! <br>
STEVEN: Just a minute. I haven't had a go yet. <br>
DODO: But the Doctor warned us. <br>
STEVEN: It's all right, I can manage it. Rope, five stones, steps,
plank, tube. Now I can do it if you can guide me. After all, he can do
it. And you remember the directions? <br>
DODO: Right, one buzz. Left, two buzzes. Four to start and three to
stop. <br>
(Leaving Dodo in the booth, Steven positions himself at the start of
the course. Clara ties on his blindfold.) <br>
CLARA: Can you see? <br>
STEVEN: Not a thing. Right, I'm ready. <br>
(Clara joins Dodo whilst Joey hovers nonchalantly around the course.) <br>
CLARA: Ready now. <br>
(Buzz buzz buzz buzz. As Steven prepares to rope swing across to the
stepping stones, Joey nudges the first stone out of position.) <br>
DODO: Look what he's doing! Cheat! You cheat! Steven, look out! <br>
CLARA: He can't hear you! The door's self-locking! <br>
(Buzz buzz buzz.) <br>
STEVEN: Dodo, be careful. You nearly made me fall that time. <br>
(Steven swings across but his feet find nothing on the other side.) <br>
STEVEN: What have you done now, you clown, you? <br>
(Honk, buzz) <br>
STEVEN: One right. One right? <br>
(He swings again, this time landing safely.) <br>
STEVEN: Phew, that was close. (honk) Yes, you'll honk when I get this
blindfold off. Now he's moved another. He moved the first to the right,
he's moved the second to the left. <br>
(Buzz buzz buzz.) <br>
STEVEN: No, what now? (buzz) To the right? (honk) You wait! <br>
(With Joey continuing to disrupt the course, Steven is forced to listen
carefully to Dodo's signals as he gingerly
negotiates the other stones. Buzz buzz. Buzz. Buzz. Eventually Steven
steps off the final stone onto a stepladder and sits down to mop his
brow.) <br>
DODO: I don't see how he has a chance of winning if you cheat all the
time. <br>
CLARA: Cheat? Oh no. It's just a few variations. It makes it more fun. <br>
(For the next stage, Steven must cross a plank mounted between two sets
of steps. As he's edging along, Joey tries to distract him.) <br>
STEVEN: What was that? (honk) You again. I warn you! (honk) Games with
clowns. <br>
(He reaches the end and begins to climb down. The final obstacle is a
large flexible tube which he must pass through in order to reach home.
Buzz buzz buzz. Buzz buzz.)
DODO: He's far too big to squeeze through that tube. <br>
CLARA: Joey did. <br>
DODO: But suppose he gets stuck half way, what then? <br>
(Once Steven has entered the tube, Joey drags the other end round to
form a U shape.) <br>
DODO: Look what he's done! It's not fair! <br>
CLARA: He goes back to the start! <br>
DODO: And you think that's fair? Let me out of here! Open the door! <br>
CLARA: I can't! <br>
DODO: Oh, you're just like a doll! A rag doll! I don't think this funny
at all. <br>
(Emerging from the end of the tube, Steven feels for the table marking
Home. Instead, he finds the steps again.) <br>
STEVEN: Oh, no! <br>
(He tears off the blindfold.) <br>
STEVEN: Look, I warned you! <br>
CLARA: We won! We won! <br>
DODO: You cheated. Steven completed the course. <br>
CLARA: We won! Now you'll never find the Tardis! <br>
STEVEN: Look, it's a draw. Now let's do it again, this time with him in
the booth! <br>
CLARA: The winner! <br>
DODO: Steven, look at this! You can see right through it. It's not a
real blindfold at all! <br>
(The two clowns look crestfallen.) <br>
STEVEN: No wonder you were able to run round the course so easily. And
now we'll try it again, only this time with a real blindfold. Not so
fast! Here, put that on him. You'd better go in the booth to guide him.
<br>
(Clara obeys whilst Dodo ties the genuine blindfold round Joey's head.
The room has grown darker and the clowns are suddenly sombre.) <br>
STEVEN: Right. Now we'll play The Toymaker's little game fairly. Go on,
Dodo, start him off. <br>
(Buzz buzz buzz buzz. Joey begins the course once again, guided by
Clara's signals.) <br>
DODO: Steven, I'm frightened. Have you noticed he's not funny anymore? <br>
(Buzz buzz. Buzz. Buzz. The clown teeters precariously on the plank.) <br>
DODO: Steven, you'd better stop him. He'll fall. <br>
STEVEN: We can't stop him. It's him or us. Go on. You can't stop now! <br>
(As Joey continues, his movements grow still and slow, until finally he
topples over. In the booth, Clara is slumped lifeless over the
controls. Suddenly all the lights go off, there's a loud thunderclap,
and there illuminated at the far end of the room is the Tardis.) <br>
STEVEN: Come on. <br>
DODO: It can't be empty! <br>
STEVEN: It is. <br>
(There's only a blank cupboard behind the doors.) <br>
STEVEN: Look. <br>
DODO: What's that? <br>
(It's a piece of paper. Dodo reads.) <br>
DODO: Four legs, no feet, of arms no lack, it carries no burden on its
back. Six deadly sisters, seven for choice, call the servants without
voice. What does it mean? <br>
STEVEN: A riddle. Look, here's a way out. <br>
DODO: Perhaps this is to tell us where the Tardis is. <br>
STEVEN: Or perhaps it's just another game. Anyway, we've got to find
out. <br>
(An exit has opened up at the back of the cupboard. Before following

DOCTOR: They'll win, too. <br>
TOYMAKER: No, they will lose one game, and then, like the clowns,
they'll become my toys, and we shall be able to amuse ourselves through

DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
TOYMAKER: You remember the agreement? They must find your Tardis before
you finish your game. If they don't, then you will have to stay here
and you'll be in my power forever. Look, they've already reached their

DOCTOR: That game? I might have known. <br>

TOYMAKER: I'm seriously annoyed with your friend. Once again, he tried
to talk to you, so I've had to deprive him of his voice. Let it be a
warning to you. Play the games according to the rules I set, or give up
now. <br>
STEVEN: The rules you set? Your own players break them. They cheat! <br>
DODO: How can we believe anything you say? Everything here is so
strange. <br>
STEVEN: We can't even be certain that that was the Doctor's voice we
heard at all. It could have been you leading us toward another trap. <br>

DODO: Steven, don't you see who they are? <br>
STEVEN: Well, yes, they do look familiar. <br>
DODO: They're playing cards. We shall play our next game with a couple

STEVEN: The Toymaker's warped sense of humour, I suppose. <br>
QUEEN: None of these look in the least like your throne. <br>
KING: Hmmm? No, no, no, they don't, do we my dear. Although the
Toymaker did say we'd find them in here, didn't he? <br>
STEVEN: What was that riddle again? <br>
DODO: Er, four legs, no feet, of arms no lack, it carries no burden on
its back. <br>
STEVEN: That must be these chairs. <br>

choice, call the servants without voice. <br>
STEVEN: Hmmm. Well that can't be the chairs. There are only three of
them. <br>
QUEEN: You're not paying the least attention again. I warned you, if we
don't find that throne, he'll keep us here. We shall remain playing
cards for the rest of eternity. <br>
KING: Ah! Very good point, my dear. Yes, yes, we must find the throne. <br>
DODO: What do you make of them? They seem almost like real people. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, ignore them. They're sent here to distract us. Let's take a

QUEEN: Where's that Knave? Cyril! Cyril! Tormenting the Joker again

JOKER: Did you have to give him that sword? <br>
QUEEN: Quiet, Fool. Cyril, what are you doing? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven and Dodo have slipped away down a side
passage. They find themselves in a second chair room containing four
more chairs numbered from four to seven. Set into the walls are four
familiar looking cupboards.) <br>
STEVEN: Dodo! Four in here, three in there. It must be the chairs. What
is it? Six deadly sisters, seven for choice. I suppose that means six
of them are dangerous. <br>
DODO: And only one is the right one. <br>
STEVEN: We'll have to find out which one by elimination. But how? And
how dangerous are they? <br>
DODO: No, Steven, don't. <br>
STEVEN: Why? What's wrong? <br>
DODO: Don't risk it. None of the Toymakers' toys are just jokes. Six of
these chairs will destroy us. <br>
STEVEN: It's a charming thought, but you're probably right. But Dodo,
have you noticed all these cupboards? They're all exactly the same
shape as the Tardis. <br>
DODO: Yes, but they could be as dangerous as the chairs. <br>
STEVEN: No, I don't think so. There are only four, and there weren't
any in the other room. <br>
(He opens the first cupboard. Dodo screams.) <br>
STEVEN: It's all right, they're only dolls. <br>
DODO: I've got it. We'll use the dolls to sit in the chairs. If we've
got enough that is. That's four here, and these three make up the
seven. <br>
STEVEN: Don't touch them! <br>
DODO: Why? What's wrong? <br>
STEVEN: Well, they may be dangerous, too. <br>
DODO: But the riddle said six deadly sisters, and some of these are men
dolls. <br>
STEVEN: What was the last line again? <br>
DODO: Erm, call the servants without voice. But you can't call someone
without speaking. <br>
STEVEN: But they haven't got voices. We have. Dolls, come out! Look,
they must be the servants. Maybe it's some poetic term, the call bit. <br>
(When none of the mannequins stir, Steven pulls four of them out onto
the floor.) <br>
STEVEN: Nothing's happened yet. Well, if we can get them all out before
the king and queen get here, we can test the chairs. <br>
DODO: Wait. With seven dolls in three cupboards, what's the other one
for? <br>
STEVEN: Perhaps that might be the real Tardis. <br>
(Whilst they're examining the cupboard the other door slides shut,
leaving three dolls still inside.) <br>
DODO: It won't open. <br>
STEVEN: Of course, the Doctor's got the key. Come on, look! <br>
(He points to a game tally.) <br>
STEVEN: The Doctor's more than half way through his game already. We've
got to find out what we've got to do here first, quick, before the
others arrive. <br>
QUEEN: Ah, the peasants again. Caught you in the act. What are you up
to? <br>
KING: Oh, they seem to be playing with dolls, my dear. <br>
QUEEN: I can see that. The point is, what are they doing with them? <br>
DODO: They seem very real. We're going to use the dolls to test the
chairs. <br>
QUEEN: To test them? <br>
DODO: Yes. Six of them are dangerous and only one is safe. You know, I
feel very foolish talking to a playing card. <br>
QUEEN: A playing card? <br>
DODO: Well, aren't you? <br>
STEVEN: Dodo, it's useless talking to them. They're just products of
the Toymaker's imagination. <br>
QUEEN: We're as real as you are. Henry. <br>
KING: Oh, er, yes, my dear? <br>
QUEEN: Come here. <br>
KING: Yes, my dear. <br>
QUEEN: Let this wretched child feel your arm. <br>
KING: Feel my arm? <br>
QUEEN: There, child. Isn't that an arm? Not much of one, I grant you,
but nevertheless, a real arm. <br>
DODO: It is, Steven, these are real people. Feel his arm. <br>
STEVEN: No, I'll take your word for it. Look, if you're real people,
what are you doing here? And why are you wearing those ridiculous
clothes? <br>
KING: Ah yes, well, it would take a little too long to explain, my boy.
The fact is that we are victims of the Toymaker, the same as you are.
For instance, if I were to sit in this chair. <br>
QUEEN: Henry, no! We don't know. <br>
KING: Oh! Oh, no, no, no, we don't, do we? <br>
QUEEN: We must use the dolls. We'll each choose a doll in turn, and
then we'll take it in turn to test the chairs, that way we'll find the
answer even quicker. <br>
DODO: We found the dolls. They're ours. And we're supposed to be
playing against you. <br>
QUEEN: But that doesn't seem right. There are four dolls and four of
us. We must be meant to have one each. That's only fair. <br>
KING: And then we can test the dolls sitting in the chair before doing
so ourselves?&nbsp;<br>
DODO: What do you mean, one each? What about <br>
STEVEN: It's all right, Dodo.&nbsp;<br>
DODO: Yes, but what about <br>
STEVEN: It'll be all right. Now never mind and keep quiet. All right,
go ahead. Choose your dolls. <br>
DODO: But I don't understand. What about the others? <br>
KING: Oh, no no no, don't fuss yourself, m'dear. The point of the game
is to see who picks the chair which isn't dangerous, and whoever does
that is the winner. If it's you, you'll get your Tardis back, and if it
is us, we get our liberty. <br>
STEVEN: Now, he's right Dodo. Now go on, choose your doll, and keep
quiet. We'll try our luck in the other room. <br>
DODO: Oh, very well. <br>
KING: Oh, are you going, m'dear? <br>
STEVEN: We'll see you later. <br>
QUEEN: I thought we were all supposed to play this game together? <br>
STEVEN: Well as there are seven chairs, I thought that Dodo and I might
try our luck in the other room. That way we'll all have an equal
chance. <br>
KING: Ah, yes, yes, yes, certainly my boy, yes, anything you like. Yes,
well, good luck. <br>
STEVEN: Come on, Dodo. <br>
DODO: All right, I'm just coming. They're so big. <br>
(Armed with a doll each, Steven and Dodo take their leave.) <br>
KING: Charming couple, aren't they? <br>
QUEEN: It isn't very charming to be told you're not real. We were not
amused. Well, which chair do you suggest? <br>
KING: Yes, well, none of them look like the throne, do they m'dear? <br>
QUEEN: Well, then you must pick one at random. <br>
KING: Ah, yes of course, random, yes, yes. Ah, now. <br>
(The King closes his eyes and is about to sit in chair seven.)&nbsp;<br>
KING; Eenie meenie minie moe, catch a nigger by the toe. Ah!&nbsp;<br>
QUEEN: No, Henry! Put the doll in it. <br>
KING: Oh, the doll, yes, quite right, yes, my dear, of course, the
doll. Ah, here we are then. Now then, we'll take the doll and then.
Oof. I say, it's rather heavy, my dear. Nearly as heavy as I am, I've
no doubt that this will be perfectly good test for the <br>

STEVEN: Oh, no. Not more playing cards. <br>
DODO: They look rather sweet, don't they? A Jack and a Joker. <br>
STEVEN: Leave them alone and concentrate. You nearly gave the game away
in the other room. They think that there are only four dolls. Now if
everyone chooses the wrong chair with those dolls, we're going to need
the extra ones to find the right chair. <br>
DODO: Is that fair? They seem quite nice and friendly. <br>
STEVEN: Can't you understand? We've got to win every game, otherwise
we'll never see the Tardis again. This isn't a children's party. <br>
DODO: Well, I'm sure if you explained that then the King and Queen
would help us. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, Dodo, they belong to the Toymaker, remember that. He wants
to keep us here. At any rate, the Doctor. <br>
DODO: Why? <br>
STEVEN: I don't know, and it doesn't matter. But we've got to find the
Tardis before the Doctor finishes the game he's playing. Right. Throw
your doll into a chair. <br>
DODO: Throw it? <br>
STEVEN: Yes. Six of these chairs are deadly, remember that. I don't
want to see either of us caught out by one of those. Now throw it. <br>
DODO: Very well. <br>
(As the doll makes contact with chair number three, there's a blinding
flash.) <br>
DODO: What happened? <br>
STEVEN: It was some sort of electrocution! That could've been us. <br>
DODO: Yes. I see what you mean about this not being a children's party.
<br>
CYRIL: A party? Is it tea time, already? Mmmm, I smell crumpets
toasting. What's that? <br>
DODO: Oh, don't be scared of us. <br>
(Seeing the burnt doll, the awakened Cyril takes flight down the
passageway.) <br>
STEVEN: All right, stand by. I'm going to try chair number one. <br>
(STEVEN throws his doll onto the chair. As it hits, a fearsome blade
shoots across the back of the chair, cutting the toy in two. Part of it
topples to one side and falls to the floor.) <br>
DODO: It's horrible! The Toymaker must be mad! Do you really think he
means to kill us? <br>
STEVEN: What do you think? <br>
DODO: Well, what do we do now? <br>
STEVEN: Well, we've got to get the other dolls. We've got to get out of

the chair slowly fade away.) <br>

six. What do you propose we do now? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOYMAKER: I congratulate you, Doctor, on your
choice of friends. A very astute couple. Neither of my teams have been
able to beat them yet. I think they have earned a little amusement.
Now, what have we here to amuse them? <br>
(The Toymaker selects two figures from the dolls house kitchen.) <br>
TOYMAKER: Ah. Sergeant Rugg and Mrs Wiggs. These then are who Steven
will find behind the door.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven and Dodo are indeed up against a solid
door.) <br>
STEVEN: Useless. No sign of a door handle, latch, or lock. We're stuck
here. <br>
DODO: Steven, the servants, they're following us! <br>
STEVEN: Huh? <br>
DODO: The servants without voice, they've come! They scare me. <br>
STEVEN: They're only dolls. <br>
DODO: We called them. Perhaps we can make them go back to their
cupboard. Dolls, go back. Go back to your cupboard! <br>
STEVEN: I'll stop them. <br>
DODO: Steven, be careful. You don't know what they might do. After all,
we helped destroy the other four dolls. <br>
STEVEN: Perhaps we can edge past them. <br>
(The three dolls spread out across the tunnel.) <br>
DODO: We can't get past them now. <br>
STEVEN: At least they've stopped. I'm going to try. You follow me. <br>
DODO: Look! <br>
(The heavy door has swung open. With the dolls now stock still, Dodo
and Steven edge into the next room. )
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Kitchen]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They find themselves in a large, old-fashioned
kitchen occupied by a ruddy-faced policeman and a
familiar looking household cook.) <br>
STEVEN: Be careful, Dodo, it might be a trap. <br>
RUGG: A trap? In here? In Mrs Wiggs' kitchen? Hey, you want to watch
your language young fellow, me lad. <br>
WIGGS: Here, what do you want in my kitchen? <br>
(Guess who, again.) <br>
DODO: We're looking for the next game. Perhaps you could help us. The
clue goes, Hunt the key to fit the door that leads out on the dancing
floor. Then escape the rhythmic beat, or you'll forever tap your feet. <br>
WIGGS: The only dancing floor what I know of is through there. <br>
DODO: Thank you. <br>
(She's pointing to an old oak door with a large lock and keyhole.) <br>
RUGG: All right, young fellow me lad, no loitering! Pick your feet up
then! Hup two three four, hup two three four. <br>
STEVEN: Why don't you go back in your box? <br>
RUGG: What's that? Why, you young whipper snapper, I'll er <br>
STEVEN: You'll what? <br>
RUGG: Well, I'll er, well you need a good hiding, me lad. <br>
STEVEN: And who's going to give it to me? <br>
WIGGS: And no fisticuffs in my nice clean kitchen, Sergeant, if you
please. <br>
RUGG: Oh ho, it's a good thing you spoke just then, Cook. No tellin'
what I mighten' a done to him if you hadn't stopped me. <br>
WIGGS: Oh, you're a terrible man when you're riled, Sergeant. <br>
RUGG: Well, army trainin', Cook. Six years with the Iron Duke. <br>
DODO: We've got to get in there. That's what the clue says. The Tardis
must be on the dance floor. <br>
STEVEN: How the Toymaker expects us to play his crazy games when he
locks all the doors, I don't know. <br>
RUGG: I'd like to have 'im in my mob. Just give me a month. I'll make a
man of him. <br>
STEVEN: What was that? <br>
RUGG: Er, well, er, not that he needs makin' a man of, but, er, sharpen
him up a bit like. <br>
STEVEN: Look, I warn you. <br>
DODO: Honestly, Steven. If they're not real, how can you lose your
temper with them? You can't have it both ways, you know. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, all right. I'll ignore them. They're just sent here to get
my goat. But where do we go from here? We're stuck. <br>
RUGG: Ha, ha, the Iron Duke wouldn't have been stuck over a little
thing like that. <br>
STEVEN: All right, I'm ignoring him. <br>
DODO: What would the Iron Duke have done? <br>
RUGG: Well, 'e'd have had another look at the riddle, I expect. <br>
DODO: The riddle? Then escape the rhythmic beat, or you'll forever tap
your feet. <br>
WIGGS: No, not that bit, duck. The first bit. <br>
DODO: Hunt the key to fit the door, that. Steven, that's it. <br>
STEVEN: Then the game is - <br>
RUGG: Hunt The Thimble! <br>
DODO: Only it's a key. And a rather large one at that. <br>
STEVEN: The only problem is, where do we start looking?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The trilogic tally reads 734.) <br>
TOYMAKER: You've stopped playing, Doctor. You know that isn't allowed.
Go from move 770! <br>
(Once again, the game rearranges itself.)<br>
TOYMAKER: Now play on. <br>
(The Doctor's body-less hand takes it's own turn.) <br>
TOYMAKER: You're still not playing fast enough. Go from move 813! Your
friends have reached their third game. Hunt the Key!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Cyril is asleep on a chair beside the range.) <br>
DODO: Steven, haven't we seen him before? <br>
STEVEN: I don't know. <br>
DODO: Wasn't he the Jack of Hearts? <br>
STEVEN: Possibly, but does it matter? I mean all the Toymaker's
creations look alike to me. We have to find the Tardis before the
Doctor reaches move 1,023, so we haven't got long to find that key.
It's hot! <br>
WIGGS: So what'd you expect? You come away from me pots and pans. <br>
DODO: Look, we've got to find the key to that door. <br>
WIGGS: Well, he won't find it there. <br>
DODO: How do you know? <br>
RUGG: Because Mrs. Wiggs always knows what's best, that's why. <br>
(Steven picks Cyril up off the chair - this is no mean feat - and
checks underneath him for the key. Dodo meanwhile sidles over to
Sergeant Rugg.) <br>
DODO: You'll help us find the key, won't you? <br>
RUGG: Er, ahem, well, er, I don' know, em <br>
DODO: You look so marvellous in that uniform. You must be very brave. <br>
RUGG: Well, er, I try to do my duty, girl. <br>
DODO: Then you'll help us, for my sake. <br>
RUGG: Well, er, alright, but for you, mind, not for him. <br>
DODO: Where do you suggest we start looking? <br>
RUGG: Ah, well, er, let's see now, er, what about this old dresser
here, hey? <br>
WIGGS: Here! You watch what you're doing with my dresser. <br>
(Whilst they rummage through drawers, Steven examines the cuckoo
clock.) <br>
WIGGS: What do you think this is? A bloomin' fair ground? Oh! Here, you
put them things back in the drawer. <br>
RUGG: It's all right, Mrs Wiggs. I'm just helping the young lady. Here,
er, what's your name, me girl? <br>
DODO: Dodo. <br>
RUGG: Dodo. Oh, what a lovely name, Dodo. Oh, I like that. <br>
WIGGS: Well, you go and like it somewhere else, and take your friend
with you. <br>
RUGG: Oh, come, Mrs Wiggs. The girl's been and gorn and lost her key. <br>
WIGGS: Well, she won't find it here. <br>
STEVEN: Take no notice of them, Dodo. They've been sent here by the
Toymaker to put us off. This time we're getting warm. <br>
(Mrs Wiggs returns to her pastry board unaware that Steven is searching
under the table.) <br>
WIGGS: Ahhh! That's me foot! You come out from under there! <br>
STEVEN: It isn't under the table. <br>
WIGGS: When you've quite finished. <br>
STEVEN: Dodo, take a look behind that thing. I'll take a look over
here. <br>
(Dodo climbs onto a chair in order to search behind the top of the
dresser.) <br>
RUGG: 'Ere, now, wait a minute, girl. You don't want to get up there.
You'll fall and break your leg. Eh, let me look for you. <br>
DODO: That's very kind of you. <br>
RUGG: Oh, not at all, ma'am. Happy to be of - oop - service. <br>
WIGGS: Sergeant Rugg! What do you think you're doing of up there? <br>
RUGG: Now don't you worry, Mrs Wiggs. I'll be all right. <br>
WIGGS: I'm not worried about. It's my best china! (smash) Oooh! Oh! Me
best plate! <br>
RUGG: A little accident, Mrs Wiggs. <br>
WIGGS: Accident? That was no accident! You dropped that plate
deliberate like! <br>
RUGG: I hope you're not calling me a liar, Mrs Wiggs - oop! <br>
WIGGS: Oh! Another accident, I suppose! <br>
DODO: Oh! Oh, perhaps you'd better come down, Sergeant. <br>
RUGG: Oh don't you worry, miss. It's perfectly all right. <br>
(More crashing sounds.) <br>
WIGGS: Oh! Sergeant Rugg! You come down here this instant! <br>
RUGG: Soldiers don't take orders from civilians, Cook. Now you just
pipe down! <br>
WIGGS: Pipe down? You great oaf. You couldn't fight a pussycat! <br>
RUGG: You didn't ought to have of said that, Cook. <br>
(More smashing sounds. The ensuing orgy of destruction wakes Cyril, who
takes refuge under the table.) <br>
WIGGS: Oh! Oh! Oh Sergeant Rugg! Just you wait till I make you sorry
for that. If you think I'm going to stand for you throwing my best
china about you're very much mistaken! Take that! <br>
DODO: Oh, please, please stop. This is all my fault. <br>
(The argument carries on in the background.) <br>
STEVEN: Dodo, ignore them! This is all being done to prevent us from
finding the key. They don't really exist, remember? It's not real. <br>
WIGGS: What did he say? <br>
DODO: Are you sure about that? <br>
STEVEN: Oh, come on. We've got to find that key. That is supposing
there is one. We've looked everywhere, haven't we? <br>
DODO: But I'm afraid it's all my fault/ <br>
STEVEN: Nonsense! This is another distraction laid on by the Toymaker
to stop us finding the key. <br>
DODO: Oh, where? You said it was just a distraction, and <br>
STEVEN: They seem to get rougher as they go along, but we've looked
everywhere. Do you suppose there really is a key? <br>
(At opposite ends of the kitchen table, the Sergeant and Mrs Wiggs are
using food as missiles.) <br>
WIGGS: Take that, and that, and that, and that, and that! <br>
DODO: Oh, look! You've thrown just about all the buns there are to
throw. Couldn't you both call a truce? <br>
WIGGS: A truce? After he broken me best china? <br>
DODO: Well, I'm sure he'll apologise. <br>
RUGG: Apologise? <br>
MRS. WIGGS: Oh! <br>
DODO: Oh, well, you did break her plates, you know. <br>
RUGG: Soldiers never apologise. It's a rule. <br>
DODO: But a gentleman would always apologise to a lady. <br>
WIGGS: Huh! Soldiers! A gentleman! <br>
DODO: Sergeant Rugg is, I'm sure of that. <br>
RUGG: I apologise. <br>
DODO: There. Now will you accept his apology? <br>
WIGGS: Oh, all right then. But he has to pay for my china! <br>
RUGG: Pay for the ch? Now then, you see why soldiers never apologise?
Give the old trout an inch.<br>
WIGGS: Old trout, is it??!! Just you wait for that, Sergeant Rugg! Old
trout! <br>
RUGG: Now then, careful with that broom, Mrs. Wiggs Careful. <br>
(As hostilities resume, Steven catches Cyril trying to sneak off.) <br>
CYRIL: Argh! Let me go. <br>
STEVEN: Where do you think you're going? <br>
CYRIL: N-n-n-n-n-n-nowhere! <br>
STEVEN: Come on, I think that you know where that key is, don't you?
Oh, so we're getting somewhere at last, are we? <br>
(Cyril locks himself inside the pantry.) <br>
STEVEN: Hey, you, come back here! <br>
DODO: I'm sure you'll hurt him with that broom! <br>
RUGG: Well, if she does, then this pie'll get hurt as well. <br>
WIGGS: What? Not that pie. Not that pie! Put it down! <br>
RUGG: Oh? Well then, you put that broom down, Missus. <br>
STEVEN: What's she so worried about this pie for? Look at the rest of
the mess. <br>
DODO: Steven, that's one place we haven't looked. <br>
STEVEN: Where? <br>
DODO: In the pie! <br>
STEVEN: I see what you mean. <br>
(In the excitement the pie is smashed at Dodo's feet.) <br>
DODO: Steven, the key! I've got it! <br>
STEVEN: Come on, Dodo, be quick! <br>
DODO: Goodbye! Sorry about your kitchen. <br>
(They disappear into the next room as the Toymaker appears beside his
quarrelling pawns.) <br>
TOYMAKER: Wretched pair! I give you a chance of life, and this is what
you do with it. Look at the kitchen! <br>
RUGG: My fault, sir, not her's. <br>
TOYMAKER: Such gallantry from a mere doll. Now listen to me, the pair
of you. Clean yourselves up, and get out onto that dance floor. At the
far end you will find a Tardis. Steven and Dodo must be prevented from
getting to it at all costs. Do you understand? If you fail me, I will
break you in pieces like this.<br>
(He smashes the last remaining plate.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ballroom]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The next room does indeed have a dancing floor, a
raised triangular dais on which three ballerina dolls are nearing the
end of their dance. The dance ends, the dolls take their bows then
relapse stiffly, mere mannequins once more. Beyond the dance floor the
familiar police box form is revealed.) <br>
STEVEN: The Tardis! <br>
(Steven is about to step onto the floor.) <br>
DODO: Steven, be careful. This could be as dangerous as those chairs. <br>
STEVEN: But there's no other way of getting to it. <br>
DODO: It can't be as simple as that, can it. There must be a catch
somewhere. Then escape the rhythmic beat, or you'll forever tap your
feet. What does it mean? <br>
(Steven holds out his hand cautiously over the dance floor and music is
heard. He pulls his hand back.) <br>
DODO: How strange. I can do it, too. <br>
STEVEN: Yes. The Doctor's game won't wait for us, though. We've got to
take the chance. <br>
(Rugg and Wiggs enter the room, all nice and clean again.) <br>
DODO: Hello. Ah, you made it up. <br>
RUGG: Well, Mrs. Wiggs' got much too warm an heart to keep a quarrel
going, miss. <br>
WIGGS: Oh, Sergeant's going to take me to the ball. <br>
DODO: The ball? <br>
RUGG: Yeah, right here, girl. No lack of partners, as you can see. Oh
they never get tired of dancing, them dolls. <br>
STEVEN: Well, it seems all right. I'm going to make a dash for it. <br>
(He steps on the rostrum and immediately the music begins.) <br>
DODO: Steven, this is no time for a dance. <br>
STEVEN: I can't help myself! <br>
(The dolls also begin to dance, advancing towards him in a line.) <br>
DODO: Steven, this is what the riddle meant!

TOYMAKER: You're doing very well, Doctor. Let's hope you haven't made a
mistake. Still, we'll find that out when you reach your 1,023 move.) <br>
(The Doctor's hand moves counter 2 onto counter 5 and then 1 onto 2.) <br>
TOYMAKER: I see that Steven has taken time off from the quest to go
dancing. Oh, keep on playing, Doctor. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven is dancing helplessly with one of the
dolls.) <br>
DODO: Get away from it. You must! The riddle warned us it would be
forever. <br>
STEVEN: I can't! It's holding me in a grip like steel! Get away from
the floor, Dodo. Go back! <br>
DODO: But then we can't reach the Tardis! <br>
STEVEN: I'll try to dance nearer to it! <br>
RUGG: Not a bad dancer for a civilian. <br>
WIGGS: Make a lovely partner for you, ducks. <br>
DODO: Can't you dance down to it, Steven? <br>
STEVEN: I can't lead! I'm just being carried round and round. <br>
DODO: Then I'm going to try and reach it. <br>
STEVEN: What are you doing? Go back. <br>
DODO: I can't! <br>
(Dodo is also caught up in the dance.) <br>
RUGG: Now that we're dancing, what was it the Toymaker wanted us to do?
<br>
WIGGS: Reach that big cupboard up there before them. <br>
RUGG: Ah, well, what about that doll there, then. <br>
WIGGS: Ah, that's the game, duck. You dance with her, while I run for
the cupboard up there. <br>
RUGG: Oh, beggin' your pardon, Mrs W, this is man's work. You dance,
and I'll run. Well, to be quite frank with you, Mrs W, soldiers don't
dance. Well, officers, perhaps. But sergeants, no. Here, why don't you
try the floor? <br>
(She does. The dolls change partners.) <br>
STEVEN: Dodo, keep close to me. <br>
DODO: Why? <br>
STEVEN: Don't ask questions. <br>
WIGGS: Oh, hurry up, Sergeant, I can't keep it up for long. <br>
RUGG: Just on my way, Mrs W. <br>
(But Rugg finds that his feet are not his own.) <br>
STEVEN: Dodo, come here. <br>
(Steven grabs Dodo and they dance together. <br>
WIGGS: I'm surprised at you, Sergeant Rugg. Put that hussy down and get
to the cupboard! <br>
RUGG: I can't! <br>
STEVEN: He's going, Dodo. We must get nearer the Tardis. <br>
DODO: He's bound to try and stop us somehow. <br>
STEVEN: Well, we'll be ready for them. We're almost there. Concentrate
now. Here we are! <br>
(Dancing in each other's arms, Steven and Dodo reach the police box
first. The door flies open and they dive inside, the door shutting
behind them. The Sergeant and Mrs Wiggs dance on.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STEVEN: Huh, it's another fake. I wonder how many
of these things he made? <br>
DODO: Far too many. I'm beginning to wonder if we'll ever see the real
one again. We might be shut in here forever.&nbsp;<br>
STEVEN: No, of course we'll find it. Come on, don't lose heart now.
We've been through too much. How on earth do we get out of this thing? <br>
DODO: I wonder if we'll ever see the sergeant and the cook again? They
were rather funny, you know. <br>
STEVEN: Look, you still believe in these creations of the Toymaker,
don't you? You can't see that they're just phantoms, things created in
his mind. <br>
DODO: If that's so, why do they lose to us? And always through doing
something silly and human? <br>
STEVEN: Oh, I don't know. Maybe they get out of his control. <br>
DODO: There, that's just what I meant. <br>
STEVEN: What are you talking about? <br>
DODO: Look, he can bring them to life, but they have wills and minds of
their own. I'll never be able to look at a doll or a playing card again
with an easy mind. They really do have a secret life of their own. <br>
STEVEN: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! We've got to get you out of here and quick! <br>
DODO: Why? What do you mean? <br>
STEVEN: This place is beginning to get you. <br>
DODO: Oh, rubbish! Just because you can't see it. <br>
STEVEN: We've got to find the next clue. Now there isn't even a
telephone here. It must be in here somewhere. <br>
DODO: Still, can't help wondering what happened to them. <br>

expressionless as the ballerinas around them.) </font></p>

TOYMAKER: You forget that I can see you, even if no one else can. But
you laugh too soon. The game is not yet over, either for you or for
your two clever friends. They still have a game or two to play yet. But
they must not win the next game. <br>
(The Toymaker throws his dolls into the chest, one by one.) <br>
TOYMAKER: Clowns! Nursery characters! Playing cards! I was foolish to
trust you to play my games for me. You're all too human, too kind. I
must find a more deadly character. <br>
(He takes out the Cyril doll.) <br>
TOYMAKER: Ah! The most deadly character of them all because he looks so
innocent. A fat, jolly school boy. I wonder what your friends will make
of him, Doctor? And I see you only have 123 moves to go.

CYRIL: Well, here we are. Here's the next game. Tardis Hopscotch. <br>
STEVEN: What are we supposed to do with it? <br>
CYRIL: Well, it's very simple, really. You see, each player takes one
of these dice, and throws them onto the triangles, and the number that
you've thrown will appear up at the end there, on the dice indicator.
(a rotating barber's pole) That's to make absolutely certain that no
one can cheat. And you move forward the number that you've thrown. The
first one to reach triangle fourteen's the winner. Easy, isn't it? <br>
STEVEN: It's too easy. What's the catch? <br>
CYRIL: No catch. First one home's the winner. <br>
STEVEN: That gives us a two to one chance over you. <br>
CYRIL: Why, so it does. Well, there you are. You just jump from
triangle to triangle and the first one home wins. <br>
STEVEN: Why do we have to jump? <br>
CYRIL: Well, you can walk if you like, but I shouldn't if I were you. <br>
STEVEN: Why not? <br>
CYRIL: Well, you see, all the area between the triangles is electric,
and you'll be killed.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOYMAKER: I don't think your friends will do so
well now, Doctor. Cyril hates to lose, so he makes sure that he never
does. Oh, don't stop playing, Doctor. You're so near the end. Soon
you'll discover whether or not you've got the sequence right. <br>
(The Doctor moves counter 1 onto 2, 3 onto 4, and 5 onto 8.) <br>
TOYMAKER: I think you need help. Go from move 930. <br>
(The pieces move again. On A are counters 6 and 1, on B are 7 and 2, on
C are counters 10, 9, 8, 5, 4 and 3. Now the Doctor takes his next
turn. 1 onto 2 again and 3 onto 6.) <br>
TOYMAKER: At this rate, you'll finish your game long before Steven and
Dodo find the Tardis. It will be fun having you here. and your friends
will make charming dolls. It may interest you to know that their chairs
are ready and waiting for them in the doll's house.

BOTH: Yes.<br>
CYRIL: Ladies first, if you don't mind. <br>
(Dodo climbs onto platform one and throws her die. ) <br>
DODO: Three. <br>
STEVEN: Careful, Dodo. <br>
DODO: One, two, three. <br>
CYRIL: You next. <br>
STEVEN: You're just too good to be true, aren't you. Four. One, two,
three, four.<br>
(A buzzer sounds.)&nbsp;<br>
STEVEN: It says go on to number seven. Do I? <br>
CYRIL: Yes, go on.<br>
STEVEN: One, two. <br>
CYRIL: Oh, by the way, I should have told you. If you land on a
triangle that's already occupied, the first player has to go back to
the starting post. <br>
STEVEN: Now I see why you let us go first. All right, go on, don't keep
us in suspense. <br>
CYRIL: It's all part of the game, old chap. Two. One, two. <br>
(So, we have Cyril on 3, Dodo on 4 and Steven on 7.) <br>
DODO: Now it's my turn. I think I'm going to enjoy this game. Three.
Oh, I'm sorry, Steven. Do I have to send you back to the start? <br>
STEVEN: Look, surely we can't send each other back. We're supposed to
be playing together. <br>
CYRIL: If you don't abide by the rules, you can't possibly win the
game. <br>
DODO: He's right, Steven. We must play fair. After all, we are two to
one. <br>
STEVEN: All right. <br>
(With Dodo now occupying number 7, Steven reluctantly returns to the
start.) <br>
STEVEN: Watch him. <br>
(When Steven gets to number 1, the buzzer sounds and it's miss a turn.)
<br>
STEVEN: What's that mean? <br>
CYRIL: He's pretending he doesn't understand the rules. Wizard sense of
humour. You go back a turn. My turn now, I think. Ah! A three. One,
two, three. I'm still right behind you.

to have the game well in hand. Your friends are tiring, Doctor. I don't
think they're going to get your Tardis back. <br>
(The Doctor makes two more moves.)<br>
TOYMAKER: As you are certainly going to lose, I feel I should be kinder
to you. You're no longer under the ban of silence. There! I have given
you back your voice. Now you're sulking. Or have you forgotten how to
speak? <br>
DOCTOR: Throughout this game you have spent a great deal of trouble in
trying to break my concentration. And it's very unlikely that you will
succeed now.

STEVEN: Look, I've told you before about these idiotic jokes. She
nearly fell off. <br>
CYRIL: It's all part of the game, old chap. Now you can go back to the
start for cheating. <br>
DODO: That's not fair, is it? <br>
CYRIL: Certainly! He moved out of his triangle and it wasn't his turn.
And I've landed on your triangle, so you can both go back to the start.
<br>
STEVEN: I've had enough of this. He makes up the rules as he goes
along. Come on, Dodo. I'm going to the finish line. I want to see if
that's the real Tardis or not. <br>
(An image of the Toymaker appears in front of him.) <br>
TOYMAKER: Don't you like my little game? <br>
STEVEN: No, I don't. <br>
TOYMAKER: What a pity to give up now, having overcome so many
obstacles. <br>
DODO: We're not giving up. <br>
TOYMAKER: Are you sure? <br>
STEVEN: I just want to get to the end of this. <br>
(He tries to leap to the next triangle, but encounters an invisible
wall.) <br>
STEVEN: It's no good. It's some sort of invisible barrier. <br>
TOYMAKER: Precisely. A barrier that yields only to those who play the
game according to the rules. So perhaps you'll go back to the platform
where you started? <br>
(The Toymaker image disappears.) <br>
STEVEN: Come on, Dodo. <br>
CYRIL: (targeting Steven with his catapult) Yah! One up to me. My turn
now, I think. Oh! A two. One, two. <br>
STEVEN: I'm going to see if there's any invisible barrier around his
backside. <br>
DODO: Better not. Who's turn is it? <br>
STEVEN: Mine. Ah, that's better. Six. One, two (and wobbles on landing)
three, four, five, six. Do I get a second turn for a six? <br>
CYRIL: Eh? Certainly not. <br>

TOYMAKER: I think they'll abide by the rules now, Doctor. Don't you
agree? There's no point in giving you back your power of speech if
you're going to just sit there silent and solemn. <br>
DOCTOR: You seem to say quite enough for both of us. In any case, I'm
busy. <br>
TOYMAKER: Your friends are not doing very well. <br>
DOCTOR: I think your friend Cyril won't do so well when Steven catches
up with him. <br>
TOYMAKER: Poor Steven. Little does he know. You're playing too slowly,
Doctor. Go from move one thousand. (Pyramid on C is almost complete.
Counter 4 is on A and counter 5 is on B) <br>
TOYMAKER: Only twenty three moves to go. And look, your friend Steven
has had to miss a turn.

CYRIL: You can't possibly win now. Why don't you both give up? <br>
STEVEN: It's up to you now, Dodo. Come on, give it a good shake. <br>
DODO: Six! <br>
(Cyril puts a slippery powder around the edge of his number 11.) <br>
DODO: One. <br>
STEVEN: Careful.<br>
DODO: Two, three, four, five, six. (She's on 10) Now I only need four
to get home. <br>
CYRIL: And I only needed three and it's my turn now. Too bad, isn't it.
Oh, two. One, two. <br>
(The indicator buzzes.) <br>
DODO: Steven, look. He has to go back to nine! <br>
STEVEN: Come on. Look who's trying to cheat now. <br>
CYRIL: Give a chap a chance to do up his shoelace, will you? One, two,
three, four. <br>
STEVEN: That's better. Now come on, Dodo, you must throw a four. <br>
(Cyril wails.) <br>
DODO: Steven, do you think he's really hurt? <br>
STEVEN: It's another trick. Roll the dice. <br>
DODO: Look, he's bleeding. He's hurt his foot. We can't just leave him.
<br>
STEVEN: Play! <br>
DODO: No! I'm going to help him. <br>
STEVEN: Dodo! <br>
DODO: Oh, look! You'd better take your sock off. Hey, That's red ink! <br>
CYRIL: Of course it is. You're so easy to fool, you are. Now you can go
back to the start for getting out of your triangle, and miss a turn.
That means it's my turn now! <br>
DODO: Well, of all the spiteful things! <br>
CYRIL: Teach you to think you can beat me at a game! A five! Hooray,
I've won! Yaroo! Hoorah for me! <br>
(In his eagerness, he goes too fast and slips on the powder he put on
number 11. He falls off the triangle into the death trap, vanishing in
a flash. When the smoke clears, his charred doll-like remains can be
seen on the electrified floor.)<br>
DODO: What happened? <br>
STEVEN: I don't know. Poor old Cyril. Hey, this triangle's covered in
slippery powder. He must have put this here himself and forgotten all
about it. He was caught in his own trap. It serves him right. Come on,
Dodo. The game's over. <br>
DODO: No, we've got to play the game to the end. You heard what the
Toymaker said. I'm sure I can throw that four. <br>
STEVEN: All right, well, hurry. Look at that tally. (1,014) The
Doctor's almost finished his game. <br>
DODO: Four! We've won, Steven! (and nearly falls off number 11
herself.) <br>
STEVEN: Dodo, I told you about the powder. Now, take it easy. We
mustn't lose now. Now, go on. I'll follow you over. <br>
(They both arrive at number 14, the Tardis.) <br>
DODO: Perhaps it's just another fake.

formalities. You have been defeated, so now leave us alone. <br>

DOCTOR: Now don't start red herrings, you charlatan. <br>
TOYMAKER [on monitor]: Go on, young people, go on. Ask your elderly

DOCTOR: No, my dear boy. He's just tricking us into despair. Take no
notice of him. <br>
TOYMAKER [on monitor]: Tell them the truth, Doctor. Hide nothing. <br>
DODO: You must tell us. We ought to know. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I am compelled to tell the truth. It is possible that the
Toymaker can drag us down in defeat with him, unless <br>
STEVEN: Unless what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's all very simple. It's a matter of the battle of our
brains. <br>
DODO: Well, do we have a chance to escape? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we still have a chance, but we must proceed with cunning. <br>
TOYMAKER [on monitor]: An impossible task. <br>

now. <br>
TOYMAKER [on monitor]: We shall see. <br>
DOCTOR: Well said, my boy, well said. <br>
TOYMAKER [on monitor]: Well said? He doesn't even know what he is
saying. These adolescent expressions of loyalty. Before you make
puerile promises, remember the past, your little adventures. Remember
my power. <br>
STEVEN: Your power? We won through, didn't we? <br>
(The Toymaker is there in person.) <br>
TOYMAKER: Perhaps, but would you dare to play those little games again?
<br>
STEVEN: Not until I've laid hands on you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's no use, Steven. Leave him. <br>
DODO: Are you all right? <br>
STEVEN: I couldn't touch him. <br>
DOCTOR: He's using his mind to turn your strength against yourself.
Now, go back into the Tardis. I will deal with him. <br>
(Dodo and Steven leave.) <br>
TOYMAKER: Doctor, I offer you power. Power to corrupt, to destroy.
Think of the exhilaration of that power. Serve me and live. <br>
DOCTOR: Never! Never, my friend. You have been defeated. <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis.) <br>
TOYMAKER: We will see, old man. The game is not yet over. We shall see.
<br>
(The Toymaker sits down next to the trilogic board, and the Doctor
comes out of the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: What have you done? Stop meddling with my ship!&nbsp;<br>
TOYMAKER: It isn't what I have done, but what you have not done. You
must finish the game. You cannot leave here until you have. <br>
DOCTOR: Your infantile behaviour is beyond a joke. No. Of course, I
mustn't. You very nearly caught me then. <br>
TOYMAKER: Make your last move, Doctor. Make your move. <br>
DOCTOR: But if I do, this place vanishes. <br>
TOYMAKER: And then you have won completely. <br>
DOCTOR: And if this place vanishes, then the Tardis and the rest of us,
will vanish also. <br>
TOYMAKER: Correct. That is the price of success. Make your last move,
Doctor. Make your last move.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STEVEN: What can be keeping him? <br>
DODO: Something the Toymaker has done to the Tardis. The Doctor has to
persuade the Toymaker to let us go. <br>
STEVEN: We won his games, we have the right to go. The Toymaker said
that. <br>
DODO: Now I'm here, I don't mind. I know I'm safe. <br>
STEVEN: I think I'm going to take. Oh, here he is. <br>
(The Doctor enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Close the doors, my boy. <br>
STEVEN: So what's happened? <br>
DOCTOR: It's no use. <br>
STEVEN: What's he done? <br>
DOCTOR: If we destroy the Toymaker, we destroy this world. <br>
STEVEN: Well, is that bad? <br>
DODO: Surely, that's a good thing. This is really a very sad place. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think neither of you understand. As the games are over,
and won by us, everything outside the Tardis disappears. And if we are
there, we disappear also. <br>
DODO: But we have won and it hasn't happened yet. <br>
DOCTOR: But it will, my dear, the moment I go out there and make the
final move of the trilogic game. <br>
STEVEN: Why doesn't he just let us go? He can't want to be destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, he won't be. <br>
DODO: But if everything disappears, why not him? <br>
DOCTOR: If the Toymaker loses the game, his world will vanish, but he
has the power to build a new one. <br>
DODO: How? <br>
DOCTOR: The Toymaker is immortal. He's lasted for thousands of years.
Very occasionally, of course, he loses a game, and then he has to pay
the price. <br>
STEVEN: And that price is the loss of his world? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but he himself is not destroyed. He goes on forever. <br>
STEVEN: So we can't leave. <br>

DOCTOR [OC]: Let me have the trilogic game in here. <br>
TOYMAKER: Of course not. Be reasonable, Doctor. If I allow you to make
the last move in there, then you can preset your controls and
dematerialise at the same moment that my world vanishes. Then you will
escape. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: It will make no difference to you. You can build a new

DODO: You did it! You did it! We won! <br>
STEVEN: Doctor, but how was it done? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, it was your very idea. Your very idea. Don't you
see? When the Toymaker wanted to move the pieces, he had to command
them in a certain tone of voice to make them move at all. <br>
DODO: But you had to do it twice. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but in the first place, you see, I couldn't, because I
used my own voice. <br>
DODO: I don't see. <br>
STEVEN: I do. The Toymaker wasn't playing. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly, dear boy, exactly. Therefore, I had to imitate the
Toymaker's voice to make them obey me, and they did. <br>
DODO: We'll never see him again, will we, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear, don't talk too soon. The mind is indestructible.
So is the Toymaker. <br>
STEVEN: What, you mean he can never be destroyed? <br>
DODO: But you defeated him. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, just at this moment, but there will be other meetings in

DODO: Then your battle with him will never end. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, my dear, but anyway, let us cheer up.
After all we did win the games. <br>
DODO: Hey, let's celebrate with these. <br>
DOCTOR: With what? <br>
DODO: Here, these. <br>
DOCTOR: What are those? <br>
DODO: They're Cyril's sweets. He gave them to me just before the race
game. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, throw them away, Dodo. I only told you to take them so that
we wouldn't waste anymore time. <br>
DODO: Oh, all right. <br>

I wonder. <br>
