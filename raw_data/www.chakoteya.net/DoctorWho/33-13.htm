like the moon's surface, complete with US flag out straight as if there
was no air or gravity, and half an Earth in the dark sky. The Doctor,
Clara, then Angie and Artie Maitland put their heads out of the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, here we are. Hedgewick's World. The biggest and best
amusement park there will ever be, and we've got a golden ticket. Eh?
Eh? Fun. <br>
CLARA: Fun? <br>
ANGIE: Your stupid box can't even get us to the right place. This is
like a moon base or something. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not the moon. <br>
ARTIE: Actually, I think it does look like the moon, only dirtier. <br>
DOCTOR: Hey. Guys. It's not the moon, okay? It's a Spacey Zoomer ride,
or it was. <br>
(A door opens in one of the large rocks, and a man wearing a tall hat
looks out.) <br>
WEBLEY: Psst. Excuse I. I don't suppose you happen to be my lift off
planet? Dave's Discount Interstellar Removals? <br>
CLARA: Afraid not. <br>
WEBLEY: They were meant to be here six months ago. Well, that's Dave
for you, see? Unreliable. <br>
(A woman's voice cuts through the air.) <br>
CAPTAIN [OC]: Stay where you are! <br>
WEBLEY: Oops. <br>
(Webley ducks back inside as the military run in.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Throw down your weapons and identify yourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No weapons. Golden ticket. Spacey Zoomer. Free ice cream? <br>
CAPTAIN: Who are you? This planet is closed, by Imperial order. <br>
DOCTOR: How's this? <br>
(He holds up his psychic paper.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Oh. Welcome, Proconsul. I wish they'd told us you were coming.
Any news of the Emperor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the Emperor. No, no. None that you'd er <br>
CAPTAIN: We pray for his return. If there is anything you need, my
platoon is at your service. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Righty-o. Well, carry on, Captain. <br>
CAPTAIN: Platoon, let's move out! On the double. Two, three, four. Two,
three, four. Two, three, four. <br>
(The military run off, and Webley pokes his head out again.) <br>
WEBLEY: Have they gone? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
WEBLEY: Uniforms give me the heebie-jeebies. Come on. They can't stop
me being here, but they don't like it. <br>
(He leads them away from the Zoomer for a view of the whole amusement
park.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ha, ha! You see? I told you it was amazing. Well, it used to
be. <br>
(Wrecked mega-scenic rollercoaster and other rides. Grass is growing in
the cracks in the concrete.) <br>
WEBLEY: It closed down. Wish I'd known that before I landed here. But
let me show you my collection. Come along. Follow me. This way. This
way in, come on. </font></p>

with lots of waxworks on display, all lit by chandeliers hanging from
the ceiling.) <br>
WEBLEY: Welcome to my show. Webley's World of Wonders. Miracles,
marvels and more await you. I am Impresario Webley. You see before you
waxwork representations of the famous and the infamous. Anybody here
play chess? <br>
(The Doctor puts his hand up.) <br>
WEBLEY: Perhaps you, young man? <br>
ARTIE: Actually, I'm in my school chess club. <br>
WEBLEY: Ah. Follow me. </font></p>

of the age, the miracle of modernity. <br>
(Sitting by the chess board is something covered in a satin cloth.) <br>
WEBLEY: We defeated them all a thousand years ago, but now he's back,
to destroy you. Behold, the enemy! <br>
(Webley whips the cloth off a slightly tarnished silver coloured robot,
which raises its head.) <br>
DOCTOR: Cyberman! Get down! <br>
WEBLEY: No need to panic, my young friends. We all know there are no
more living Cybermen. What you are seeing is a miracle. The six hundred
and ninety ninth wonder of the universe, as displayed before the
Imperial court, and only here to destroy you at chess. <br>
(The Doctor is scanning and investigating.) <br>
WEBLEY: Careful now. An empty shell, and yet it moves. How? <br>
ANGIE: Magic. <br>
WEBLEY: That might well be, young lady, but a single penny wins you
five Imperial shillings <br>
(Two tiny slim metallic bugs with a flashing blue eye are watching from
a waxwork Blowfish head. Something is using them to watch the scene.) <br>
WEBLEY: If you can beat this empty shell at chess. <br>
ARTIE: I haven't got a penny, but I've got a sandwich. <br>
WEBLEY: All right, take a seat. It is free of all devices, and yet it
has never been beaten. Would you like to make the first move, young
man? <br>
(Artie moves his King's Bishop's pawn one space. The Cyberman counters
by moving its King's pawn two spaces.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, Artie. No, don't do that, it <br>
(Artie advances his King's Knight's pawn two spaces. Up comes the Black
Queen to end the game.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's a fool's mate. <br>
WEBLEY: If you can tell me how it works, I'll give you a silver penny. <br>
ANGIE: I think you do it with mirrors? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Mirrors. Clever girl. Well, let's see, hey? Low tech. It's
a puppet. Monofilament strings, which means the brains are in <br>
(The Doctor opens a door in the Cyberman's chair to reveal a little man
with a control box.) <br>
PORRIDGE: Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
PORRIDGE: I'm the brains. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
PORRIDGE: Give us a hand. <br>
(The Doctor helps Porridge out of the small space.) <br>
PORRIDGE: They call me Porridge. Oh, it's good to be out of that box. <br>
WEBLEY: For you, Miss, an Imperial penny. <br>
(Which Webley apparently produces from Angie's ear. The Doctor notices
a small swarm of tiny metal bugs slithering across the floor.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WEBLEY: I have not one but three Cybermen in my
collection. <br>
(The exhibit is labelled The Great Enemy. The Doctor checks that they
are inert. Angie looks at another waxwork, a tall man with a familiar
face.) <br>
ANGIE: Is that the King? <br>
PORRIDGE: Emperor. Ludens Nimrod Kendrick, etc, etc, the forty first.
Defender of Humanity, Imperator of known space. <br>
CLARA: He looks a bit full of himself. <br>
PORRIDGE: Don't say things like that about the Imperial family. You can
end up on the run for the rest of your life. <br>
ARTIE: They don't sound very nice. <br>
PORRIDGE: Go on. If the kids want to ride the Spacey Zoomer, then I can
operate the gravity console. <br>
(Angie compares the image on the coin to the waxwork.) <br>
ARTIE: Angie! </font></p>

microgravity. Clara takes photographs with her phone.) <br>
ARTIE: Wow! <br>
CLARA: Smile! Say, Spacey Zoomer. <br>
ARTIE: Look at us, Doctor. We're flying! <br>
DOCTOR: Having a good time? <br>
(Porridge turns off the anti-gravity.) <br>
ARTIE: I think that was the most fun I've had in my whole life. <br>
ANGIE: It was (pause) okay. <br>
ARTIE: Clara, I think outer space is actually very interesting. <br>
CLARA: Right. Wonderful day out, Doctor, but time to get the kids home.
<br>
(The Doctor is scanning with the sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Er, no. Not actually ready to leave. <br>
CLARA: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Reasons. <br>
CLARA: What reasons? <br>
DOCTOR: Insects. Funny insects. I should a them to my funny insect
collection. <br>
CLARA: You collect funny insects? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm starting to, right now. </font></p>

sleep.) <br>
ANGIE: How long do we have to stay here? <br>
DOCTOR: Not long. Have a nap. I'll wake you when we're ready to leave. <br>
PORRIDGE: Comfy? <br>
CLARA: Sleep well. <br>
PORRIDGE: Good night. <br>
(The Doctor turns the lights out as he leaves. Clara and Porridge
follow.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't wander off. Now, I'm not just saying don't wander off, I
mean it. Otherwise you'll wander off and the next thing you know,
somebody's going to have to start rescuing somebody. <br>
ANGIE: From what? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Nobody needs rescuing from anything. Don't wander off.
Sweet dreams. </font></p>

enjoys the sandwich he won from Artie.) <br>
WEBLEY: Total takings for the day, one sandwich. Better than no
sandwich, of course. Not as good as two sandwiches, or even a chicken. <br>
(The Cyberman grabs his arms.) <br>
WEBLEY: That's a bit odd. That's not funny. Give me my hands back. <br>
(Lots of the micro-Cybermats rush out of the Cyberman's eye sockets and
across to Webley.) <br>
CYBERMAN: Upgrade in progress. <br>

ANGIE: I hate the future. It's stupid. There's not even phone service.
I'm out of here. <br>
ARTIE: The Doctor said not to wander off. <br>
ANGIE: He said that, and then he wandered off. <br>
(The mini-Cybermats find Angie's discarded mobile phone and swarm all
over it.) <br>
ARTIE: I don't think Clara would like that. <br>
ANGIE: She's not our mum. <br>
ARTIE: Don't leave me here. <br>
(The monitor display says Disassembly required, then Upgrade will
commence.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Clara and Porridge walk together.) <br>
CLARA: Was this really the biggest amusement park in the universe? <br>
PORRIDGE: Yeah. Hedgewick bought the planet cheap. It'd been trashed in
the Cyberwars. <br>
CLARA: Who were we fighting? <br>
PORRIDGE: Cybermen. Technologically upgraded warriors. We couldn't win.
Sometimes we fought to a draw, but then they'd upgrade themselves, fix
their weaknesses and destroy us. It's hard to fight an enemy that uses
your armies as spare parts. <br>
CLARA: You beat them, though. Beat them or you wouldn't be here. How? <br>
PORRIDGE: Look up there. That corner of sky? What do you see? <br>
CLARA: Nothing. It's just black. No stars, no nothing. <br>
PORRIDGE: It use to be the Tiberion Spiral Galaxy. A million star
systems, a hundred million worlds, a billion trillion people. It's not
there any more. No more Tiberion Galaxy. No more Cybermen. It was
effective. <br>
CLARA: It's horrible. <br>
PORRIDGE: Yeah. I feel like a monster sometimes. <br>
CLARA: Why? <br>
PORRIDGE: Because instead of mourning a billion trillion dead people, I
just feel sorry for the poor blighter who had to press the button and
blow it all up. <br>
DOCTOR: Clara, did you tell Angie she could go to the barracks? <br>
CLARA: You know I didn't. She hasn't. <br>
DOCTOR: She's just gone in there. <br>
CLARA: Come on. </font></p>

CAPTAIN: It can't be broken. It's a solid state subether ansible class
communicator. Just run the diagnostics. <br>
BEAUTY: There's nothing left to diagnose. It's not broken, it's empty.
All the components have gone. <br>
CAPTAIN: Well, you must have replacement parts. <br>
BEAUTY: Not enough to build a new one. <br>
BRAINS: Captain, the weather controller is malfunctioning again.
There's storms, heat waves, snow. <br>
ANGIE: Hello, I'm bored. <br>
CAPTAIN: Where's your big sister? <br>
ANGIE: Clara? She's not my sister. She's stupid. She's talking to
Porridge. <br>

at him.) <br>
ARTIE: I'm not scared, if you're wondering. I just think I ought to
turn the lights back on. <br>
(Artie makes his nervous way to the light switch and turns it on. Then
a Cyberman grabs him from behind.) </font></p>

ANGIE: Well, you must have seen him. <br>
CLARA: Angie! Angie! <br>
(Clara and the Doctor enter.) <br>
ANGIE: She always has to turn up and spoil everything. I wasn't doing
anything. Why can't you just leave me alone? <br>
(A big crash, and enter a Cyberman.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Cyberman! <br>
CLARA: Angie! <br>
CAPTAIN: Attack formation. <br>
(The Cyberman moves faster than a blur while the platoon try to sort
themselves out. A fat man - Ha-Ha -&nbsp; runs forward whilst
another man with a pony-tail grabs a chair. The fat man gets swatted
aside.) <br>
CAPTAIN: No! Attack formation, quickly. <br>
(They start shooting at the Cyberman.) <br>
CYBERMAN: Upgrade in progress. <br>
CLARA: Angie! <br>
(The Cyberman moves through the group as if they are standing still and
puts Angie over his shoulder, carrying her off.) <br>
CLARA: Angie! <br>
DOCTOR: Clara. Clara! <br>
(He drags Clara back.) <br>
CAPTAIN: That was a Cyberman. But they're extinct. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me. I will get her back. Captain, a word please. Now,
correct me if I'm wrong, but I take it your platoon doesn't do much
fighting. <br>
CAPTAIN: What do you expect? <br>
CLARA: What? <br>
CAPTAIN: We're a punishment platoon. It's why they sent us out here, so
we can't get into trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, right, well, okay. As Imperial Consul, I'm putting Clara
in charge. <br>
(The Doctor pins the Captain's insignia on Clara's jacket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Clara, stay alive until I get back, and don't let anyone blow
up this planet. <br>
CLARA: Is that something they're likely to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Get to somewhere defensible. <br>
CLARA: Where are you going? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm getting Angie, finding Artie and looking for funny insects.
Stay alive. And you lot, no blowing up this planet! <br>

the Cyberiad, the Cyberplanners built a Valkyrie, to save critically
damaged units and bring them here, and one by one, repair them. <br>
DOCTOR: The people who vanished from the amusement park, they were
spare parts for repairs. <br>
WEBLEY: We've upgraded ourselves. The next model will be undefeatable. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing's undefeatable. <br>
WEBLEY: We needed children to build a new Cyberplanner. A child's
brain, with its infinite potential, is perfect for our needs. But we no
longer need the children. The Cybermites have been scanning your brain,
Doctor. It's quite remarkable. <br>
DOCTOR: Also completely useless to you. Cybermen use human parts. I'm
not human. You can't convert non-humans. <br>
WEBLEY: Well, that was true a long time ago. But we've upgraded
ourselves. Current Cyberunits use almost any living components. <br>
(Webley throws some Cybermites onto the Doctor. They get inside and he
screams. The Doctor acquires some silver components on left side of his
face. He is now a split personality. Cyberplanner Doctor will be
designated C-Doctor. Resistance is futile.) <br>

CAPTAIN: Cybermen have been extinct for a thousand years. Even one
Anti-Cyber gun is a miracle. These things are hand-pulsers. Touch the
back of a Cyberman's head, the electomagnetic pulse deactivates it. <br>
CLARA: What's this for? Just a mad guess here, it blows up the planet? <br>
CAPTAIN: Implodes it. There's also a trigger unit. <br>
CLARA: I'll have that, then. Is there any other way to activate the

is there no record of you anywhere in the databanks of the Cyberiad?
Oh, you're good. Oh, you've been eliminating yourself from history. You

PORRIDGE: Like you said, the communicators are out. The only way you
can report this now is to activate the bomb. <br>
CAPTAIN: Yes. <br>
PORRIDGE: And I forbid you to do that. <br>
CLARA: I don't get it. Why would you blow up a whole planet and
everybody on it just to get rid of one Cyberman? <br>
PORRIDGE: We tried other ways, but they only work sometimes, so now we
take drastic action. And it works. <br>
CAPTAIN: If you find a Cyberman and you can't destroy it immediately,
you implode the planet. I was sent here because I didn't follow orders.
I can make up for that. <br>
CLARA: Put it down. I forbid you. <br>
PORRIDGE: Yeah. What she said. <br>

on. So, good news, I've kidnapped the Cyberplanner and right now I'm

break his promises to get out of my head and then kill us all anyway. <br>
