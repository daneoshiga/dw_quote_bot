<br>
DOCTOR: Go to your room. <br>
(The patients in the ward and the child in the house stand still.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go to your room. I mean it. I'm very, very angry with you. I am
very, very cross. Go to your room! <br>
(The child and the patients hang their heads in shame and shuffle away.
The child leaves the Lloyd's house and the patients get back into bed.)
<br>
DOCTOR: I'm really glad that worked. Those would have been terrible
last words.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: Why are they all wearing gas masks? <br>
JACK: They're not. Those masks are flesh and bone. <br>
DOCTOR: How was your con supposed to work? <br>
JACK: Simple enough, really. Find some harmless piece of space junk,
let the nearest Time Agent track it back to Earth, convince him it's
valuable, name a price. When he's put fifty percent up front, oops! A
German bomb falls on it, destroys it forever. He never gets to see what
he's paid for, never knows he's been had. I buy him a drink with his
own money, and we discuss dumb luck. The perfect self-cleaning con. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Perfect. <br>
JACK: The London Blitz is great for self-cleaners. Pompeii's nice if
you want to make a vacation of it though, but you've got to set your
alarm for volcano day. Getting a hint of disapproval. <br>
DOCTOR: Take a look around the room. This is what your harmless piece
of space-junk did. <br>
JACK: It was a burnt-out medical transporter. It was empty. <br>
DOCTOR: Rose. <br>
ROSE: Are we getting out of here? <br>
DOCTOR: We're going upstairs. <br>
JACK: I even programmed the flight computer so it wouldn't land on
anything living. I harmed no-one. I don't know what's happening here,
but believe me, I had nothing to do with it. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll tell you what's happening. You forgot to set your alarm
clock. It's volcano day. <br>
(A siren sounds.) <br>
ROSE: What's that? <br>
JACK: The all clear. <br>
DOCTOR: I wish. </font></p>

ROSE: Doctor? <br>
(They run past the staircase. The Doctor is the next flight
up.)&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Have you got a blaster? <br>
JACK: Sure! <br>
(They run up to join him outside a secure metal door.) <br>
DOCTOR: The night your space-junk landed, someone was hurt. This was
where they were taken. <br>
ROSE: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Let's find out. Get it open. <br>
ROSE: What's wrong with your sonic screwdriver? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. <br>
(Jack's blaster disintegrates the lock.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sonic blaster, fifty first century. Weapon Factories of
Villengard? <br>
JACK: You've been to the factories? <br>
DOCTOR: Once. <br>
JACK: Well, they gone now, destroyed. The main reactor went critical.
Vaporized the lot. <br>
DOCTOR: Like I said. Once. There's a banana grove there, now. I like
bananas. Bananas are good. <br>
ROSE: Nice blast pattern. <br>
JACK: Digital. <br>
ROSE: Squareness gun. <br>
JACK: Yeah. <br>
ROSE: I like it. </font></p>

DOCTOR: What do you think? <br>
JACK: Something got out of here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. And? <br>
JACK: Something powerful. Angry. <br>
DOCTOR: Powerful and angry. <br>
(There are child's crayon drawings scattered on the floor and a Steiff
teddy bear.) <br>
JACK: A child? I suppose this explains Mummy. <br>
ROSE: How could a child do this? <br>
(The Doctor turns on a tape machine.) <br>
CONSTANTINE [OC]: Do you know where you are? <br>
CHILD [OC]: Are you my mummy? <br>
CONSTANTINE [OC]: Are you aware of what's around you? Can you see? <br>
CHILD [OC]: Are you my mummy? <br>
CONSTANTINE [OC]: What do you want? Do you know <br>
CHILD [OC]: I want my mummy. Are you my mummy? I want my mummy! Are you
my mummy? Are you my mummy? Mummy? Mummy? <br>
ROSE: Doctor, I've heard this voice before. <br>
DOCTOR: Me too. <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? <br>
ROSE: Always are you my mummy?. Like he doesn't know. <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? <br>
ROSE: Why doesn't he know? <br>
CHILD: Are you there, mummy? Mummy?

food on this table. The sweat on my brow, that food is. The sweat on my
brow. Anything else you'd like? I've got a whole house here. Anything
else you'd like to help yourself to? <br>
NANCY: Yeah. I'd like some wire cutters, please. Something that can cut
through barbed wire. Oh, and a torch. Don't look like that, Mister
Lloyd. I know you've got plenty of tools in here. I've been watching
this house for ages. And I'd like another look round your kitchen
cupboards. I was in a hurry the first time. I want to see if there's
anything I missed. <br>
LLOYD: The food on this table <br>
NANCY: It's an awful lot of food, isn't it, Mister Lloyd? A lot more
than on anyone else's table. Half this street thinks your missus must
be messing about with Mister Haverstock, the butcher. But she's not, is
she? You are. Wire cutters. Torch. Food. And I'd like to use your
bathroom before I leave, please. Oh, look. There's the sweat on your
brow.

ROSE: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Can you sense it? <br>
JACK: Sense what? <br>
DOCTOR: Coming out of the walls. Can you feel it? <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? <br>
DOCTOR: Funny little human brains. How do you get around in those
things? <br>
ROSE: When he's stressed, he likes to insult species. <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, I'm thinking. <br>
ROSE: He cuts himself shaving, he does half an hour on life forms he's
cleverer than. <br>
DOCTOR: There are these children living rough round the bomb sites.
They come out during air-raids looking for food. <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy, please? <br>
DOCTOR: Suppose they were there when this thing, whatever it was,
landed? <br>
JACK: It was a med-ship. It was harmless. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you keep saying harmless. Suppose one of them was
affected, altered? <br>
ROSE: Altered how? <br>
(The tape runs out.) <br>
CHILD [OC]: I'm here! <br>
DOCTOR: It's afraid. Terribly afraid and powerful. It doesn't know it
yet, but it will do. It's got the power of a god, and I just sent it to
it's room. <br>
ROSE: Doctor. <br>
CHILD [OC]: I'm here. Can't you see me? <br>
ROSE: What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: End of the tape. It ran out about thirty seconds ago. <br>
CHILD [OC]: I'm here, now. Can't you see me? <br>
DOCTOR: I sent it to it's room. This is it's room. <br>
(The child is there.) <br>
CHILD: Are you my mummy? Mummy? <br>
ROSE: Doctor? <br>
JACK: Okay, on my signal make for the door. <br>
CHILD: Mummy? <br>
(Jack aims his blaster at the child. Except it is a banana.) <br>
JACK: Now! <br>
CHILD: Mummy? <br>
(The Doctor pulls Jack's blaster from his belt and makes a nice square
hole in the wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go now! Don't drop the banana! <br>
JACK: Why not?! <br>
DOCTOR: Good source of potassium! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Albion Hospital]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JACK: Give me that! <br>
CHILD: Mummy. I want my mummy. <br>
(Jack uses his blaster to repair the hole in the wall.) <br>
JACK: Digital rewind. Nice switch. <br>
DOCTOR: It's from the groves of Villengard. I thought it was
appropriate. <br>
JACK: There's really a banana grove in the heart of Villengard and you
did that? <br>
DOCTOR: Bananas are good. <br>
(The wall starts to crack.) <br>
ROSE: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on! <br>
(But the patients are coming at them from the other direction.) <br>
PATIENTS: Mummy. Mummy. Mummy. <br>
DOCTOR: It's keeping us here till it can get at us. <br>
JACK: It's controlling them? <br>
DOCTOR: It is them. It's every living thing in this hospital. <br>
JACK: Okay. This can function as a sonic blaster, a sonic cannon, and
as a triple-enfolded sonic disrupter. Doc, what you got? <br>
DOCTOR: I've got a sonic, er. Oh, never mind. <br>
JACK: What? <br>
DOCTOR: It's sonic, okay? Let's leave it at that. <br>
JACK: Disrupter? Cannon? What? <br>
DOCTOR: It's sonic! Totally sonic! I am soniced up! <br>
JACK: A sonic what?! <br>
DOCTOR: Screwdriver! <br>
(The child breaks through the wall. Rose grabs Jack's blaster and
points it at the floor.) <br>
ROSE: Going down! </font></p>

ROSE: Doctor, are you okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Could've used a warning. <br>
ROSE: Oh, the gratitude. <br>
JACK: Who has a sonic screwdriver? <br>
DOCTOR: I do. <br>
ROSE: Lights. <br>
JACK: Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks, ooo, this could be a
little more sonic? <br>
DOCTOR: What, you've never been bored? <br>
ROSE: There's got to be a light switch. <br>
DOCTOR: Never had a long night? Never had a lot of cabinets to put up? <br>
(Patients sit up in their beds.) <br>
PATIENTS: Mummy. Mummy. <br>
JACK: Door. <br>
(The blaster doesn't work.) <br>
JACK: Damn it! <br>
PATIENT: Mummy. <br>
JACK: It's the special features. They really drain the battery. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The screwdriver gets them into the storeroom.) <br>
ROSE: That's so lame! <br>
JACK: I was going to send for another one, but somebody's got to blow
up the factory. <br>
ROSE: Oh, I know. First day I met him, he blew my job up. That's
practically how he communicates. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, that door should hold it for a bit. <br>
JACK: The door? The wall didn't stop it! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's got to find us first! Come on, we're not done yet!
Assets, assets! <br>
JACK: Well, I've got a banana, and in a pinch you could put up some
shelves. <br>
DOCTOR: Window. <br>
JACK: Barred. Sheer drop outside. Seven stories. <br>
ROSE: And no other exits. <br>
JACK: Well, the assets conversation went in a flash, didn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: So, where'd you pick this one up, then? <br>
ROSE: Doctor. <br>
JACK: She was hanging from a barrage balloon, I had an invisible
spaceship. I never stood a chance. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. One, we've got to get out of here. Two, we can't get out
of here. Have I missed anything? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. Jack just disappeared.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Jim is using a typewriter when Nancy comes in.) <br>
NANCY: Thought as much. What are all of you doing here? Different house
every night, I told you. <br>
JIM: We thought you were dead, or you'd run off. <br>
ERNIE: I didn't. I knew you'd come back for us. <br>
(Nancy empties out her sack of loot.) <br>
ERNIE: Found that old thing in the junk. Thinks he can write now <br>
JIM: I'm writing a letter to me dad. <br>
ERNIE: You don't even know where your dad is. And how're you going to
send it? <br>
JIM: I don't know, stick it in an envelope? <br>
ERNIE: You can't even read or write. <br>
JIM: I don't need to. I've got a machine. <br>
NANCY: Will you stop making that noise! I'm sorry, Jim. On you go. You
write a letter to your dad if you want to. <br>
ERNIE: I know we should've went somewhere else, but we need you, see,
for the thinking. <br>
NANCY: And what if I wasn't here? What if one night, I didn't come back
for you? There's a war on. People go out they don't always come back.
It happens. What would you do then? <br>
ERNIE: They're wire cutters. <br>
NANCY: I need you to think about that. Someone's got to look after this
lot. <br>
ERNIE: Why? Are you going somewhere? <br>
NANCY: The bomb site. The one at the railway station. <br>
ERNIE: Why? <br>
NANCY: The child. That's where he was killed. That's where it all
started. And I'm
going to find out how. <br>
ERNIE: He'll get you, and then he'll come for us. He always comes for
us. <br>
NANCY: No. Ernie, he doesn't. He always comes after me. There are
things I haven't told you. Things I can't tell
you. As long as you're with me, you're in danger. Even now, sitting
here, you're in danger because of me. <br>
ERNIE: You're the one what keeps us safe. <br>
NANCY: You think so, Ernie? Then answer this. Jim is sitting there
right next to
you. So who's typing? <br>
(The machine finally stops. Nancy takes the paper.) <br>
ERNIE: Is he coming? <br>
NANCY: Ernie, as long as you're with me, he's always coming. <br>
(She throws the paper down.) <br>
NANCY: Plenty of greens. And chew your food. <br>

DOCTOR: Wouldn't bet my life. <br>
ROSE: Why don't you trust him? <br>
DOCTOR: Why do you? <br>
ROSE: He saved my life. Bloke-wise, that's up there with flossing. I
trust him because he's like you. Except with dating and dancing. What? <br>
DOCTOR: You just assume I'm <br>
ROSE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You just assume that I don't dance. <br>
ROSE: What, are you telling me you do dance? <br>
DOCTOR: Nine hundred years old, me. I've been around a bit. I think you
can assume at some point I've danced. <br>
ROSE: You? <br>
DOCTOR: Problem? <br>
ROSE: Doesn't the universe implode or something if you dance? <br>

Serenade.) <br>

ROSE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You were hanging from a barrage balloon. <br>
ROSE: Oh, yeah. About two minutes after you left me. Thousands of feet
above London, middle of a German air-raid, Union Jack all over my
chest. <br>
DOCTOR: I've travelled with a lot of people, but you're setting new
records for jeopardy friendly. <br>
ROSE: Is this you dancing? Because I've got notes. <br>
DOCTOR: Hanging from a rope thousands feet above London. Not a cut, not
a bruise. <br>
ROSE: Yeah, I know. Captain Jack fixed me up. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we're calling him Captain Jack now, are we? <br>
ROSE: Well, his name's Jack and he's a Captain. <br>
DOCTOR: He's not really a Captain, Rose. <br>
ROSE: Do you know what I think? I think you're experiencing Captain
envy. You'll find your feet at the end of your legs. You may care to

Sorry about the delay. I had to take the nav-com offline to override
the teleport security. <br>

you should remember whose ship it is. <br>
JACK: Oh, I do. She was gorgeous. Like I told her, be back in five
minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: This is a Chula ship. <br>

DOCTOR: Sub-atomic robots. There's millions of them in here, see?
Burned my hand on the console when we landed. All better now. They
activate when the bulk head's sealed. Check you out for damage, fix any
physical flaws. Take us to the crash site. I need to see your space

ALGY: Jenkins? Sorry, sir. I don't know what's the matter with me. <br>
NANCY: Look, lock me up, fine, but not here. Please, anywhere but here!
<br>
(Algy leaves.) <br>
JENKINS: You'll be all right, miss. I'm just a little. Just a little,
just a little. What's the matter with you? <br>
NANCY: Please, let me go. <br>
JENKINS: Why would I do that? <br>
NANCY: Because you've got a scar on the back of your hand. <br>
JENKINS: Well, yes, but I don't see what that's got to do with
anything. <br>
NANCY: And you feel like you're going to be sick, like something's
forcing its way up your throat. I know because I've seen it before. <br>
JENKINS: What's happening to me? <br>
NANCY: In a minute, you won't be you anymore. You won't even remember
you. And unless you let me go, it's
going to happen to me too. Please. <br>
JENKINS: What're you talking about? <br>
NANCY: What's your mother's name? <br>
JENKINS: Matilda. <br>
NANCY: You got a wife? <br>
JENKINS: Yes. <br>
NANCY: Wife's name? You got kids? What's your name? Please, let me go.
It's too late for you. I'm sorry, but please let me go. <br>
JENKINS: What do you mmmmm. Mummy.

had nothing to do with it. <br>
(Bang! Sparks, and an alarm. The access panel has a red flashing
light.) <br>

NANCY: You just told me that was an ambulance from another world. There
are people running around with gas mask heads calling for their
mummies, and the sky's full of Germans dropping bombs on me. Tell me,
do you think there's anything left I couldn't believe? <br>
ROSE: We're time travellers from the future. <br>

JACK: It's empty. Look at it. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you expect in a Chula medical transporter? Bandages?
Cough drops? Rose? <br>
ROSE: I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you do. <br>
ROSE: Nanogenes! <br>
DOCTOR: It wasn't empty, Captain. There was enough nanogenes in there
to rebuild a species. <br>
JACK: Oh, God. <br>
DOCTOR: Getting it now, are we? When the ship crashes, the nanogenes
escape. Billions upon billions of them, ready to fix all the cuts and
bruises in the whole world. But what they find first is a dead child,
probably killed earlier that night, and wearing a gasmask. <br>
ROSE: And they brought him back to life? They can do that? <br>
DOCTOR: What's life? Life's easy. A quirk of matter. Nature's way of
keeping meat fresh. Nothing to a nanogene. One problem, though. These
nanogenes, they're not like the ones on your ship. This lot have never
seen a human being before. Don't know what a human being's supposed to
look like. All they've got to go on is one little body, and there's not
a lot left. But they carry right on. They do what they're programmed to
do. They patch it up. Can't tell what's gasmask and what's skull, but
they do their best. Then off they fly, off they go, work to be done.
Because, you see, now they think they know what people should look
like, and it's time to fix all the rest. And they won't ever stop. They
won't ever, ever stop. The entire human race is going to be torn down
and rebuilt in the form of one terrified child looking for its mother,
and nothing in the world can stop it! <br>
JACK: I didn't know. <br>
(The Doctor works on the ambulance while the patients approach.) <br>
PATIENTS: Mummy. Mummy. <br>
NANCY: Rose! <br>
ROSE: It's bringing the gas mask people here, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: The ship thinks it's under attack. It's calling up the troops.
Standard protocol. <br>
ROSE: But the gas mask people aren't troops. <br>
DOCTOR: They are now. This is a battle-field ambulance. The nanogenes
don't just fix you up, they get you ready for the front line. Equip
you, programme you. <br>
ROSE: That's why the child's so strong. Why it could do that phoning
thing. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a fully equipped Chula warrior, yes. All that weapons tech
in the hands of a hysterical four year old looking for his mummy. And
now there's an army of them. <br>
(The patients surround them, outside the barbed wire.) <br>
JACK: Why don't they attack? <br>
DOCTOR: Good little soldiers, waiting for their commander. <br>
JACK: The child? <br>
NANCY: Jamie. <br>
JACK: What? <br>
NANCY: Not the child. Jamie. <br>
ROSE: So how long until the bomb falls? <br>
JACK: Any second. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter, Captain? A bit close to the volcano for you?
<br>
NANCY: He's just a little boy. <br>
DOCTOR: I know. <br>
NANCY: He's just a little boy who wants his mummy. <br>
DOCTOR: I know. There isn't a little boy born who wouldn't tear the
world apart to save his mummy. And this little boy can. <br>
ROSE: So what're we going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
NANCY: It's my fault. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
NANCY: It is. It's all my fault. <br>
DOCTOR: How can it be your <br>
PATIENTS: Mummy. Mummy. Mummy. Mummy. <br>
DOCTOR: Nancy, what age are you? Twenty? Twenty one? Older than you
look, yes? <br>
(The bombs get closer.) <br>
JACK: Doctor, that bomb. We've got seconds. <br>
ROSE: You can teleport us out. <br>
JACK: Not you guys. The nav-com's back online. Going to take too long
to override the protocols. <br>
DOCTOR: So it's volcano day. Do what you've got to do. <br>
ROSE: Jack? <br>
(Jack vanishes.) <br>
DOCTOR: How old were you five years ago? Fifteen? Sixteen? Old enough
to give birth, anyway. He's not your brother, is he? A teenage single
mother in 1941. So you hid. You lied. You even lied to him. <br>
(The bomb site gate opens and Jamie stands there.) <br>
CHILD: Are you my mummy? <br>
DOCTOR: He's going to keep asking, Nancy. He's never going to stop. <br>
CHILD: Mummy? <br>
DOCTOR: Tell him. Nancy, the future of the human race is in your hands.
Trust me and tell him. <br>
(Nancy and Jamie walk towards each other.) <br>
CHILD: Are you my mummy? Are you my mummy? Are you my mummy? <br>
NANCY: Yes. Yes, I am your mummy. <br>

NANCY: I'm here. <br>
CHILD: Are you my mummy? <br>
NANCY: I'm here. <br>
CHILD: Are you my mummy? <br>
NANCY: Yes. <br>
CHILD: Are you my mummy? <br>
DOCTOR: He doesn't understand. There's not enough of him left. <br>
NANCY: I am your mummy. I will always be your mummy. I'm so sorry. I am
so, so sorry. <br>
(Nancy hugs Jamie and a cloud of nanogenes surround them.) <br>
ROSE: What's happening? Doctor, it's changing her, we should <br>
DOCTOR: Shush! Come on, please. Come on, you clever little nanogenes.
Figure it out! The mother, she's the mother. It's got to be enough
information. Figure it out. <br>
ROSE: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: See? Recognising the same DNA. <br>
(Jamie lets go and Nancy falls on the ground.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Give me a day like this. Give me this one. <br>
(The Doctor removes Jamie's gas mask.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ha-ha! Welcome back! Twenty years till pop music - you're going
to love it. <br>
NANCY: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: The nanogenes recognised the superior information, the parent
DNA. They didn't change you because you changed them! Ha-ha! Mother
knows best! <br>
NANCY: Oh, Jamie. <br>
ROSE: Doctor, that bomb. <br>
DOCTOR: Taken care of it. <br>
ROSE: How? <br>
DOCTOR: Psychology. <br>
(The bomb hurtles towards them, and gets caught in Jack's light beam
just before impact. Jack is sitting astride the bomb.) <br>
JACK: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Good lad! <br>
JACK: The bomb's already commenced detonation. I've put it in stasis
but it won't last long. <br>
DOCTOR: Change of plan. Don't need the bomb. Can you get rid of it,
safely as you can? <br>
JACK: Rose? <br>
ROSE: Yeah? <br>
JACK: Goodbye. <br>
(Jack and the bomb vanish then reappear.) <br>
JACK: By the way, love the tee-shirt. <br>
(And vanishes again. The spaceship sucks up the light beam and flies
off. The Doctor summons some nanogenes to himself.) <br>
ROSE: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Software patch. Going to email the upgrade. You want moves,
Rose? I'll give you moves. <br>
(He throws the nanogenes to the waiting patients, who fall to the
ground..) <br>
DOCTOR: Everybody lives, Rose. Just this once, everybody lives! <br>
(The patients stand up again, back to normal.) <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor Constantine. Who never left his patients. Back on your
feet, constant doctor. The world doesn't
want to get by without you just yet, and I don't blame it one bit.
These are your patients. All better now. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Yes, yes, so it seems. They also seem to be standing
around in a disused railway station. Is there any particular reason for
that? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, you know, cutbacks. Listen, whatever was wrong with
them in the past, you're probably
going to find that they're cured. Just tell them what a great doctor
you are. Don't make a big thing of it. Okay? <br>
(The Doctor leaves them and an old woman hobbles up.) <br>
HARCOURT: Doctor Constantine. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Mrs Harcourt. How much better you're looking. <br>
HARCOURT: My leg's grown back. When I come to the hospital, I had one
leg. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Well, there is a war on. Is it possible you miscounted? <br>
DOCTOR: Right, you lot. Lots to do. Beat the Germans, save the world.
Don't forget the welfare state! Setting this to self-destruct, soon as
everybody's clear. History says there was an explosion here. Who am I
to argue with history? <br>
ROSE: Usually the first in line.

switch themselves off, because I just told them to. Nancy and Jamie
will go to Doctor Constantine for help, ditto. All in all, all things
considered, fantastic! <br>

in stasis? <br>
COMPUTER: Stasis decaying at ninety percent cycle. Detonation in three
minutes. <br>
JACK: Can we jettison it? <br>
COMPUTER: Any attempt to jettison the device will precipitate
detonation. One hundred percent probability. <br>
JACK: We could stick it in an escape pod. <br>
COMPUTER: There is no escape pod on board. <br>
JACK: I see the flaw in that. I'll get in the escape pod. <br>

JACK: Under the sink? <br>

JACK: Okay. Out of one hundred, exactly how dead am I? <br>
COMPUTER: Termination of Captain Jack Harkness in under two minutes.

JACK: Lovely. Thanks. Good to know the numbers. <br>
COMPUTER: You're welcome. <br>
JACK: Okay then. Think we'd better initiate emergency protocol four one
seven. <br>
COMPUTER: Affirmative. <br>
(A martini appears. Jack drinks it.) <br>
JACK: Oo, a little too much vermouth. See if I come here again. Funny
thing. Last time I was sentenced to death, I ordered four hyper-vodkas
for my breakfast. All a bit of a blur after that. Woke up in bed with
both my executioners. Mmm, lovely couple. They stayed in touch. Can't
say that about most executioners. Anyway. Thanks for everything,
computer. It's been great. <br>

ROSE: Actually, Doctor, I thought Jack might like this dance. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sure he would, Rose. I'm absolutely certain. But who with? <br>
