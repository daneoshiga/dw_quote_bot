<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has a traditional sky map laid out on
the console, showing northern and southern hemispheres. He consults it
then sets coordinates. Peri enters in a demure trouser suit. The Doctor
repeats the procedure.) <br>
PERI: Lost? <br>
DOCTOR: I am never, ever lost. <br>
PERI: Ha! Wish I could have that on tape. <br>
DOCTOR: I was contemplating taking you to the constellation of
Andromeda. <br>
PERI: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: I haven't been there recently, that's why. <br>
PERI: Well, what about me? Don't I ever get a say in our destination? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Where would the First Lady suggest? <br>
PERI: Well, I don't mind. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha. <br>
PERI: What I mean, Doctor, is I don't mind where we go so long as when
we get there, we spend some time and relax. <br>
DOCTOR: You want a holiday! Why didn't you say so before? I know the
very place. <br>
PERI: Doctor, if you're about to suggest the Eye of Orion, don't. I've
heard all about that elusive place once too often. No one lives there
and few visit, apart from you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but such a beautiful moonset. Ideal tonic for the weary
time traveller. But, if that doesn't appeal, as I've said, there is
always Andromeda. <br>
PERI: Oh, really. And what's out there? <br>
DOCTOR: Some of the most magical sights in the entire universe. Astral
starbursts creating a myriad celestial bodies against a timeless royal
blue backdrop. <br>
PERI: Very poetic, but that's the exact description you always give of
the Eye of Orion. <br>
DOCTOR: It is? <br>
PERI: Word for word. <br>
DOCTOR: Does nothing please you? <br>
(He turns his star map upside down.) <br>
PERI: Yes. Purposeful travel, not aimless wanderings. <br>
DOCTOR: Aimless? You see our time together as aimless? <br>
PERI: No, not exactly. I guess not. <br>
DOCTOR: I should hope not. Or perhaps you're trying to tell me you've
had enough. In that case I can easily set the coordinates for Earth,
1985. <br>
PERI: No, no, that won't be necessary. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Citadel]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Meanwhile, on an apparently airless planet
because the stars are visible against the black sky right down the the
horizon, a young woman and two young men run down a corridor. They are
getting breathless.) <br>
ARAM: We'll have to split up. If just one of us can get out of the
Citadel and make it as far as the rebel encampment <br>
TYHEER: Fat chance. There's got to be another way to defeat the Borad
from within the Citadel. <br>
ARAM: You please yourself, Tyheer, but I'm getting out. Gazak? <br>
GAZAK: I'm with you. If we stay here and are caught, they'll throw in
the Timelash. Shush. <br>
(The three hide round a corner as guards in beekeeper nets look down
the corridor before moving on.) <br>
ARAM: Let's go. Good luck. <br>
(They split up. Tyheer walks in the direction the guards took.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There is a multi-coloured swirly thing on the
scanner.) <br>
DOCTOR: That is a Kontron tunnel. Put more colloquially, it's a time
corridor in space. <br>
PERI: Didn't the Daleks have one of those? <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter whose tunnel it is, we're heading straight
for it and there's nothing we can do about it. <br>
PERI: So? You've always said the Tardis is indestructible. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's beside the point. Colliding with a time corridor
something one tries to avoid. <br>
PERI: Well, what will it do to us? <br>
DOCTOR: You can never tell with a time tunnel. Ah! <br>
PERI: Are you in pain? <br>
DOCTOR: I've found out where the corridor's going. You're in luck. It's
Earth. It's a period you call 1179AD. <br>
PERI: Oh, I've never been to twelfth century Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: As I seem to keep saying, that's beside the point. Once inside
a time tunnel, the Tardis may undergo an adverse Kontron effect. <br>
PERI: Is that bad? <br>
DOCTOR: Bad? Bad? Doh. Bad? You don't seem to realise the effect that
time particles colliding within a multi-dimensional implosion field can
have. <br>
PERI: Hardly. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the short answer is Pow! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Citadel]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Gazak is caught.) <br>
GUARD: Right, loop him up. <br>
GAZAK: No! <br>
(They put a collar round his neck. Aram can hear Gazak's cries, then
she is shot by a tall android with a blue face. Tyheer has also been
caught.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Borad's vault]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (This place is lit with green light. The android
puts Aram on the floor and leaves. She starts to sit up, and a figure
in a chair turns to speak to her.) <br>
BORAD: So, you nearly got away. <br>
ARAM: What are you? <br>
BORAD: The Borad, your master. <br>
ARAM: You can't be. <br>
BORAD: And you have betrayed me. <br>
(The Borad presses a button on his chair, and Aram is enveloped in a
red ray. She screams briefly.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Inner Sanctum]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (An airy, open space with three chairs on a dais,
and four stools in front of them. A woman in a long purple robe walks
past two men in baggy ecru jumpsuits, who are talking.) <br>
BRUNNER: Apparently the rebels attacked a storage chamber last night. <br>
KENDRON: Why? Surely they know they can't win? <br>
BRUNNER: As surely as they know the punishment that awaits their
failure. <br>
(A younger man enters and speaks quietly to the woman.) <br>
MYKROS: They're bringing up Gazak and Tyheer. <br>
VENA: Tyheer? But Tyheer is a councillor. Mykros, what is going on? <br>
MYKROS: I don't know. Things can't be allowed to continue like this. We
are tearing the fabric of our society apart. <br>
VENA: The Borad has promised all of us a better place in which to live.
We must trust him. <br>
MYKROS: When we're losing our own friends? What sort of leader never
appears in public, only on a screen? <br>
VENA: You know that is a security measure. <br>
MYKROS: Don't be so naive. We never see him because he doesn't care.
The only thing that interests the Borad are these endless time
experiments. <br>
VENA: He is experimenting for the good of us all. He's a fine leader. <br>
MYKROS: Not only is our planet divided, we are under imminent threat of
invasion from our former allies, the Bandrils. Is that good leadership?
Why aren't we preparing to defend ourselves? Why are we having a war at
all? <br>
(The android and another man enters, who announces a man wearing a
cloak. Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201696/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Paul Darrow</a>, the
second Blake's 7 refugee in as many stories, playing this role with
sadistic relish on his return visit to Who after 15 years.) <br>
TEKKER: Maylin Renis. <br>
(Tekker leads the applause as Renis mounts the dais and takes the
centre chair. Tekker sits to his right and Kendron to his left. Vena,
Mykros and Brunner sit on stools. Tekker whispers to Renis.) <br>
RENIS: Have the prisoners brought forward. <br>
(Tyheer is brought in, then Gazak.) <br>
TYHEER: Renis, please, I'm not guilty. I led you to the conspirators. <br>
GAZAK: You traitor! <br>
TYHEER: I'm not a traitor, I'm one of you. <br>
RENIS: Be quiet. For organising rebellious acts against our honoured
ruler, the Borad, the people of Karfel condemn Gazak and Tyheer to the
Timelash. <br>
GAZAK: No! <br>
TYHEER: But I helped you! You can't execute me. Maylin, listen to me,
please. <br>
RENIS: Silence him. The Timelash will banish you. The Borad has spared
your miserable life. <br>
MYKROS: (sotto) I think I prefer death.) <br>
VENA: (sotto) What do you mean? <br>
MYKROS: (sotto) Who knows where that time corridor ends? <br>
GAZAK: Let me say my last words, Maylin. Please. <br>
(Malyin glances at a CCTV camera.) <br>
MALYIN: Let him speak. <br>
GAZAK: I'm no rebel. I love this planet. My crime is merely a concern
for our world, our people, our loss of freedom, and the growing danger
of an interplanetary war. <br>
TEKKER: Nonsense. The boy is a self-confessed rebel. Banish him. <br>
GAZAK: No, Maylin, you can't do this. Please! <br>
RENIS: Quiet, quiet. Sentence will be carried out. <br>
(Tekker leaves his seat.) <br>
TYHEER: Tekker, you must believe me. <br>
(Tekker goes to a control panel with the image of a multifaceted
diamond on it. He presses a few panels and the front of the pyramidical
module next to it disappears, and the inside lights up. A guard removes
Gazak's neck restraint and the android takes the young man by the
scruff of the neck, pushing him towards the module and finally inside.
Gazak vanishes with a scream. Tyheer is next.) <br>
TYHEER: Spare me the Timelash and I'll help you fight the rebels,
Maylin. Please! <br>
RENIS: Too late, Tyheer. <br>
TYHEER: No, you're making a big mistake. No, I won't go! <br>
(But he cannot resist the android's superior strength, and falls into
the module. Tekker turns it off. A wall screen lights up with the face
of a nice old man who looks exactly like Professor Chronotis and the
Keeper of Traken because it is the same actor, Denis Carey. Everyone
stands and bows.) <br>
BORAD [on screen]: Let this be a further lesson. I will not tolerate
any attempt to interfere with my plans. Furthermore, may I remind you
that I'm working for the benefit of all Karfelons. That is all. <br>
MYKROS: (sotto) If you believe that, you'll believe anything. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has a tangle of wires falling out of a
roundel just outside the interior door.) <br>
PERI: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
PERI: That curve on the screen you told me to keep an eye on? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
PERI: It's now a straight. Is that bad? <br>
DOCTOR: Bad? No, it's disastrous. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RENIS: That is all. <br>
ANDROID: Maylin. <br>
RENIS: I haven't forgotten. <br>
VENA: Father, is that what you now call a fair trial? <br>
RENIS: That is not your concern. <br>
VENA: To the contrary, I think that it is very much <br>
RENIS: Enough. I hope you're taking great care of my only daughter. <br>
MYKROS: Of course. As my future wife, I could hardly do anything else. <br>
RENIS: Then cure her of her stubbornness. She has a foolish commitment
to a way of life that is passed. <br>
MYKROS: I hope that she will soon believe as I do. <br>
RENIS: I'm pleased to hear it. Young noblewomen seem to have so much
free will nowadays. <br>
VENA: Father <br>
MYKROS: Speaking of noblewomen, Vena tells me that Tola is recovering. <br>
RENIS: My wife is as well as can be expected after such major surgery. <br>
MYKROS: Is there anything that I can do? <br>
RENIS: No, Mykros, but I appreciate your concern. Now, if you will
excuse me, I have some urgent business to attend to. <br>
MYKROS: Of course. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is disappearing inside the tangle of
wires.) <br>
DOCTOR: How's that line? <br>
PERI: It's starting to break up. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it still on the screen? <br>
PERI: Just about. <br>
DOCTOR: If any part of it leaves the screen, let me know immediately. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Power vault]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mykros watches Maylin Renis open a door with his
triangular pendant and go inside. Mykros dodges in just as the doors
close.) <br>
MALYIN: What are you doing in here? You know it's forbidden. <br>
MYKROS: Yes, I'm sorry, Maylin, but I'm afraid my curiosity got the
better of me. <br>
RENIS: You do of course realise the penalty if you are caught in here. <br>
MYKROS: Oh, I'm past caring. I want some answers. <br>
RENIS: No one is monitoring us in here. The delta configuration rays
would harm delicate instrumentation when I switch power through to the
Borad's personal vault. <br>
MYKROS: It's a strange feeling, not being monitored. Wait a minute.
Wait a minutes. What would happen if you refuse to make that power
switch? <br>
RENIS: Are you mad? <br>
MYKROS: You'd cripple him, surely. <br>
RENIS: You're talking of mass suicide. If we tampered with his power
supply, he'd wipe us out within seconds. <br>
MYKROS: Let him try. Look, I know we'd sustain losses, but we'd win
through in the end. We must! <br>
RENIS: Do you think I haven't thought of all this already? <br>
MYKROS: Then why haven't you acted? Look, I'd help you. Many would. You
wouldn't be alone. <br>
RENIS: It wouldn't work. Not yet. <br>
MYKROS: You're afraid, aren't you. Afraid of some power-crazed old man.
That's all he is. <br>
RENIS: You don't know what you're talking about. I am in command. <br>
MYKROS: You're only a figurehead. If you had any real authority, you
wouldn't allow loyal citizens to be cast into the Timelash. <br>
RENIS: They were rebels. <br>
MYKROS: They were no more rebels than you or I. Why can't you see
what's happening? Karfel is being driven to total destruction and you
will not lift a finger to stop it. <br>
RENIS: All I know is that I must continue my role as Maylin. My
function is to switch power to the Borad. Either you stay and promise
not to interfere, or leave now and let me get on with my duty. <br>
MYKROS: Just what does your duty entail? <br>
RENIS: There are two amulets. <br>
MYKROS: That's a mirror! <br>
RENIS: Yes. <br>
MYKROS: I thought the Borad had banned all mirrors. <br>
RENIS: Only this one remains. The two amulets must be places
simultaneously to open the power panels. <br>
(A screen rises to reveal bright flashing tubes.) <br>
MYKROS: What happens next? <br>
MALYIN: We make the necessary power switches according to these
instructions. <br>
(Renis opens the sealed letter.) <br>
MYKROS: What's wrong? <br>
RENIS: He wants me to divert all subsidiary energy supplies to his
vault. <br>
MYKROS: Everything? <br>
RENIS: All except power for the Timelash. <br>
MYKROS: He's mad! <br>
RENIS: I've no other choice but to obey. <br>
MYKROS: What about those in the hospital? Good heavens, man, your own
wife is there on a life support system. You can't! It's murder! <br>
RENIS: Rebelling is useless. We both know that. Perhaps my wife will be
strong enough to survive on her own. <br>
MYKROS: I'm going to destroy this madman. <br>
RENIS: All right, I won't stop you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RENIS [OC]: But don't involve me or my daughter. <br>
MYKROS [OC]: I suggest you think about your own wife. <br>
(The Borad strokes his flipper with a hand. This is not a normal,
symmetrical lifeform.) <br>
RENIS [OC]: If you think of yourself. </font></p>

RENIS: Android. It's all right, he was just assisting me. <br>
ANDROID: Mykros. Return immediately to the Inner Sanctum for an
emergency meeting. <br>
RENIS: But shouldn't I have been informed? <br>
ANDROID: Maylin. You are requested to attend the Borad. </font></p>

some safety straps.) <br>
DOCTOR: Belt up. <br>
PERI: Where did you get these? <br>
DOCTOR: Does it matter? <br>
PERI: Well, we've never had to use belts before. <br>
DOCTOR: We've never had to negotiate a Kontron tunnel before. <br>
(The Doctor has already hooked himself to the Tardis console. The space
inside the Tardis distorts, and so do their voices.) <br>
PERI: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Peri, it's started. <br>
(Peri gets herself attached to the console.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Borad's vault]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BORAD: Maylin Renis, how nice of you to accept my
invitation. <br>
RENIS: The pleasure and honour is mine, Borad. <br>
BORAD: I was pleased to see that you dealt firmly with the rebels. <br>
RENIS: Thank you. <br>
BORAD: Personally, I would have preferred to see them dangling at the
end of a rope. <br>
RENIS: Did I do wrong? <br>
BORAD: Well, perhaps you should have consulted me first. <br>
RENIS: I'm sorry I misunderstood your wishes. I simply went ahead on my
own authority. <br>
BORAD: You have no authority. You act entirely under my explicit
instructions. <br>
RENIS: But I am the Maylin! <br>
BORAD: From this moment, you are nothing. <br>
RENIS: I don't understand. <br>
BORAD: You think me a fool? <br>
RENIS: But, Borad. <br>
(The Borad pushes a button on his chair.) <br>
RENIS [OC]: All right, I won't stop you, but don't involve me or my
daughter. <br>
BORAD: Have you heard enough? You must be wondering how I learnt of
your treason. A microphone fitted into the black scented amulet. When
inserted into the power panel, it's shielded from delta configuration
rays. <br>
(Renis tries to leave, but the android raises its arms and the Borad
wheels his chair into his path. The Borad's voice changes and Renis
looks horrified.) <br>
BORAD: You look pale, Maylin. <br>
RENIS: You are <br>
BORAD: Repulsive? Perhaps, but I have a hundred times your intellect,
the strength of twenty Guardoliers, and a life spanning a dozen
centuries. <br>
RENIS: What, what's happening? Where's the Borad? <br>
BORAD: Imbecile. I am the Borad and I do not tolerate disloyalty. <br>
(The Borad zaps Renis with the red ray. He ages to a skeleton and falls
to the floor.) <br>
BORAD: Time for another election. Inform Tekker that I have elected him
to be the next Maylin. <br>

VENA: Where's my father? <br>
TEKKER: Oh, please be seated, my dear Vena. Accept the condolences of
the entire council of the Inner Sanctum. It appears your father has
suffered a fatal seizure. <br>
VENA: No! Why wasn't I told before about this? <br>
TEKKER: My dear Vena, the news grows worse. <br>
(The android has Mykros in a neck hold.) <br>
MYKROS: Tekker! <br>

MYKROS: (sotto) Vena, be brave. It's up to you now. The Borad must be
stopped. His strength is in the amulet. The amulet. <br>

Vena and puts his hands on her arms.) <br>
TEKKER: My dear Vena, do not distress yourself unduly. <br>
VENA: What has he done? <br>
TEKKER: Conspired with your father to bring about the downfall of the
Borad. Get rid of the rebel. <br>

DOCTOR: No. No, she was real enough. <br>
PERI: Anyone important? <br>
DOCTOR: Didn't get a chance to ask. <br>
PERI: Great. Do you expect any more uninvited guests? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Both the Tardis and the time corridor have now fully
stabilised. <br>
PERI: Was she travelling down the time corridor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I only hope she wasn't banking on reaching twelfth century
Earth. The Tardis is bound to have deflected her path. <br>

I projected an image of myself. <br>

the real me ten seconds in the future. <br>

going to help us get out of here? <br>

it'll absorb the energy used to break down that door, pass it through a
ten second time loop, and feed it back again as a beam of pure energy.
Now, that is something we can use against an attacker. <br>

before. Think back of a scientist you once befriended. Later, you
reported that scientist to the Inner Sanctum for unethical
experimentation on the Morlox creatures. <br>
DOCTOR: Megelen? <br>
BORAD: The very same. <br>
DOCTOR: Your experiments obviously succeeded. Was it worth it? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Inner Sanctum]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MYKROS: This is Karfel to Bandril Ambassador.
Karfel to Bandril Ambassador. Please respond. It's no good, they're not
answering. This is Karfel to Bandril Ambassador. Please respond. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Borad's vault]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A Morlox is sniffing around Peri while she
screams.) <br>
BORAD: Do not make me laugh, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't dare. Not when you've got such big teeth. What
exactly did happen? <br>
BORAD: During an experiment on a Morlox creature, I was inadvertently
sprayed by a canister of Mustakozene Eighty. The smell of the chemical
excited the creature I was experimenting upon, and it broke away from
its tether. <br>
DOCTOR: It must have made a terrible mess of you. <br>
BORAD: It would appear so. <br>
DOCTOR: And then the M80 caused a spontaneous tissue amalgamation
resulting in a combined mutant. <br>
BORAD [on screen]: Half Karfelon, half Morlox, but with increased
longevity and massive intellectual growth. <br>
BORAD: A glorious transformation. <br>
DOCTOR: So you keep saying. I don't agree with you. <br>
TEKKER: Show respect for the Borad. <br>
DOCTOR: Do shut up and go away. There was no glorious transformation.
You may have power, but you daren't even show your real face. <br>
BORAD: Not for much longer. Soon the Bandrils will have destroyed all
mammalian life on this planet, and then I shall destroy the Bandril
ship. <br>
DOCTOR: To become ruler of a barren planet? <br>
BORAD: No, Doctor. To populate the planet with others such as myself. <br>
TEKKER: No. <br>
DOCTOR: It appears you have a lackey with a conscience. <br>
TEKKER: You will not destroy my people. I am the Maylin now. I will not
let you. <br>
BORAD: Idiot. <br>
(And zaps Tekker with his death ray.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time acceleration beam. I don't know whether to be impressed or
disgusted. <br>
BORAD [on screen]: Time Lords to not have a monopoly over the fourth
dimension, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps not. What I don't understand is how you intend to
populate this planet with little Borads when you don't even have a
mate. <br>
BORAD: That is under control. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't tell me you've got a fat female Morlox with a slinky
walk. <br>
BORAD: Not yet. But when I do, her name will be Peri. <br>
DOCTOR: Explain. <br>
(The image on the screen changes to events in the cavern.) <br>
BORAD: The creature will attempt to kill her. When it tries to do so,
the canister of Mustakozene will burst apart and then she will become
as I am. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, very scientific. I mean, you have a really controlled
experiment there. What happens if the Morlox kills Peri before
amalgamation takes place? <br>
BORAD: Peri will not die. The Mustakozene not only excites the
creature, but will in turn destroy it. <br>
DOCTOR: This is lunacy. What do you hope to gain by creating another
miserable mutation like your pathetic self? <br>
BORAD: Choose your next words carefully, Doctor. They could be your
last. <br>
DOCTOR: Really. We shall see. <br>
(The Doctor activates his time slip device. Herbert raises the time
telescope to watch.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's time to find your Achilles heel, or should I say
flipper? <br>
BORAD: No, Doctor. It's time you grew old, and your ability to
regenerate will be of no assistance to you. <br>
(The Borads red death ray goes through the image of the Doctor. Herbert
watches him at a control panel.) <br>
BORAD: So, the Time Lord wishes to play games. <br>
HERBERT: Careful, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Where's the control to free Peri? <br>
BORAD: See if you can find it before you die. <br>
(The Doctor's double goes to the control panel.) <br>
BORAD: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
(The Borad fires at the double again. The Doctor reappears.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Borad. I wouldn't fire if I were you. If you do, it will
be a grave mistake. <br>
BORAD: Your attempted witticisms are beginning to become tedious,
Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I really wouldn't fire. If you do, this crystal will absorb the
energy and beam it straight back at you. <br>
BORAD: You're lying. <br>
(The red beam is sucked in by the Kontron crystal.) <br>
DOCTOR: I did warn you. <br>
BORAD: Another expedition into the realms of duplicity? <br>
DOCTOR: Six, five, four, three, two, one. <br>
BORAD: No! You've tricked me! <br>
DOCTOR: You tricked yourself. <br>
(The time delayed red death ray hits the Borad, who ages and dies with
a scream. Herbert shuts his eyes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Herbert? <br>
HERBERT: Who is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's me, the Doctor. <br>
HERBERT: Doctor, up here. <br>
DOCTOR: Herbert, you must go to Peri. <br>
HERBERT: Where is she? <br>
DOCTOR: In the tunnels. The passage you're in should lead straight
there. <br>
HERBERT: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: Hurry! I'll try and find the release mechanism. <br>
HERBERT: As you say, Doctor. <br>
(Herbert rushes away as the Bandril fleet comes ever closer.) <br>
DOCTOR: Must be here somewhere. <br>
(He finally tries the control pad on the Borad's chair. On the screen,
Peri's collar undoes and she flees, followed by the Morlox.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. <br>
(The screen image changes to a Bandril spaceship firing a missile.)<br>
DOCTOR: Pelion&nbsp;on Ossa.&nbsp; </font></p>

PERI: Help! <br>

Morlox then drags Peri behind him, before putting it on the ground.) <br>
HERBERT: Quickly! </font></p>

the gas canister off Peri. The Doctor walks up.) <br>
PERI: Oh, Doctor, am I pleased to see you. <br>
DOCTOR: The feeling is entirely mutual. Now, come on. We've got to get
back to the Inner Sanctum quickly. <br>
PERI: But can't we get out of here? <br>
(Herbert succeeds in undoing the harness.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've got a war to stop first. </font></p>

VENA: Why didn't they listen? <br>
MYKROS: It's no good. We've done everything we can. We must take cover
in the tunnels. <br>
DOCTOR: What's happening? <br>
VENA: Too late. The Bandrils have fired their missile. <br>
(The Doctor uses the communications panel.) <br>
DOCTOR: This is the Doctor. I say again, this is the Doctor. Please
connect me with the Ambassador. <br>
VENA: They don't reply. <br>
DOCTOR: You must respond. I am a Time Lord. I am, in fact, President of
the High Council of Gallifrey. Destroy me, you'll have more than a
petty war on your hands. Ah, there you are. <br>
BANDRIL [on screen]: Can you prove that you are a Time Lord? <br>
DOCTOR: There's no time for that now. You must call off your attack.
Karfel has been in the hands of a dictator. That dictator has now been
overthrown. You must destroy your missile. <br>
(The Bandril speaks to someone off-screen.) <br>
PERI: How close is the missile? <br>
DOCTOR: Too close. <br>
BANDRIL [on screen]: We accept what you say, and require only sight of
the Borad as proof of your goodwill. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that might prove a trifle difficult. <br>
BANDRIL [on screen]: Then there is little we can do. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ambassador! <br>
PERI: Oh, terrific. <br>
DOCTOR: Wait here. <br>
PERI: Where are you going? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Peri gets inside just as the doors are closing.) <br>
PERI: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: I told you to wait with the others. <br>
(He opens the doors again.) <br>
PERI: Well, I'd rather stay with you. <br>
DOCTOR: It isn't practical. <br>
PERI: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Practical? Advantageous, useful, productive, efficacious,
effective. <br>
PERI: Sure, desirable. What are you going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Try and stop that missile. <br>
PERI: Sounds dangerous. <br>
DOCTOR: The only dangerous thing about it is having you on board to
distract me. Oh! <br>
(The Doctor hits the console then gets underneath it. Herbert sneaks in
and hides under the console on the opposite side. The Doctor stands up
again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you still here? <br>
PERI: Yes! Look, I'll keep out of your way. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't know how. <br>
PERI: I'm coming with you. <br>
DOCTOR: Peri, every second we waste now brings Karfel into even greater
danger. <br>
PERI: Well then, let's go! <br>
DOCTOR:: That's what I want to do, but alone. Now go back to Vena and
the others, Peri. Please? <br>
PERI: I can't. I don't trust you. You're being too reasonable. <br>
DOCTOR: Then I shall be unreasonable. Get out! Why will you never
cooperate? <br>
(The Doctor lifts Peri off her feet and carries her to the door.) <br>
PERI: Because I worry. It's my caring nature. <br>
DOCTOR: Peri, I shall be gone for but a minute. Now, if you want to
fuss over someone, may I suggest that Herbert would make a much more
eager recipient. <br>
PERI: What if something happens to you? We'd be stuck here. <br>
DOCTOR: If I don't go now, there won't be anywhere for you to be stuck
to. The planet will be destroyed. Now, will you go, please? <br>
PERI: Well, take care of yourself. <br>
(Peri leaves. The Doctor closes the door then sets the Tardis in
motion.) <br>
DOCTOR: At last. <br>
(Herbert stands up.) <br>
HERBERT: Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. What are you doing here? <br>
HERBERT: I've come to help. At least I can experience the adventure. <br>
DOCTOR: I presume you heard what I said to Peri. <br>
HERBERT: Oh, but she's a girl. This is work for men. <br>
DOCTOR: Men? Men! <br>
HERBERT: Men. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, what I'm about to do is very dangerous. There's nothing
particularly masculine about throwing your life away. <br>
HERBERT: That's not what you said to Peri. <br>
DOCTOR: I lied. And as I did it so badly, I'd have assumed even you
would have realised. <br>
HERBERT: I'm sorry. I simply didn't realise. I thought that <br>
DOCTOR: You didn't think at all. That's half your problem. A
characteristic you share with most of the people on your irritating
planet. <br>
HERBERT: Well, you could always take me back to Karfel if you really
think it's going to be dangerous. <br>
(The Doctor checks his pocket watch.) <br>
DOCTOR: There isn't time. <br>
HERBERT: May I dispute that? Well, after all, what is time to a time
machine? <br>
DOCTOR: A very great deal. Should there be another day, I will explain
to you in great detail which of the many time laws I am not allowed to
transgress. <br>
HERBERT: But who would know? <br>
DOCTOR: I would. So would every other Time Lord from here to Gallifrey,
and I can assure you, they're not all as pleasant and agreeable as I
am. <br>
HERBERT: Sorry. I'd hate to think of you having my demise on your
conscience. <br>
DOCTOR: To be perfectly frank, Herbert, when I go, thoughts of you will
be very low on my list of regrets. <br>
HERBERT: That's good. It means we can stand together, shoulder to
shoulder, in the face of the enemy. I've always wanted to die a hero's
death. You know, it's funny. When I was at school, everyone used to
think I was a coward because I didn't like cricket. If only they could
see me now. <br>
DOCTOR: Shut up! <br>
HERBERT: Sorry? Oh yes, of course, you want to concentrate. Sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, Herbert, if you want to do something useful while
waiting to enter Valhalla, could you read off the numbers on that
screen you see immediately in front of you? <br>
HERBERT: Of course. This one? <br>
DOCTOR: How many screens do you see immediately in front of you? <br>
HERBERT: Just the one. <br>
DOCTOR: That's the one. <br>
HERBERT: Two, nine, seven, three. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
HERBERT: Six, seven, seven. <br>
DOCTOR: Better. <br>
HERBERT: Eight, nine. <br>
DOCTOR: Best! <br>
HERBERT: Well, how will you stop the missile? <br>
DOCTOR: I have set up the Tardis to act as a deflector shield. <br>
HERBERT: Oh, I see. You intend us to collide with the missile before it
impacts with the planet. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. Should make quite a big bang. <br>
HERBERT: Oh, I see. <br>
DOCTOR: I do wish you'd stop saying, oh, I see. <br>
HERBERT: Sorry. I just feel a wee bit nervous. I didn't realise dying
heroically was such a strain on the nerves. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, shouldn't be for too long. <br>
HERBERT: Oh, I see. Sorry. Well, I suppose if it saves millions of
lives, it's worth sacrificing two. Isn't it, Doctor? <br>
(The Doctor turns on the scanner to see the missile heading straight
for them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thirty seconds to impact. <br>
HERBERT: I assume this is the only way. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you have any other suggestions, I'd be very interested
to hear them. <br>
HERBERT: Well, couldn't we abandon ship before impact? <br>
DOCTOR: No lifeboats. <br>
HERBERT: That's a bit remiss. I'd have a word with the manufacturers,
if. Sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: Impact fifteen seconds. <br>
HERBERT: Well, goodbye, Doctor. No hard feelings, I hope. <br>
(Herbert holds out his hand. The Doctor looks at it then gives it a
quick shake.) <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
HERBERT: I feel a bit frightened now. Couldn't we postpone impact just
for a minute? <br>
DOCTOR: Impact five seconds. <br>
HERBERT: No, I suppose not. <br>
(The missile detonates in a big pink glow.) </font></p>

PERI: The missile's exploded in the stratosphere! <br>
VENA: So it has. <br>
MYKROS: It's unbelievable. They must have had a change of heart. <br>
(Katz runs in.) <br>
MYKROS: We're going to be all right. <br>
KATZ: We've won! <br>
BANDRIL [on screen]: Let me speak with the Maylin. <br>
MYKROS: You are speaking to the new Maylin, Ambassador. Please go
ahead. <br>
BANDRIL [on screen]: The Doctor has done a brave but foolish thing. The
missile has been destroyed, but so has his Tardis. <br>
PERI: Doctor. <br>
BANDRIL [on screen]: We shall make our apologies to the High Council on
Gallifrey. Furthermore, in honour of the Doctor's unselfish act, and as
a token of our goodwill, may I suggest we send down a diplomatic party?
<br>
MYKROS: Yes, of course, Ambassador. I look forward to receiving you. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
PERI: Oh, Doctor. <br>
MYKROS: I'm very sorry, Peri. <br>
PERI: Yes, I, I just want to be alone for a little while. <br>
VENA: Of course you do. <br>
KATZ: Are you all right? <br>
VENA: I don't know. I don't know whether any of us will ever be the
same again. It's been a terrible day. <br>
KATZ: It's a new beginning. <br>
VENA: Not for the Doctor or Herbert. How's Sezon? <br>
KATZ: Feeling very sorry for himself. <br>
(Peri screams. Something has got its flipper round her throat.) <br>
VENA: Oh, Mykros! What is it? <br>
MYKROS: (to Katz) Give me your weapon. Give me your weapon! <br>
BORAD: That will be of little use, Mykros. <br>
MYKROS: Who are you? What are you? <br>
BORAD: I am the Borad. <br>
MYKROS: Never! <br>
BORAD: I am the Borad, and you will do as I command if you value your
friend's life. <br>
MYKROS: What do you want? <br>
BORAD: Capture the Bandril ship. <br>
PERI: Don't listen to him. <br>
BORAD: If you refuse, she dies. <br>
MYKROS: One life cannot be bought at the cost of a whole planet. <br>
BORAD: Then I shall kill her. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not a very good idea. <br>
MYKROS: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Besides, it's not a very nice way to treat a lady. <br>
VENA: Doctor, we all thought you were dead. <br>
DOCTOR: As I thought the Borad was. So why aren't you? <br>
BORAD: I must have forgotten to mention the other experiment I have
been engaged in. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah? Not like you to pass up the opportunity to boast. What is
it? <br>
BORAD: The reproduction of living matter, cell by cell. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, cloning. Oh, you are a clever clogs. And how very astute of
you not to risk your own rotten neck. Speaking of which, shouldn't you
release your grip on Peri's? By the way, Peri, did you know he wants
you for his bride? <br>
PERI: He certainly has an original way of proposing. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll make a deal with you, Borad. Show yourself to Peri. If she
doesn't scream, the wedding can take place. <br>
MYKROS: Doctor. <br>
BORAD: What is this foolishness? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think you've got the nerve. <br>
PERI: That's right. <br>
BORAD: The woman will accept me once she is as I am. <br>
DOCTOR: Make up your mind. Do you want her dead or as your bride? If
the latter, then show yourself to her. <br>
BORAD: No. <br>
PERI: Don't I have a say in all this? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course not. Be quiet. Why won't you? <br>
BORAD: I shall when I am ready. <br>
DOCTOR: As I thought. You're afraid. <br>
BORAD: Of what? <br>
DOCTOR: Rejection. You can alter Peri's outward appearance, but you
can't change the brain in her head. Whatever you do, she will always
find you repulsive. <br>
(The Borad tightens his grip on Peri.) <br>
BORAD: Then I shall put out both her eyes. <br>
PERI: Come on, you guys. <br>
DOCTOR: That's hardly an elegant solution, and the way you've been
carrying on, you're not going to win her over with your charm. <br>
BORAD: Stay back. <br>
DOCTOR: You really are afraid. <br>
BORAD: My last warning, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: The possibility of perfect companionship shattered because of
your grotesque, ugly, excuse for a body. <br>
BORAD: Yet I have the power to kill you both. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so. <br>
(The Doctor goes over to the half revealed portrait of his earlier
self.) <br>
DOCTOR: You obviously haven't read the writing on the wall. Now,
this'll be an improvement. <br>
(The Doctor uses a chair to smash through the painting to reveal a
large mirror. Peri sees what is holding her, and screams.) <br>
DOCTOR: I told you she'd scream. <br>
(The Borad releases Peri and Katz runs to her. The Borad backs away
onto the ramp to the Timelash, trying to shield his eyes from his own
reflection.) <br>
BORAD: Destroy it! Smash the mirror! <br>
DOCTOR: What, no power to do it yourself? <br>
(The Doctor sidles to the Timelash control box and presses buttons.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're nothing, Borad. Just a self-degenerating mutation.
You're finished, Borad. Your reign of terror's over. Nobody wants you.
Nobody needs you. Nobody cares! <br>
(The Doctor elbows the Borad into the Timelash.) <br>
PERI: But haven't you sent him back to Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, to the twelfth century. (to Herbert) Where exactly did we
pick you up? <br>
HERBERT: The Highlands of Scotland. Not far from Inverness. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Thought I recognised the landscape. He'll be harmless
enough there. At least he'll have somewhere to swim for the next
thousand years. <br>
PERI: But won't he be seen? <br>
DOCTOR: From time to time. Right, take cover, everyone. <br>
(The Doctor takes off his time slip device and throws it into the
Timelash. Everyone gets down behind the Council chairs. There is a
bang, then smoke and debris comes out of the Timelash. It goes dark and
its control panel explodes. They come out of hiding.) <br>
PERI: Okay, Doctor. Fill us in. <br>
DOCTOR: Fill you in? <br>
PERI: Why weren't you blown up? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, I'll explain one day. It's a neat trick. <br>
PERI: Oh, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Herbert. Say your goodbyes. Time we got you home. <br>
HERBERT: Well, if Vena and Mykros don't mind, I would like to stay. <br>
VENA: He would be most welcome. <br>
MYKROS: Indeed. <br>
HERBERT: I say, thank you. <br>
PERI: Are you going to let him stay? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. I rather think he'll take my advice and
return to 1885. He'll tell the world, knowing Herbert. <br>
PERI: But who'd believe him? <br>
DOCTOR: Not for me to say. The waves of time wash us all clean. <br>
PERI: Doctor, you're talking in riddles again. <br>
(The Doctor takes a calling card out of his pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Herbert dropped this. <br>
(It says Herbert George Wells.) <br>
PERI: Never. Oh, I don't believe it! <br>
DOCTOR: I think he'll return to Earth, don't you? After all, he does
have an interesting story to tell. Herbert. Herbert! </font> </p>
