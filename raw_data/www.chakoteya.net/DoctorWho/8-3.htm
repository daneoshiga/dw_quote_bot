another course check. <br>

'because whatever that thing is, it's on collision course and heading
straight for Earth. <br>

BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Mister Chinn. I am personally responsible for the
Doctor. <br>
CHINN: Typical! Absolutely typical! That's the kind of high-handed
attitude one's come to expect from the UN recently. Now, Brigadier,
what about this Doctor? I gather he's not a British subject. Then who
is he and where does he come from? <br>

the device has buried itself deep underground. So there's not much that

AXON MAN: It was already too late. <br>
CHINN: Perhaps you could explain, just what it is, what it does. My

AXON MAN: Axonite is, shall we say, the chameleon of the elements. It
is a thinking molecule. It uses the energy it absorbs, not only to copy
but to recreate and restructure any given substance. <br>

DOCTOR: The trigger mechanism from the light accelerator. <br>

dematerialisation circuit. With a little ingenuity, I may be able to
join one to the other, but it'll take time. <br>
