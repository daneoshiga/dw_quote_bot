PERI: Hey, Doctor, this is great! <br>
DOCTOR: The dress is too large. <br>
PERI: Large? <br>
DOCTOR: Isn't that the accepted meaning great? Synonym for large. <br>
PERI: Spare me the lecture, please. Okay, what do you reckon? Okay for
the Royal Open Day at Kew Gardens? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, great can also denote a high degree of magnitude.
Someone elevated to power. <br>

Open Air Museum, Shropshire, two men hoist a box of stones up from the
village mine and wheel it away. The bell rings for end of shift and the
tired men walk back into the village proper. The folks in these parts
talk a bit north country-like, sithee. So nice to hear English spoken
properly for a change.) <br>
BASS: You coming in, Jack? <br>
JACK: No, man. I don't think I've got the strength to lift a toby. <br>

up and goes inside.) </font></p>

undress.) <br>
JACK: Oh, stay there, will you. I've hardly got the energy to wash. <br>

malfunctioning again? <br>
DOCTOR: Malfunctioning? Malfunctioning? Malfunctioning! After all the
work I've done on it? <br>
PERI: Well, I only asked a simple question. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed you did. It was the wrong question. <br>
PERI: Well, tell me what's going on. <br>
DOCTOR: The time coordinates are constant, it's the location that's
being changed. <br>

PERI: Who by? <br>
DOCTOR: By whom. To use your vernacular, I haven't a clue. <br>
PERI: Well, can't you override? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't try to be so obtuse. What do you imagine I'm trying to
do? That's a time distortion, as if there's a time machine nearby. <br>
PERI: A Time Lord? <br>
DOCTOR: Or a Dalek. Certainly an alien force of some kind. <br>

near the jawline. <br>

PERI: Oh, great. Some substitute for Kew Gardens. <br>
DOCTOR: Try and look on the bright side. After all, isn't coal just
fossilised plant life? <br>
PERI: What have you got there? <br>

DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
PERI: I mean, in the twentieth century. They're being chopped down to
improve farming efficiency. My generation's already concerned about the
effects on wildlife. Some species of butterfly are almost extinct.
Birds, too. <br>
DOCTOR: Talking of birds, do you notice anything strange? <br>
PERI: Strange? <br>
(A scarecrow stands on the next ridge in the middle of ploughed land.) <br>
DOCTOR: No birds. <br>
PERI: Well, maybe it's the scarecrow. <br>
DOCTOR: They're not usually this effective. <br>
PERI: Well, if the place gives you the creeps, let's get out of it. <br>

along the field margin.) </font></p>

driving a horse and cart.) <br>
DRIVER: You finished for the day, Jack? Come on, lads, out the road.
I've got to deliver this lot to pit. Come on. Whoa! What's going on
here? <br>
(The reins are cut and the men rush trap, pulling the driver down.) <br>
JACK: Come on, lads. Get that down. That's right. Get this lot off and
smash it, man. Get it out, man. <br>
(They push a crate containing a piece of machinery off the back of the
cart. The driver retaliates with a shovel. The Doctor and Peri hear the
commotion and run to help.) <br>
DRIVER: Come here, the lot of you. <br>
(Two of the attackers run off. The Doctor grabs the horse's head and
sees the reins have been cut.) <br>
PERI: Doctor! <br>
(Peri runs to a man on the ground. It's the cart driver.) <br>
PERI: Here, let me help. Why did they attack you? <br>
DOCTOR: They didn't. They attacked the machinery. <br>
DRIVER: That's right, miss. They was after smashing up machinery. <br>
PERI: Oh, well, I'm lost. Why would anyone want to smash machinery? <br>
DRIVER: They're scared it'll rob them of their jobs. <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe. <br>
PERI: You suspect another motive? <br>
DOCTOR: Let's say I'm keeping an open mind. Can you stand? <br>
(He goes to help a man lying groaning on the ground nearby.) <br>
DRIVER: Odd that, leaving Jack Ward behind. They're usually such mates.
<br>
DOCTOR: That's an unusual mark. How did you come by that? <br>
(Jack recovers and gets up, frightened.) <br>
DOCTOR: Easy. <br>
PERI: Hey! <br>
DOCTOR: Hey, steady. Just trying to help. <br>
(Jack runs off.) <br>
DRIVER: What's got into you, Jack? I can't fathom it. I've never seen
him like that before. <br>
PERI: Well, so much for playing the Good Samaritan. <br>
DRIVER: Oh, Mister Stephenson's not going to be well pleased about
machinery. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't suppose he will. Stephenson? <br>
DRIVER: Waiting for them parts he is. <br>
DOCTOR: George Stephenson? <br>
DRIVER: Aye, sir. Do you know him? <br>
DOCTOR: I know of him. Peri, how would you like to meet a genius? <br>
PERI: I thought I already had. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course, but I haven't changed the course of
history. Indeed, I'm expressly forbidden so to do. But George Stephenson
will. <br>
PERI: Could that be what all this is about? <br>
DOCTOR: An astute observation, Peri. Can you give us a lift? <br>

to come right now. <br>

WOMAN: Warn them us won't be keeping water hot much longer. <br>
(The cart with the Doctor and Peri comes into the village. The Doctor
is still using the distortion tracker.) <br>
DRIVER: Whoa with it, steady, steady. <br>
PERI: Was that significant or just a hiccup? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not sure. We did hit a bump just there. <br>
(The detector beeps like crazy as they pass the Bathhouse. The cart
stops outside the tavern.) <br>
DRIVER: Whoa! <br>
DOCTOR: Why are we stopping here? <br>
DRIVER: I'm still a bit shook up. I need a toby before I can tell pit
about attack. <br>
DOCTOR: Where would I find George Stephenson. <br>
DRIVER: In pit, sir. Do you think you could put a word in for us.
They'll be none to pleased about machinery. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. <br>
(The Doctor walks off, leaving the driver to help Peri down.) <br>
DRIVER: In a hurry, isn't he, miss? Does that mean something's wrong? <br>
PERI: It does, I'm afraid, but don't ask me what. Thanks. </font></p>

emptied tobys. <br>

(The old woman looks round the corner then goes inside. The scarecrow
throws down his tricorn hat and the last of his straw to reveal - the

DOCTOR: Machinery. Or more specifically, George Stephenson, and he is
just about <br>

DOCTOR: And I didn't exaggerate. Without his genius, your precious
twentieth century would be a much sorrier place. We've got to get in
there. <br>
PERI: That's easier said than. That dog doesn't look as though it's
been fed today. <br>

DOCTOR: To see George Stephenson. Where can I find him? <br>
GUARD: Nobody gets in here without a pass. <br>
DOCTOR: A pass? My dear fellow, I am a VIP. <br>
GUARD: Those that are attending the meeting have a special pass. <br>
DOCTOR: Meeting? <br>
PERI: We've been travelling. The pass obviously never reached us. <br>
GUARD: Then thy name will be on the list. <br>
DOCTOR: Here, let me see that. Get that dog under control, will you?
Now, what have we got? Thomas Telford, Michael Faraday, Humphry Davy.
Good heavens, Peri, do you recognise these names? <br>
PERI: I'm not totally ignorant. What is the noun for a collection of
geniuses? A bevy? <br>
DOCTOR: An inspiration of geniuses? I don't know. But I do know that
the people appearing at this meeting will transform history. <br>
GUARD: Well, that's as may be, but is thy name on the list? <br>
DOCTOR: An oversight. <br>
GUARD: Oh aye. A genius too, are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I am indeed. I'm also an inventor. Look. <br>
(The Doctor holds up the time distortion tracking device.) <br>
PERI: I must apologise. The Doctor is a little eccentric. <br>
GUARD: A doctor, is he? Well, maybe I could have a word with the
office. <br>
PERI: Would you? Thank you. <br>
GUARD: Harry! The gate. Bolt it. <br>

DOCTOR: There's a good boy. Good. Good Fido now. <br>
PERI: What are you up to? <br>
(The dog barks when the Doctor gets too close to the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's a good boy. Let the nice Doctor through. <br>
(Bark, growl.) <br>
PERI: I guess he's not susceptible to your irresistible charm. <br>
DOCTOR: Occasionally, just occasionally, your smugness infuriates me. <br>
PERI: Shush! Keep your voice down. Time Lords may not get rabies but
humans do, and that dog looks more than ready to bite. <br>
DOCTOR: Will you stop prattling about the dog? <br>
(The Doctor goes to a window.) <br>
DOCTOR: There's something wrong here. I'm not quite sure what it is,
but I'm increasingly convinced it's got to be stopped. <br>
(The window will not open.) <br>
PERI: You could be jumping the gun. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, really? Oh, that's your assessment, is it. Did you see the
date at the top of that list? In less than two days from now, a meeting
will take place here of many of the greatest practical talents the
human race has ever produced. A coincidence? <br>
PERI: Unlikely, I agree. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, hanging around an office is not going to provide the
answer. <br>

Master is about to break in. It barks at him furiously. The Master uses
his Tissue Compression Eliminator on the animal. One of the armed men
comes running up and also gets zapped. He vanishes apparently
completely, no tiny doll left on the ground like there used to be. <br>

GREEN: That's easy. He's one of brainy ones arrived early for this

MASTER: Hold hard. I intend you no harm. <br>
RUDGE: Talks funny, don't he? Hold hard? This hard enough? <br>

MASTER: Imbeciles. Are you incapable of using your brains? What
advantage do you think that'd bring you? You let the man you should
have destroyed go free. <br>
JACK: I did? What's tha on about? <br>
MASTER: In the lane. He pretended to help you. Help? He's a friend of
Stephenson's, an inventor. He's here to mechanise the mine. <br>
GREEN: Does tha know what he's getting at, Jack? <br>
JACK: Aye, he's just trying to save his own skin. <br>
MASTER: Ask him. Ask him why he's trying to take the bread out of your
mouths. <br>

the gate.) <br>

please. I'm sure we can come to some amicable understanding. <br>

DOCTOR: Please, please. <br>

making that! <br>

chain that pulls up the crates of coal but his attacker falls down the

DOCTOR: Almost at the end of my tether. <br>
PERI: That's no joke. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't thank you enough. But for your very opportune arrival <br>
RAVENSWORTH: You can thank their stupidity. I'd used up the shot. It
would have taken at least two minutes to reload. They had plenty of
time to finish you off. Now perhaps you'll tell me who you are, and I
don't want any of that flummery about VIPs. I am Lord Ravensworth, the
owner. I issued personally the invitations to the meeting, and your
face is not one that I recall. My office, now! VIPs indeed. <br>

shouldn't have deceived him. But how else would we have got in here? <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Spare me the dubious pragmatism. You came to see George
Stephenson, you said? <br>
DOCTOR: I am a great admirer. <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Yes, you must be if you're prepared to resort to trickery.
But how do I know you're not in league with these machinery wreckers,
these wretched Luddites! <br>
DOCTOR: Really, do I look like a man who would wreck machines? <br>
(Peri bites her tongue while Ravensworth checks the Doctor's hand for
calluses.) <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Well, you've certainly never done a day's labour in your
life, and I suppose it is possible you might even be a gentleman. (to
Peri) Do sit down. <br>
GUARD: Shall we get up a search for the two who attacked this er,
gentleman, my Lord? <br>
RAVENSWORTH: No, leave them. They'll have gone to ground by now. <br>
PERI: Leave them? They tried to kill the Doctor. <br>
RAVENSWORTH: I don't dispute that, young woman. A brutal attack on a
complete stranger. I take it you were not acquainted. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'd met the big fellow briefly when I tried to help him. <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Yes, that'd be Jack Ward. Over thirty years he's worked
for me and in all that time I've never once seen him raise his fist to
another man. <br>
PERI: Well, he's undergone a change now. <br>
<i>(At the pit head, a man brings poles and a woman a
blanket for a stretcher. Most of the village wait to see who is pulled
out of the pit.)</i> &nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: And the disruptions only started recently? <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Disruption's hardly the word for it. Oh, I know there have
been Luddite attacks on machinery all over the country, but here <br>
DOCTOR: It's been more extreme? <br>
RAVENSWORTH: The violence has been horrendous. <br>
PERI: Murderous would be more apt. <br>
DOCTOR: Peri. <br>
RAVENSWORTH: No, the young lady's quite right. I just don't understand
what's going on. I've always had an excellent relationship with the
men. Flattered myself I enjoyed their trust and respect. Now this, this
nightmare. <br>

RAVENSWORTH: They've obviously heard about the accident. <br>
PERI: Accident! <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Go and bring those women in here, will you? <br>
GUARD: Yes, my lord. <br>

DOCTOR: It's only the men that are affected? <br>

RAVENSWORTH: Could you prepare one? <br>

about the plant life in this area. <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Well, I might be of some use to you there. I'm something

RAVENSWORTH: Valeriana officinalis. Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
It's an indigenous herb. <br>
LUKE: Happen I can assist, my lord? Take Miss Peri to collect herbs? <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Excellent idea, Luke. Just be careful where you go. <br>
PERI: Yes, we don't want to bump into any of those <br>
RAVENSWORTH: Quite, quite. But don't worry, young lady, you'll be in

LUKE: I was thinking of Redfern Dell, my lord. <br>

MASTER: How much longer are you going to be? <br>
RANI: Be patient. Stay calm. <br>
MASTER: I've waited too long for this moment to be calm. If you knew
how often the Doctor's gone out of his way to sabotage my plans. <br>
RANI: Except on this occasion he didn't go out of his way, did he? You
contrived to get him here. Force the Tardis off course, did you?
Overrode the controls? <br>
MASTER: Do you think this plan will work? <br>
RANI: I don't make mistakes. <br>
(The Rani pours the liquid over an embryo.) <br>
MASTER: If that were true you'd still be on Gallifrey. Ugh. <br>
RANI: Experiments are always subject to the unexpected. They can be
capricious. <br>
MASTER: Capricious? Turning mice into monsters? <br>
RANI: A marginal error, quickly corrected. <br>
MASTER: The Time Lords didn't think so. <br>
RANI: Petty spite on the part of the Lord President, just because they
ate his cat. <br>
MASTER: Took a chunk out of him, too, I remember. Pity it wasn't the
Doctor. <br>
RANI: That will soon be remedied. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Above Redfern Dell]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Master and the Rani watch Luke gathering
plants. The Master draws his TCE and the Doctor knocks it out of his
hand from behind.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
(The Doctor picks it up.) <br>
MASTER: So much for your arrogant superiority. <br>
DOCTOR: A characteristic you both share. Underestimating your
opponents. Well, I got your message. I'm here. What obnoxious fate have
you devise? <br>
RANI: Why me? <br>
DOCTOR: Because he blamed you for its failure. Not this. (the TCE) Far
too simple. No, you'd have brewed something much more malignant.
Perhaps the answer's down there in the dell, where I was supposed to
go. <br>
(He sees Luke step on a mine and explode in a shower of soil and
leafmould. When the dust settles, a new tree stands in the dell.
Furious, the Doctor turns the TCE on the Master.) <br>
MASTER: No! An accident. It wasn't intended for him. <br>
DOCTOR: And you're so warped, so callous, you think that justifies it?
First you turn an innocent young man into your acolyte, force him to
betray his friends, and then you do this monstrous thing to him. <br>
RANI: Oh, stop being sentimental. What's happened? Animal matter has
been metamorphosed into vegetable matter. So what? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll be telling me next he's better off. <br>
RANI: As a matter of fact, he is. A tree has four times the life
expectancy of a human being. <br>
DOCTOR: They should never have exiled you. They should have locked you
in a padded cell. Now move, before I forget my abhorrence of violence
and use this. <br>
(The Master, the Rani and the Doctor leave. They do not see Peri coming
down into the dell and nearly stepping on other mines as she gathers
valerian. Suddenly the new tree swings its bough round and gathers her
to its trunk. She screams, attracting attention.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't move, Peri! Don't move! The tree won't hurt you! <br>
(The Luke tree raises its bough. The Doctor turns to the Rani and
misquotes Hamlet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now perhaps you'll accept there are more things in heaven and
earth than are ever dreamed of in your barren philosophy. <br>
RANI: And perhaps you'll accept that you face a dilemma. <br>
MASTER: More of an impasse? <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong on both counts. There is no impasse, and the dilemma,
Rani, will be solved by you. You laid those evil contraptions in the
dell, so you can lead Peri out. Refuse, and I won't hesitate to use
this. <br>
(The Rani walks carefully down into the dell and picks her way towards
Peri and Luke.) <br>
MASTER: She can't remember. She's probably set them at random. <br>
DOCTOR: I doubt if the Rani ever did anything at random. <br>
MASTER: But if she has, what then? <br>
DOCTOR: Then you're nominated as understudy. I should think you'd turn
into a laburnum tree. <br>
MASTER: Laburnum? Why? <br>
DOCTOR: The pods are poisonous. Be patient, Peri. Stay absolutely
still. <br>
RANI: Come to me. Keep an absolutely straight line. <br>
PERI: I don't understand. <br>
RANI: Stop bleating and do it. <br>
DOCTOR: Keep exactly in her footsteps, Peri! <br>
(Peri follows the Rani, nearly bumping into her and knocking her close
to a mine.) <br>
RANI: Incompetent fool! You're worthless! <br>
DOCTOR: Not to me, she isn't. You'll do well to remember that. <br>
PERI: She was going too fast. <br>
RANI: Can you jump without falling on your face? <br>
PERI: Sure. <br>
RANI: Well, copy me and you're out of danger. <br>
(The women hop over a visible mine and go up the slope to the Master
and the Doctor.) <br>
PERI: What was that all about? <br>
DOCTOR: You wandered into a minefield of the Rani's making. <br>
PERI: A minefield? In there? But Luke? What about Luke? Where is he? <br>
DOCTOR: He just saved your life. <br>
PERI: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll explain later. Right, move, you two. I want you off this
planet before you commit any further atrocities. </font></p>

shouting.) <br>

DOCTOR: Give me that. <br>
RANI: If they see you, they'll have no mercy. <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe not. <br>

PERI: Doctor, they're heading towards the dell. <br>
MASTER: The wood's about to become populated with new trees. <br>
RANI: Another dilemma. One of morality. <br>
MASTER: And we all know the Doctor's dedication to morality. <br>

(Peri takes the TCE from the Doctor.) <br>
PERI: Don't worry, I won't have any qualms about using this. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. Take them to the old mine working, straight along
that path. Wait for me there. <br>
PERI: Okay, you got it. <br>
(The Doctor whispers in Peri's ear. Peri smiles. The Doctor bumps into
the Master and they glower at each other before the Doctor leaves.) <br>
PERI: Now hurry. Okay, you two. Let's get going. And don't try
anything, either of you. <br>

know what she'd planned. <br>

hypnotise me. <br>

coal mine.) </font></p>

his companion are turned into trees with the Doctor hanging from the

PERI: Oh, for pity's sake, get the tablet. But carefully. No tricks. <br>
(The Rani takes something from her wrist band and drops it. She bends
down and pulls it apart, throwing a cloud of fairy dust at Peri, who
collapses. The Master retrieves his TCE.) </font></p>

begins to slip out from the tree's boughs, dropping his head towards
the ground.) <br>

foot away from the mine, he frees his hands. Then he retrieves the pole
and sweeps the leaf litter nearby with it, searching for more mines as
he makes his way out of the dell.) </font></p>

his TCE, hitting a pit prop, which vanishes. There is an ominous
creaking then the roof starts to cave in. The Doctor and Peri run back
up the tunnel while the Master and the Rani retreat to her Tardis.) </font></p>
