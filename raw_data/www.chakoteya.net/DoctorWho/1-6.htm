<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis has landed inside a tomb chamber.
There is a table upon which a corpse is laid out in all his jeweled
finery) <br>
BARBARA: Look at that. <br>
SUSAN: I am. <br>
BARBARA: It's an Aztec mask. He must have been a priest. <br>
SUSAN: Well, the Aztecs were Mexicans. We must be on Earth again. I
wonder what year it is. <br>
BARBARA: He must have died around 1430, I should think. <br>
SUSAN: How do you know that? <br>
BARBARA: All these things belong to the Aztec's early period. <br>
SUSAN: That's what I call really knowing your subject. <br>
BARBARA: Ah, well, that was one of my specialties, Susan. <br>
(She puts on an arm band) <br>
SUSAN: The little I know about them doesn't impress me. Cutting out
people's hearts. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, that was only one side to their nature. The other side was
highly civilised. <br>
SUSAN: The Spanish didn't think so. <br>
BARBARA: They only saw the acts of sacrifice. That was the tragedy of
the Aztecs. The whole civilisation was completely destroyed, the good
as well as the evil. <br>
SUSAN: Cortes landed in 1520, didn't he? Hey, look, cartoons! They've
got bubbles coming out of their mouths. Oh, hey, Barbara, look! <br>
(The section of wall with the painting on it hinges horizontally at
head height, and is opening) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Temple]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SUSAN [OC]: Don't go too far. <br>
BARBARA: It's all right, there's no one here. <br>
SUSAN [OC]: I think I'll get the others. <br>
(The door swings closed again) <br>
BARBARA: It's perfect. <br>
AUTLOC: Woman, how came you here? The temple is sacred to the memory of
the High Priest Yetaxa. You trespass and must be punished. Warriors! <br>
(Four burly men grab Barbara, then the priest sees the arm band she's
wearing) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tomb]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: I don't care if she is interested in them,
I told her repeatedly not to go off on her own. <br>
SUSAN: The door! It's closed. <br>
IAN: (in normal shirt and trousers this time) Now where is this door,
Susan? <br>
SUSAN: Here. Ah. <br>
(It swings open again for her) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Temple]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: Barbara? Barbara? No sign of her. <br>
SUSAN: She was here just now. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Platform]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They walk out onto the open sacrifice platform) <br>
IAN: Doctor, look at this extraordinary city down here. <br>
DOCTOR: The Aztecs. They knew how to build. <br>
IAN: We must be pretty high up here. Place seems absolutely deserted. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I hope you're right. These Aztecs had some rather gruesome
habits. I should hate to be carved up on that by some Aztec high
priest. <br>
IAN: The door! <br>
DOCTOR: Quickly! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Temple]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (But the door has shut again) <br>
IAN: There's nothing to get a grip on. <br>
SUSAN: There must be some way of opening it. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you push from the other side. These tombs were designed to
prevent grave robbers, not to aid and abet them. <br>
AUTLOC: Autloc, High Priest of Knowledge, most humbly greets the
servants of Yetaxa. <br>
DOCTOR: The servants of whom, sir? <br>
AUTLOC: Yetaxa, the High Priest. <br>
IAN: Where's Barbara? <br>
AUTLOC: Of whom do you speak? <br>
IAN: The woman who was here a moment ago. <br>
AUTLOC: In due time you shall meet again, but first grant us our
courtesies. No evil exists in our hearts towards you. In fact, we
honour you. <br>
DOCTOR: What is your name, sir? <br>
AUTLOC: Autloc. <br>
DOCTOR: And you are the High Priest? <br>
AUTLOC: As such I serve. <br>
DOCTOR: You know where we came from? <br>
AUTLOC: The tomb. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, is there a way through from this side? <br>
AUTLOC: The tomb is sealed. Go now with these attendants, and soon you
shall meet the one who wears the bracelet of Yetaxa. <br>
DOCTOR: What's he talking about now? <br>
SUSAN: He must be talking about Barbara. She picked up a bracelet from
the tomb. <br>
IAN: Well, perhaps we'd better go and meet her. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Platform]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Out on the platform, Susan recoils from a man
with a painted face) <br>
SUSAN: Ugh! <br>
DOCTOR: You know who he is? <br>
IAN: The local butcher by the look of him. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
AUTLOC: You have seen her? <br>
TLOTOXL: (as Richard Crookback) A vision is with us, Autloc. When does
it rain? <br>
AUTLOC: This day. When the sun's fire first touches the horizon to the
west. <br>
TLOTOXL: At that moment shall I present her to the people. A vision is
with us and shall stand before them. And I, in supplication to the Rain
God, shall offer human blood. The rains will come. No more talk against
us that the gods were against us and brought drought to the land. The
rains will come and power shall again be ours. <br>
AUTLOC: I tell you the rains will come with or without sacrifice. <br>
TLOTOXL: Does the High Priest of Knowledge only worship him who has
fallen, and not him who has made us strong? <br>
AUTLOC: I worship the same god as you. <br>
TLOTOXL: Then above all, honour him. He has made us rulers of the land.
For this he demands blood. And he shall have it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ante Chamber]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SUSAN: Well, they've treated us all right so far. <br>
DOCTOR: The Aztecs always showed the utmost courtesy towards their
intended victims. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Temple]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There, in Aztec finery and sitting on a very
uncomfortable looking stone throne is -) <br>
IAN: Barbara! <br>
BARBARA: Leave us. <br>
(The warriors all file out) <br>
DOCTOR: Good gracious. <br>
IAN: What on earth are you doing there? <br>
BARBARA: They think I'm a reincarnation of that priest in the tomb. I
found this and put it on, and when the High Priest caught me I was
still wearing it. <br>
SUSAN: So he thought you were a god? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
SUSAN: But the priest in the tomb's a man! How can you be a
reincarnation of him? <br>
BARBARA: The form the spirit takes isn't important, Susan. This is
what's important. <br>
IAN: Yes, that High Priest, what was his name? <br>
DOCTOR: Autloc. <br>
IAN: That's right, Orkloc. <br>
ALL: Autloc! <br>
IAN: Autloc. Well, he said we were the servants of Yetaxa. Is that who
they think you are? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
IAN: And we're your servants? <br>
BARBARA: That's right. <br>
DOCTOR: Charming. <br>
BARBARA: Well, it's very useful for us, Doctor. It means we can go into
the tomb any time we want to, get into the Tardis and leave. <br>
SUSAN: We can't. It only opens from the inside. <br>
DOCTOR: Reincarnations can come out, but human beings can't go in. <br>
IAN: We must find out how that door opens. <br>
DOCTOR: That's one thing you mustn't do. As Yetaxa, you're supposed to
know everything. If the Aztecs decide you're not what you're supposed
to be, then we shall all die. <br>
(Autloc and Tlotoxl enter and bow) <br>
TLOTOXL: Great spirit of Yetaxa, I, Tlotoxl, High Priest of Sacrifice,
salute you. <br>
DOCTOR: As you said, Chesterton, the local butcher. <br>
BARBARA: I acknowledge the High Priest's greeting. <br>
AUTLOC: For many days the Rain God has looked away from us, and the
land withers and the people groan. <br>
TLOTOXL: We have prayed that the land may again be bountiful. And this
day we honour Tlaloc's name. <br>
AUTLOC: When the sun's fire first touches the horizon to the west, the
people will stand before the temple in obedience to our commands. We
humbly beg, Great Spirit, that at that time the people shall see you
and know that their suffering draws to an end. <br>
DOCTOR: And Barbara will appear and down will come the rains. <br>
BARBARA: I shall do as the High Priest requests. <br>
AUTLOC: We also beseech you, Great Spirit, to permit your handmaiden
and your servants to move freely among our people. <br>
DOCTOR: O, Great Spirit, grant us this our wish, that we may be your
eyes and ears among the people to do our best and serve in all our
interests. <br>
AUTLOC: The aged servant of Yetaxa speaks with wisdom. <br>
BARBARA: My handmaiden remains with me. The others may do as you wish. <br>
AUTLOC: We shall await you. <br>
(The two priests leave) <br>
DOCTOR: A wonderful performance, my dear. Congratulations. We now have
everything we want, exactly. <br>
BARBARA: We do? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. You and Susan here in safety, and Ian and I outside
finding out about the tomb. <br>
IAN: Yes, it sounds all right, but I don't think we should take our
eyes off those two for a second. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I shouldn't mind them. They're far too bust timing their
miracle. <br>
SUSAN: What miracle? <br>
DOCTOR: Presenting Barbara to the public one second before it rains. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Platform]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TLOTOXL: Autloc, who serves Yetaxa? <br>
AUTLOC: We do, as High Priests of the Temple. <br>
TLOTOXL: What purpose then serve the others? <br>
AUTLOC: Yetaxa <br>
TLOTOXL: Would it not be better if one led our force of arms? <br>
AUTLOC: The young man? <br>
TLOTOXL: A warrior favoured of the gods. <br>
AUTLOC: But Ixta is our chosen warrior. <br>
TLOTOXL: Let Ixta prove himself more worthy than the servant of Yetaxa.
(to Ian) It has been decided. The old man may walk abroad. You shall
train to command our army. <br>
DOCTOR: Surely that is for Yetaxa to decide? <br>
IAN: Yetaxa would not refuse so great an honour. I accept. <br>
TLOTOXL: Autloc, take the old man into the Garden of Peace, that he may
sit in comfort. Come now and encounter Ixta. <br>
IAN: Who is he? <br>
TLOTOXL: Your rival to command. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Warriors hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (There are shields and swords aplenty, as well as
beautiful pottery jars. A man is practising swinging a short sword) <br>
TLOTOXL: Ixta! <br>
IXTA: I greet you, Tlotoxl. What manner of warrior is this? <br>
TLOTOXL: He is the servant of Yetaxa. <br>
IXTA: I had heard that Yetaxa again guides us in wisdom and in
strength. Would the High Priest care for me to demonstrate my skill? <br>
TLOTOXL: (to Ian) To command, one must prove oneself in courage, skill,
intelligence. Ixta has taken many prisoners on the battlefield. He has
no fear of death. <br>
(Ixta summons a sparring partner, and they fight with wooden staves.
Ixta's stave breaks and he grabs another weapon. Soon he disarms the
other man. Still fired up, he smashes a shield with his weapon) <br>
TLOTOXL: So shall other tribes fear the Aztecs even more. <br>
IXTA: Tell Yetaxa that I shall serve well. <br>
TLOTOXL: I shall carry your salutation for you. He remains. <br>
IXTA: Here dwell only warriors chosen to command. <br>
TLOTOXL: I know it. <br>
IXTA: What name did your mother give you? <br>
IAN: Ian. <br>
IXTA: Then I tell you, Ian, six warriors dwelt here. Only I remain.
There is no fear of you in me. Rather I welcome you. For one day all
men shall fear Ixta, the Aztec commander who killed the chosen servant
of Yetaxa. <br>
TLOTOXL: Let him be clothed according to his rank. <br>
IXTA: It shall be done. Is he to assist at the ceremony of the Rain
God? <br>
TLOTOXL: Ian is as you are, a chosen warrior. <br>
(Tlotoxl leaves) <br>
IAN: What duties must I perform at this ceremony? <br>
IXTA: All honour rests with us. We shall deliver the human sacrifice to
Tlotoxl. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Garden of Peace]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Why are all these people here? <br>
AUTLOC: It is our law that all who attain their fifty second year shall
pleasurably pass the remainder of their lives free from responsibility
and care. <br>
DOCTOR: Poor old souls, they must be bored to tears doing nothing. <br>
AUTLOC: We often seek the accumulated wisdom of their years. <br>
DOCTOR: What about? <br>
AUTLOC: All manner of things. Each person here has served the community
in one way or another. He was a weaver of priestly garments, she was a
woman of medicine. That man <br>
DOCTOR: And what about her? <br>
AUTLOC: Cameca? Of all those here, her advice is most sought after. <br>
DOCTOR: What did you say her name was? <br>
AUTLOC: Cameca. You will find her a companion of wit and interest. And
now I beg permission to depart. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course.<br>
(Autloc leaves, and the Doctor goes straight to Cameca) <br>
DOCTOR: In spite of the drought, there's plenty of water for the
flowers. <br>
CAMECA: Better to go hungry than starve for beauty. <br>
(She hands him a flower) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Mmm, all the perfume of the gods. I find this place
delightful. So restful. <br>
CAMECA: It is the Garden of Peace. <br>
DOCTOR: A very apt description. <br>
CAMECA: The words of Topau. <br>
DOCTOR: Topau? <br>
CAMECA: The man who built the temple. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, he designed all this, did he? <br>
CAMECA: As a labour of love. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, one senses that immediately. Does he come here often? <br>
CAMECA: He watches over us constantly.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see, he's a gardener. <br>
CAMECA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: But you just said that he watches <br>
CAMECA: So he does. In spirit. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. He's dead. <br>
CAMECA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Please. <br>
(They sit in front of a decorated wall) <br>
DOCTOR: I would have liked to have met him. You knew him? <br>
CAMECA: Well. His son lives. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, a builder. <br>
CAMECA: A warrior. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, still I suppose he knows much of his father's work. I find
the temple here very fascinating. <br>
CAMECA: A meeting between you could be arranged. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear lady, I should be so grateful. <br>
(Ian enters in full armour) <br>
IAN: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Chesterton, this dear lady has promised me to arrange a
meeting between myself and the son of the man who built the temple. <br>
IAN: Most kind of you, madam. <br>
CAMECA: Pray excuse me, then you may talk more freely. <br>
DOCTOR: Charming person. <br>
IAN: Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: So intelligent and gentle. <br>
IAN: Doctor, there is to be a human sacrifice today at the ceremony for
the Rain God, and I have to <br>
DOCTOR: Just a minute, what are you supposed to do? <br>
IAN: I must escort the victim to the altar and hold him down. Doctor, I
can't <br>
DOCTOR: Do it, man! Do it but don't interfere. <br>
IAN: But <br>
DOCTOR: There's no buts about it. If human sacrifice is essential here
and it's their tradition, then let them get on with it. But for our
sakes, don't interfere. Now promise me, please. Promise. I'll go and
tell Barbara. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Susan is trying on Barbara's headdress) <br>
SUSAN: Hey, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: Just the thing for the Royal Enclosure at Ascot. <br>
SUSAN: I'm rather mad about being handmaiden to a goddess. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I must admit that this end of it isn't too hard to take,
either. <br>
SUSAN: Isn't that beautiful? <br>
BARBARA: You know, that's what gets me. I mean, take Autloc. He's
sensitive, intelligent. And then there's <br>
SUSAN: Tlotoxl. It's incredible, isn't it? Beauty and horror developing
hand in hand. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Get out of my way. Go on. Let me pass. I must talk to
Yetaxa. <br>
(The Doctor enters) <br>
DOCTOR: Susan, please go outside and don't let anybody in. <br>
SUSAN: Right. <br>
BARBARA: What is it? What's happened? <br>
DOCTOR: There's to be a human sacrifice today at the Rain Ceremony. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, no. <br>
DOCTOR: And you must not interfere, do you understand? <br>
BARBARA: I can't just sit by and watch. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Barbara! Ian agrees with me. He's got to escort the victim
to the altar. <br>
BARBARA: He has to what? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, they've made him a warrior, and he's promised me not to
interfere with the sacrifice. <br>
BARBARA: Well, they've made me a goddess, and I forbid it. <br>
DOCTOR: Barbara, no! <br>
BARBARA: There will be no sacrifice this afternoon, Doctor. Or ever
again. The reincarnation of Yetaxa will prove to the people that you
don't need to sacrifice a human being in order to make it rain. <br>
DOCTOR: Barbara, no. <br>
BARBARA: It's no good, Doctor, my mind's made up. This is the beginning
of the end of the Sun God. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you talking about? <br>
BARBARA: Don't you see? If I could start the destruction of everything
that's evil here, then everything that is good would survive when
Cortes lands. <br>
DOCTOR: But you can't rewrite history! Not one line! <br>
SUSAN: Barbara, the high priests are coming. <br>
DOCTOR: Barbara, one last appeal. What you are trying to do is utterly
impossible. I know, believe me, I know. <br>
BARBARA: Not Barbara, Yetaxa. </font></p>

High Priest Yetaxa has returned that you may look once more upon the
sign of the coiled serpent. Great Spirit of Yetaxa, stand forth that we
may honour you. <br>
(Barbara walks forward and the crowd cheers. She goes to the back of
the platform again, and Tlotoxl steps forward for his bit in the
ceremony) <br>
TLOTOXL: Take his arms. Take his legs. Great Tlaloc, God of Rain, I
Tlotoxl, High Priest of Sacrifice, call upon you to look with favour
upon our land. Give us the water that is our life, and we will honour
you with blood. <br>
SUSAN: No! <br>
BARBARA: Stop. I, Yetaxa, command you. There shall be no more blood
spilt. <br>
MAN: You have denied me honour. <br>
TLOTOXL: Honour us then with your death. <br>
(So the man jumps off the platform instead of having his heart cut out.
In the distance, the thunder rumbles) <br>
TLOTOXL: With death came rain. <br>
BARBARA: Without your sacrifice came rain. <br>
TLOTOXL: Does Yetaxa speak with the voice of the gods or as the
protector of a handmaiden? <br>
BARBARA: As a god. <br>
TLOTOXL: Then let the handmaiden be punished. She cried out and
desecrated sacred ground. She transgressed the law. <br>
BARBARA: She did not know it. <br>
TLOTOXL: Then let knowledge be beaten into her. <br>
BARBARA: No one shall be punished for an offence committed in
ignorance. <br>
TLOTOXL: I demand that she be punished. <br>
BARBARA: No! Let her instead be taught respect for your customs. <br>
AUTLOC: I will take her to the seminary. <br>
BARBARA: So be it, Autloc. <br>
AUTLOC: The Great Spirit of Yetaxa has spoken. <br>
TLOTOXL: No, no, this is not Yetaxa. This is a false goddess! And I
shall destroy her. </font></p>

satisfied. A happy day for you. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, please. <br>
DOCTOR: You wouldn't be advised, would you. Oh, dear me, no, you knew
better. <br>
BARBARA: I couldn't stand by and watch that man being sacrificed. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you think we felt any differently? <br>
BARBARA: No, of course not. <br>
DOCTOR: Then why not leave well alone? Human sacrifice is their
tradition. Their religion. There's nothing we can do about it. <br>
BARBARA: I had to try. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and what happened? Tlotoxl lost faith in you, our lives
are in danger, and Susan is locked up in some kind of seminary. <br>
BARBARA: Well at least she is safe there. <br>
DOCTOR: Safe? Safe, my dear child? She was perfectly safe here until
you started meddling. <br>
BARBARA: Look, I wanted it to rain without that man being killed. I
wanted them to see that his death was unnecessary. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you realise he wanted to be offered to the gods? It made
him feel one. <br>
BARBARA: I just didn't think about it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's just it. You didn't think. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, go away. Leave me alone. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, my dear. I didn't mean to be so harsh with you. <br>
BARBARA: No, you had every right. <br>
DOCTOR: However, what's done is done, and now it's up to you what
happens next. <br>
BARBARA: Me? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll have to hold Tlotoxl off. <br>
BARBARA: How can I? He's lost faith in me. He thinks I'm a false
goddess. <br>
DOCTOR: No, not to Autloc. <br>
BARBARA: You want me to play them off against each other? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. The more Tlotoxl doubts you, the more you must convince
Autloc that you are Yetaxa. <br>
BARBARA: Tlotoxl won't dare defy Autloc. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
BARBARA: What about you and Ian? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, Ian can look after himself, and I think I shall know
more about the entrance to the tomb tonight. I've met somebody who
knows how the temple was built. An Aztec lady. <br>
BARBARA: You're an old rogue. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but really it's up to you, Barbara. We're quite safe here
as long as you're here. So <br>
(Tlotoxl enters) <br>
BARBARA: You enter unannounced. <br>
TLOTOXL: I proclaim myself only to my gods. Let the old man go down to
the garden. <br>
BARBARA: Enjoy the company of your new-found friends. <br>
DOCTOR: As Yetaxa commands. <br>
(The Doctor leaves) <br>
TLOTOXL: I would ask you, how shall a man know his gods? <br>
BARBARA: By the signs of their divinity. <br>
TLOTOXL: And what if thieves walk among the gods? <br>
BARBARA: Then indeed, how shall a man know? <br>
TLOTOXL: By the secrets of the gods' minds. <br>
BARBARA: It is true. Their knowledge will reveal them. <br>
TLOTOXL: How many heavens are there? <br>
BARBARA: Does Tlotoxl covet the mantle of the High Priest of Knowledge?
<br>
TLOTOXL: How many heavens? <br>
BARBARA: Thirteen. <br>
TLOTOXL: Name them. <br>
BARBARA: If the truth of my divinity lies in my mind, let Autloc seek
it. <br>
TLOTOXL: So he shall, just as Ixta now challenges the servant of
Yetaxa. <br>
BARBARA: For what reason? <br>

AUTLOC: To win a victory with your thumb needs magic. <br>
IAN: To know your enemy's weakness isn't magic, it's common sense. <br>
IXTA: What weakness have I that is vulnerable to your thumb? <br>
IAN: You'll be surprised. I won't kill you this time. Not this time,

VICTIM: Defeat Ixta? <br>
IXTA: Once, and by a trick. I tell you, face to face I can pull him
down. <br>
TLOTOXL: Perhaps. <br>
VICTIM: You drive the man. How often have you and Oftla instructed me
that small failings in a man may be his saving graces. <br>
TLOTOXL: But you, O Perfect Victim, are, as your name implies. When you
meet the gods, you will be able to tell them of the Aztecs. A commander

AUTLOC: Then these must be for drink. <br>
CAMECA: Only the gods may know. <br>
AUTLOC: And the mortals live in hope. <br>
CAMECA: He is a gentle companion, and most dear to me. <br>
AUTLOC: Then prepare these beans as a love potion. <br>
CAMECA: That would be too bold. Rather he should show his love for me. <br>
AUTLOC: You wish him to prepare it? <br>
CAMECA: Yes. <br>
AUTLOC: Good fortune. <br>

CAMECA: I greet the good and noble Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, my dear Cameca. How nice to see you again. The garden's
been a lonely place without you. <br>
CAMECA: If one's interest is held, loneliness does not exist. <br>
DOCTOR: I was merely passing the time until you arrived. Oh, this sign.
I hadn't noticed it before. <br>
(A design within a circle carved on the wall) <br>
CAMECA: It is the Yetaxa sign. In almost every building, honour is paid
to Yetaxa. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, really? <br>
(Cameca spills the cocoa beans) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear. Cocoa beans? <br>
CAMECA: We use these to barter for our daily needs. <br>
DOCTOR: What am excellent idea. A currency you can drink. Delicious. <br>
CAMECA: You know our custom? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, my dear, of course. <br>
CAMECA: The drinking of cocoa has it's own special meaning. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I agree. A rare delight. We should take a cup together. <br>
CAMECA: Are you certain? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite. Now, give me some beans and I'll prepare them.
<br>
CAMECA: You insist upon this? <br>

so. My dear Doctor, I accept with all my heart. <br>

BARBARA: Tonila? I didn't know they were allies. <br>
IAN: They're planning something against you. I'm sure of it. <br>
BARBARA: I'll watch them both. Tlotoxl's dangerous. He seems able to
bring people around to his way of thinking. <br>
IAN: You've got it all wrong, Barbara. All the people here share
Tlotoxl's views. <br>
BARBARA: What about Autloc? I'm sick and tired of all this arguing and
quarrelling. First the Doctor and now you. Why can't you see what I'm
trying to do? <br>
IAN: I can. <br>
BARBARA: Well you're not helping. Tlotoxl's evil and he'll make
everyone else the same. <br>
IAN: They are the same, Barbara. That's the whole point. You keep on
insisting that Tlotoxl's the odd man out, but he isn't. <br>
BARBARA: I don't believe it. <br>
IAN: Well, you must. If only you could stand away from this thing,
you'd see it clearly. Autloc's the extraordinary man here. He's the
reasonable one, the civilised one, the one that's prepared to listen to

TLOTOXL: I come before Yetaxa in humility. <br>
BARBARA: Such quiet words do you credit. <br>
TLOTOXL: We have both spoken hot words and thought black deeds, and I
must be the one to find a common ground. <br>
TONILA: End this conflict. <br>
BARBARA: Drink this draught with us as a symbol of our new friendship.
Then I will serve you, and whatever words Yetaxa speaks, I shall echo. <br>
TONILA: I am the witness. <br>
BARBARA: Then I accept. <br>
TLOTOXL: I hear your words and I rejoice. <br>
(He hands her the cup. She's about to speak when she spots Ian waving
frantically not to) <br>
BARBARA: Tlotoxl, you do believe me to be Yetaxa? <br>
TLOTOXL: I shall proclaim you when we stand together before the people.
<br>
BARBARA: Then I would have you perform one small service. For as I
prove my faith in you, so must you prove yours to me. <br>
TLOTOXL: Tell me quickly, that I may obey and all the past be
forgotten. <br>
BARBARA: Drink first. <br>
TLOTOXL: What? <br>

AUTLOC: And how does Yetaxa's handmaiden fare? <br>
TONILA: Her intelligence far exceeds that of the others, and she has
knowledge of things known only to the priests. <br>
AUTLOC: You are surprised? She also serves the gods. <br>
TLOTOXL: She serves other gods than ours. <br>
AUTLOC: Tlotoxl, when will you cease to doubt Yetaxa's divinity? <br>
TLOTOXL: I know she is false. She has come amongst us to destroy us. <br>
AUTLOC: Or to save us. <br>
(Autloc enters the temple) <br>
TLOTOXL: Autloc believes in Yetaxa. What of you? <br>
TONILA: I'm not sure. I do not know whose voice to hear. <br>
TLOTOXL: When I have the proof, my voice will be like thunder in the

the seminary. <br>
TONILA: She's intelligent, but self-willed. <br>
TLOTOXL: Tell me about her. <br>
TONILA: One day, in the presence of Autloc and myself, she said she
would only marry someone of her own choosing. <br>
TLOTOXL: She would not marry on advice or for honour? <br>

handmaiden to escape. He struck you down from behind. <br>
IAN: How do you know he was hit from behind? <br>
IXTA: That club belongs to Ian. Take them away. <br>
AUTLOC: You are the servants of a false goddess. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TLOTOXL: She is a false goddess, and now Autloc
has proclaimed it. Yet we cannot destroy her, Tonila, until the time is
ripe. <br>
TONILA: The people would not understand. <br>
TLOTOXL: The day of darkness is the perfect time. As the Perfect Victim
leaves this land, so shall the woman who calls herself Yetaxa also
depart. <br>
TONILA: How shall it be done? <br>
TLOTOXL: As the gods appear, may they not also disappear just as
suddenly? I shall arrange it. I had a vision, Tonila, of a room with
three walls. The false Yetaxa shall be placed in that room and the
fourth wall added. Then order shall be restored. </font></p>

CAMECA: Of all Aztec men, the High Priest of Knowledge is the most
gentle. <br>
DOCTOR: Ian didn't hit him, Cameca. <br>
CAMECA: Yet his club was found here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and as Ian has said, he was in the garden. I know, and
he's innocent. <br>
CAMECA: Yet he is to die. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Butchered by Ixta. <br>
CAMECA: If it is your wish, let our marriage be postponed. What is it
you're making. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just something to take my mind off the problems. <br>
CAMECA: Let me intercede with Autloc on your friend's behalf. <br>
DOCTOR: It isn't just Tlotoxl that we have to contend with. He and his
kind will destroy all this one day. <br>
CAMECA: How can it be prevented if it is the will of the gods. <br>
DOCTOR: It isn't the will of Yetaxa. <br>
CAMECA: The gods wish an end to sacrifice? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and Yetaxa speaks for them. But Autloc is needed here, and
he won't go to the temple. <br>

AUTLOC: Such gratitude is due to Cameca. <br>
BARBARA: Then thank her for me. My servant did not strike you, Autloc. <br>
AUTLOC: The evidence we have proves he did. <br>
BARBARA: If that is true, then I am unworthy of your trust. Of all
people, Autloc, why should I harm you? No, there's some plan here. Who
would benefit most by breaking up our friendship? Tlotoxl. <br>
AUTLOC: Tlotoxl hates you, I know that, and Ixta does his bidding. And
I am bewildered by the things that happen. I have many doubts, but in
this matter I must believe you. As for the others, I do not know if you
are Yetaxa. I do not know what you are. <br>
BARBARA: My servants are in danger. Will you see them die? <br>
AUTLOC: Your handmaiden I may be able to protect, but the young man Ian
is too closely guarded. <br>

CAMECA: As is our time together. I do not know what its purpose is, but
I've always known it would take you from me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm sorry, my dear. <br>
CAMECA: Tomorrow will truly be a day of darkness. <br>
DOCTOR: For both of us. <br>
CAMECA: Tlotoxl is determined to destroy Yetaxa? <br>
DOCTOR: He must do to safeguard his own beliefs. <br>
CAMECA: We are a doomed people, my dear. There's no turning back for
us. <br>
DOCTOR: You're a very fine woman, Cameca, and you'll always be very,
very dear to me. <br>

AUTLOC: Cameca, I must speak with you. You are sad, Cameca. <br>
CAMECA: I have just lost all that is dear to my heart. <br>
AUTLOC: The same cloud hangs over us. The sunlight of the truth is
darkened and I must know the reason for that darkness. <br>
CAMECA: Yours is a tragedy far greater than mine. <br>
AUTLOC: Yet we may help each other. Although I have lost my faith in
our traditions, I keep my faith in you. <br>
CAMECA: And I in you, High Priest. <br>
AUTLOC: See this ornament? It proves the title to my dwelling house and
all my wealth. You will take it to the one who guards Yetaxa's
handmaiden. It will serve to turn his head away while you take the girl
up to the temple. <br>
CAMECA: I shall do it. Where will you seek your truth? <br>
AUTLOC: In the wilderness, away from the influence of other men. <br>
CAMECA: You shall not search in vain. <br>

BARBARA: But they'll be here at any moment. Don't you realise that? <br>

the temple and bind the false Yetaxa. As light appears in the sky we
