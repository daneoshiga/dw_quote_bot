DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! <br>
ROSE: Daleks! You're called Daleks. I know your name. Think about it
how can I know that? A human who knows about the Daleks and the Time
War. If you want to know how, then keep us alive. That's all I'm
asking. Me and my friends. <br>
MICKEY: Yeah, Daleks. Time War. Me too. <br>
RAJESH: Yeah. And me. <br>
BLACK DALEK: You will be necessary. Report. What is the status of the
Genesis Ark? <br>
(The four Daleks have a contraption behind them.) <br>
DALEK: Status, hibernation. <br>
BLACK DALEK: Commence awakening. The Genesis Ark must be protected
above all else. <br>
MICKEY: The Daleks. You said they were all dead. <br>

with the sphere. What's happened to Rose? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I'll find her. I brought you here, I'll get you
both out, you and your daughter. Jackie, look at me. Look at me. I
promise you. I give you my word. <br>
CYBERLEADER: You will talk to your central world authority and order
global surrender. <br>
YVONNE: Oh, do some research. We haven't got a central world authority.
<br>
CYBERLEADER: You have now. I will speak on all global wavelengths. This
broadcast is for human kind. <br>
(The Doctor puts on his 3D spectacles.) <br>
CYBERLEADER [on TV]: Cybermen now occupy every land mass on this
planet, but you need not fear. Cybermen will remove fear. Cybermen will
remove sex and class and colour and creed. You will become identical.
You will become like us. <br>
(Panic stations. The army sets up roadblocks and tries shooting at the
Cybermen. A bazooka blows a Cyberman to bits. London burns.) <br>

RAJESH: Yeah, well, I can give you a certain amount of intelligence but
nothing that will compromise Homeland security. <br>
BLACK DALEK: Speech is not necessary. We will extract brainwaves. <br>

ROSE [OC]: The first time I saw a Dalek, it was broken. It was dying.
But I touched it. The moment I did that, I brought it back to life. <br>
ROSE: As the Doctor said, when you travel in time in the Tardis, you
soak up all this background radiation. It's harmless. It's just there.
But in the Time War, the Daleks evolved so they could use it as a power
supply. <br>
MICKEY: I love it when you talk technical. <br>

it needs waking up. <br>
MICKEY: They need you. <br>

BLACK DALEK: The technology is stolen. The Ark is not of Dalek design. <br>

BLACK DALEK: The Time Lords. This is all that survives of their Home
World. <br>

there'd be more Cybermen. So we sealed them inside the factories. <br>
JAKE: Except people argued. Said they were living. We should help them.
<br>
PETE: And the debate went on. But all that time, the Cybermen made
plans. Infiltrated this version of Torchwood, mapped themselves onto
your world, and then vanished. <br>
DOCTOR: When was this? <br>
PETE: Three years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: It's taken them three years to cross the void, but we can pop
to and fro in a second. Must be the sheer mass of five million Cybermen
crossing all at once. <br>
PETE: Yeah, Mickey said you'd rattle off that sort of stuff. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, where is the Mickey boy? <br>
PETE: He went ahead first. Any chance to go and find Miss Rose Tyler. <br>
DOCTOR: She's your daughter. You do know that? Did Mickey explain? <br>
PETE: She's not mine. She's the child of a dead man. Look at it, a
world of peace. They're calling this The Golden Age. <br>
DOCTOR: Who's the President now? <br>
PETE: A woman called Harriet Jones. <br>
DOCTOR: Oof. I'd keep an eye on her. <br>
PETE: But it's a lie. Temperatures have risen by two degrees in the
past six months. The ice caps are melting. They're saying all this is
going to be flooded. That's not just global warming, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
PETE: It's the breach. <br>
DOCTOR: I've been trying to tell you. Travel between parallel worlds is
impossible. Then the Daleks break down the walls with a Sphere. <br>
PETE: Daleks? <br>
DOCTOR: Then the Cybermen travelled across, then you lot. Those discs.
Every time you jump from one reality to another, you rip a hole in the
universe. This planet is starting to boil. Keep going and both worlds
will fall into the Void. <br>
PETE: But you can stop it? The famous Doctor. You can seal the breach? <br>
DOCTOR: Leaving five million Cybermen stranded on my Earth. <br>
PETE: That's your problem. I'm protecting this world, and this world
only. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Pete Tyler. I knew you when you were dead. Now here you
are, fighting the fight alone. There is a chance, back on my world,
Jackie Tyler might still be alive. <br>
PETE: My wife died. <br>
DOCTOR: Her husband died. Good match. <br>
PETE: There's more important things at stake. Doctor, help us. <br>

Do you believe I can do that? <br>
