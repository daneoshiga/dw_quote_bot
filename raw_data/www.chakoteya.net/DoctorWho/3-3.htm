and Katarina are safe aboard the Tardis, Vicki having decided to stay
behind. But Steven's battle injury's more serious than first appeared,
and blood poisoning makes him feverish. Katarina, the serving maid from
the palace of King Priam, stands by helplessly as the Doctor tries to
make Steven more comfortable. Steven lies on a divan, semi-conscious.
The Doctor is at the Tardis controls trying to work out where they may
be heading whilst Katarina hovers, concerned.) <br>
KATARINA: He has a strange sickness. Can you not help him? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm doing the very best I can, my child. Oh dear, dear, dear.
It is such a worry. This poison seems to be spreading throughout the
whole of his system. Yes, we need a special drug. I shall have to land
somewhere. <br>
KATARINA: What is that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we're slowing down, my dear. We're going to land in a
moment. <br>
KATARINA: Can we have reached the place of perfection so soon? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, I rather doubt it. At least, that is, we shall be
stopping at a lot of places before that. Now, I want you to look after
Steven, if you will, and see that you keep that wound clean. Please?
That's a good girl.

you read me? Come in! <br>
(Close by, Kurt Gantry lies on the ground, his leg in a crude splint.
He exchanges a look of despair with Vyon.) <br>
BRET: Nothing! When we get back to Earth, I'll have every fool in CCE
court-martialed! <br>
KURT: If we get back to earth. If Central Communications has gone dead
on us, we haven't a hope! <br>
BRET: We're not dead yet. <br>
KURT: Don't fool yourself. They're out there looking for us right now.
They'll find us, and then <br>
BRET: All right, all right, they may well find us, but we've got to get
through to Earth first or the whole solar system is finished. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Millions of miles away, in the central
communications control room on Earth, Vyon's call is registering on the
operations board. Unfortunately, the small flashing light that signals
the incoming communication remains overlooked. The large room is
dominated by a map of the galaxy on one wall. Shaven-headed technics go
about their tasks while the two duty officers, Roald and Lizan, return
to their posts after a break.) <br>
ROALD: So it's checkmate, isn't it? I want to see the Venus-Mars games.
You want to see your hero,
Mavic Chen. <br>
LIZAN: (a woman) I just happen to admire him, that's all. Well, I'm
going to do some work now, even if you aren't. <br>
(Lizan takes an observation chart and moves across to the console.) <br>
ROALD: I tell you what. If we tune into Channel 403, we'll get the
news. That should cover both our requirements. Agreed? <br>
LIZAN: Ah, but we may only get a report of what Mavic Chen said, not
actually see him. <br>
ROALD: That's hardly likely. The Guardian of the Solar System is going
away on holiday. He will, no doubt, say a few well-chosen words. Every
well-chosen word will no doubt be transmitted. <br>
LIZAN: And what about the routine calls? <br>
ROALD: Oh, you worry too much. The next one's Five Zero Alpha. <br>
LIZAN: Five Zero Alpha? <br>
ROALD: It's not for another twenty minutes. Well, what about 403? <br>
LIZAN: Bring up 403 please. Five Zero Alpha? Is that the patrol out
looking for Marc Cory? <br>
ROALD: Yes, the agent who disappeared near the planet Kembel. Probably
crashed, so they think. Hey, bring up the sound! It's Mavic Chen on
holiday. <br>
CHEN [OC]: Yes. The mineral agreement with the fourth galaxy proved a
little more complicated than was at first expected. <br>
INTERVIEWER [OC]: And as that has been concluded so successfully, I'm
sure that no one will begrudge you little time off. Where are you going
to on this trip? <br>
CHEN [OC]: That I am keeping a secret. I hope to be able to get away
from all interviewers. I'm just going to climb aboard my Spar and drift
about the solar system. <br>
LIZAN: Drifting round the solar system! That's the life if you can get
it. <br>
ROALD: Well, become a galactic politician and who knows? Maybe one day
you will. As far as I'm concerned, give me terra firma any day. <br>
LIZAN: You are in a rut, my friend. Now if I had the latest Flip T-4, I
<br>
ROALD: It's a trifle brash, isn't it? There are other space vessels,
you know. <br>
LIZAN: You mean the Spar 740? <br>
ROALD: Yes. If I had to travel around ultra-space, I'd think the 740.
Elegance, plus ultimate technology. <br>
LIZAN: It hasn't got the speed. <br>
ROALD: Speed isn't everything. <br>
INTERVIEWER [OC]: Is there anything you would like to say to the
citizens before you depart? <br>
CHEN [OC]: Yes. It is my earnest hope that the solar system may
continue along this path of peace, this path that was laid by the
signing of the non-aggression pact of 3975. Now, in this year of 4000,
we can feel justly proud of that pact. May the past twenty five years
prove that they are the dawn of an everlasting peace which will spread
throughout the universe. Let us go forward together, secure in the
knowledge that the life ahead is built on the cornerstone of richer
understanding, not only of the past or of the present, but also of the
future. And may it be this cornerstone, so firmly laid, be built upon
in brotherhood and bring peace, progress and prosperity to each and
every one of us. <br>
INTERVIEWER [OC]: Thank you sir. I'm sure that all throughout our
system echo your thoughts. <br>
LIZAN: Even you must agree he's an impressive man. <br>
ROALD: Yes, it's nice to hear his speech again. <br>
LIZAN: Cynic. <br>
LIZAN: Was that a flash? <br>
ROALD: Where? There's nothing coming through. <br>
LIZAN: I thought I saw one. <br>
ROALD: You're imagining things. <br>
LIZAN: Okay, so I'm imagining things.

nervously into the jungle.) <br>
KURT: They are out there, I know it. And they're getting closer. <br>
BRET: You're imagining things. Now shut up. <br>
KURT: Do you think I'm a fool? There's something out there and it's
close. <br>
BRET: Look, I tell you <br>
KURT: Just listen. There. <br>
BRET: Shh! <br>
KURT: You heard it? <br>
BRET: Yes. Come on, we've got to get out of here. <br>
KURT: I stay. <br>
BRET: What? But you know we can't fight them. Our weapons are useless
against those things. Now we must move out. <br>
KURT: How can I keep on the move with this? Have you got any more
bright ideas? All that will happen is I'll hit one of those spiked
plants. I nearly fell on one before. <br>
BRET: We won't go fast, just keep moving. I'll make sure we avoid the
Varga plants. <br>
KURT: If I fall and hit one, you know what happens then. <br>
BRET: Don't be a fool! <br>
KURT: That could be what happened to Cory. He tripped, pricked himself
on a thorn, and then he turned into one. <br>
BRET: You're letting your imagination run riot again. Besides, we
haven't seen any Varga that look like him. <br>
KURT: Joke away, but you know I'm right. There's been no trace of Marc
Cory anywhere. <br>
BRET: Perhaps they took him prisoner. <br>
KURT: You know they don't take prisoners. <br>
BRET: All the more reason for you to come with me. Now come on. <br>
(Bret moves to help Kurt to his feet, but Kurt pushes him away
angrily.) <br>
KURT: This is no time for phony heroics. I'll just slow you down, and
then we'll both get it. Now without me you've got a chance. It's not a
good one, but it's a chance. Just stay alive and get that message
through. <br>
BRET: I'm not going without you, is that clear? <br>
KURT: Get out! Get out of here or I'll kill you now! <br>
(Kurt presses his gun into Vyon's chest. Bret is shocked, but realises
his friend is deadly serious and moves to pick up the transmitter
before walking to the edge of the clearing.) <br>
KURT: Bret. Good luck. <br>
(Vyon nods briefly, then quickly turns and disappears into the jungle.
Kurt moves awkwardly to a better defensive position, his gun levelled
at the darkness of the forest.) <br>
KURT: All right, I'm ready for you now. <br>
(There's no response from the depths of the jungle. Kurt stares around
wildly, becoming more and more unsettled.) <br>
KURT: Where the devil are you? Come on! <br>
(Behind him, there's a trembling of leaves, and a dark shape emerges
from the jungle. A Dalek. As Kurt falls lifeless to the ground, the
second Dalek glides out of the forest and scans the area.) <br>
DALEK 2: One man remains. Find and destroy him! <br>
DALEK 1: I obey! <br>
(The Daleks glide away. Dashing through the dark jungle, Bret Vyon
dodges to avoid a couple of Varga plants but then trips and crashes to
the ground, smashing his radio transmitter. Vyon picks up the useless
piece of equipment and looks at it in despair. As he tries to work out
what to do next, a strange noise disturbs him. At the edge of the
clearing, Bret watches in amazement as the Tardis materialises. He
approaches the blue box cautionsly, ducking back out of sight when the
door opens. The Doctor emerges, followed by Katarina.) <br>
KATARINA: Strange place. Can you find help here? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know my dear, but I must try. Now, I want you to stay
here and look after Steven. I shall be as quick as I can. <br>
KATARINA: I'll do as you ask. <br>
DOCTOR: Splendid. Now you know which switch to pull to close the doors,
don't you, so I want you to do that straight away. I have my key to let
myself in. <br>
KATARINA: Key? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. This, child. Key. This opens the door from the outside.
Now go in please, and shut the door. Charming.

surrounded by dense jungle. i<br>
DOCTOR: Ah. A city or perhaps a town. I wonder where we are? All I have
to do is get through that jungle and perhaps then I can get some help.
I must say it's a strange place to put a city. <br>

BRET: Keep absolutely still. <br>

when that Trojan <br>
KATARINA: Deep calm. You must rest. <br>
STEVEN: Did the Doctor bring you on board? <br>
KATARINA: Yes. We all make the journey together. <br>
STEVEN: Who are you? <br>
KATARINA: Katarina. I served as handmaid to the High Priestess
Cassandra. But you must rest. The Doctor will bring help. Don't ask any
more questions. <br>
STEVEN: I, I want. <br>
(Steven passes out again as the doors open. Katarina turns in surprise
to see Bret enter the Tardis.) <br>
KATARINA: Did the Doctor sent you? <br>
BRET: That's right. The old man sent me. <br>
KATARINA: Have you bought help? <br>
BRET: This is fantastic. You, what's your name? <br>
KATARINA: Katarina. Did the Doctor send you to cure the sickness? <br>
BRET: Yes, but we must shut the doors first. The old man said you knew
the switch. <br>
KATARINA: Yes, here. <br>
(As Katarina closes the doors, Bret continues to gaze around the
outsized Tardis interior in amazement.) <br>
BRET: What sort of craft is this? I've seen most, but nothing like
this. From the outside it looked so small. How do you work this thing? <br>
KATARINA: Only the Doctor works his temple. <br>
BRET: His what? <br>
(Bret tries a few switches.) <br>
KATARINA: You must help Steven. <br>
BRET: Yes, yes, of course I'll help Steven, but we must get back to
Earth first. I explained this to the old man, the, er, Doctor. <br>
(But the agent only succeeds in unknowingly activating the exterior
scanner.) <br>
KATARINA: We can't go back to Earth, we've left it. <br>
BRET: That means we can get back? <br>
(Coming round once more, Steven struggles to understand what's
happening. On the scanner, he can see the Doctor approaching outside.) <br>
BRET: Katarina, are you sure you don't know how to work this? <br>
KATARINA: How could I know? It belongs to the Doctor. <br>
BRET: The old man said this was no ordinary ship, and he was right.

well, that's the first big mistake, isn't it? Yes, very foolish. Very

DOCTOR: How is he, my dear? <br>
KATARINA: He's asleep. <br>

to ascertain it's locale, that young ruffian set about me. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh yes, I hope so. Just a minute. That young man, did he say
anything? <br>

ZEPHON: I am Zephon, Master of the Fifth Galaxy. <br>
CHEN: Of course. I had hoped to meet you once before, at the
Intergalactic Conference of Andromeda. <br>
ZEPHON: I did not attend, and now you know the reason. The Daleks held
a separate council at the same time. None of us of the outer galaxies
went to yours. <br>
CHEN: Except Trantis. <br>
ZEPHON: We agreed to send a delegate in order that the conference
should not become suspicious. <br>
CHEN: I've been reading the reports on the previous meetings here. The
Daleks have evolved a most interesting plan. <br>
ZEPHON: We of the outer galaxies have contributed to it also. <br>
CHEN: Of course. But you must admit the Daleks have a genius for war. <br>
ZEPHON: That is so. However, one thing surprises me. That you, Guardian
of the Solar System, have agreed to become one of us. <br>
CHEN: Why the surprise? As you say, I am Guardian of the Solar System.
But that is nothing more than a part, however influential, of one
galaxy. Would you be satisfied with just a part of a galaxy? <br>
ZEPHON: The solar system is exceptional. In its power lies influences
far outside its own sphere. Surely by joining with the forces
determined to destroy that power, you mark yourself up as a supreme
traitor? <br>
CHEN: Traitor? (laughs) An archaic word for so advanced a man as
yourself. Considering that the planet Fisar and the Embodiment Gris
have both, at different times, tried to depose you, do you still
maintain that you're the mouthpiece for your own galaxy? <br>
ZEPHON: I do, now that I am all-powerful with my position. <br>

within our solar system. Now let us go and take some air. This is
hardly the time or the place for so serious a discussion. <br>

KATARINA: You must rest. The tablets I gave you have made you better,
but you must still rest. <br>
STEVEN: Tablets? What's going on here? What are we doing out here in
the jungle? <br>
KATARINA: We had to leave the temple. The Tardis. The evil ones came. <br>
STEVEN: Evil ones? <br>
KATARINA: He called them the Daleks? <br>
STEVEN: Daleks! <br>

Katarina watches over him with some concern when a small sound behind
her makes her turn. The bushes part and the Doctor emerges.) <br>
DOCTOR: Katarina! <br>
KATARINA: My lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor. Doctor. What are you both doing here? <br>
KATARINA: The evil ones searched for us but Bret helped us. He said
they were evil. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, whoever this Bret is, he's quite right. The Daleks
are evil things. <br>
KATARINA: Bret is the man you put in your magic chair. <br>
DOCTOR: What? That young ruffian? <br>
KATARINA: But he helped us. <br>
DOCTOR: And you released him? <br>
KATARINA: Was I not right to do so? When the evil ones came he said we
had to flee from your temple. <br>
DOCTOR: Girl, my Tardis, child, my Tardis. Yes, you were right. I mean,
he wasn't to know that you were quite safe away from the Daleks in
there. How is this young man? <br>
STEVEN: I'll be all right in a minute or two, thanks, Doc. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good, good. <br>
KATARINA: Bret says the time is four thousand, and he came here and
only just got away from the evil ones. He gave Steven some white
tablets, and he's almost well again. <br>
DOCTOR: I see, I see. Yes, and I clamped him in that chair, and he's
the very fellow with the antitoxin. Well, young man, you'd better pull
yourself together. We've got some work to do. <br>
(Hiding in the bushes, looking down into the clearing towards the
Tardis, Bret watches as two more Daleks, both carrying flame-throwing
equipment instead of sink-plungers, join the rest of the patrol.) <br>
DALEK 1: Operate pyro-flames! <br>
DALEKS 2 + 3: We obey! <br>
(The Daleks turn their flame-throwers on the surrounding jungle and
instantly the trees are ignited, trailing fire down into the
undergrowth. In seconds an inferno is raging, spreading and growing
into a curtain of flame. Horrified, Bret scrambles to his feet and
hurries back to the place he left Katarina and Steven. A little way
off, the Doctor and his companions are as yet unaware of the danger
they're in. Steven is struggling to get to his feet as Bret
approaches.) <br>
DOCTOR: Aren't you feeling better? <br>
STEVEN: Look, Doctor, I think I can manage on my own. <br>
DOCTOR: Carefully, carefully. Now, just rest for a minute. Take a few
deep breaths. Don't you try to run before you can walk, although you
might have to. Oh, it's Bret, isn't it? Yes, thank you. Tell me what's
happening? <br>
BRET: It's the Daleks, they're using flame guns. I think they're going
to burn down the jungle. <br>
DOCTOR: Good gracious me. We must try to get back to the Tardis. We're
in grave danger here. <br>
STEVEN: Doctor, don't you see? It's a trap. That's exactly what they
want us to do. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, possibly, possibly. <br>
STEVEN: We can't act without thinking. <br>
DOCTOR: I never do and never shall. <br>
STEVEN: You were all set to go straight back to the Tardis. <br>
KATARINA: He said we should never have left it. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, my dear. It's the safest place. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, yes. If the Daleks are waiting outside for us, it will be
suicide. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, not necessarily, not. <br>
STEVEN: Who's going to play the scapegoat? <br>
KATARINA: Supposing Steven were right? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, in this instance, child, he might be, but I know the
Daleks. <br>
STEVEN: So do I, Doctor. Look, I say we should stay here until we know
exactly what they're going to do. <br>
DOCTOR: They could track us down at any time. <br>
STEVEN: We'd hear them. I mean, the Mechanoids <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, they were robots. <br>
STEVEN: So what? <br>
DOCTOR: These are Daleks. Now you listen to me, young man, I am in
charge of this situation. <br>
BRET: Sir! Will you shut up! At least that's stopped you arguing. <br>
DOCTOR: Well upon my soul. <br>
BRET: Now, look here, I don't care what happens to you, but I have got
to warn Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and you will have to do far more than that. If the Daleks
are doing something drastic, then we have to stop the Daleks. Now will
you shut up, sir? <br>
(The Daleks spread out, relentlessly blasting at the undergrowth.
Unchecked, the fire spreads quickly, enveloping more and more of the
forest. Jungle creatures begin to howl and screech in panic, and a
think paul of black smoke rises. blotting out the stars. As the fire
rages closer, the Doctor and Bret are still arguing about what to do
next.) <br>
BRET: One, learn the Dalek plans. <br>
DOCTOR: We know, young man. <br>
BRET: And two, get the information back to Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Now just listen, listen, listen. Think back for a moment. Just
think back. If the Daleks were going to attack Earth, as you seem to
fear, then you must tell Earth to look back in the history of the year
2157, and that the Daleks are going to attack again. History will show
how to deal with them. <br>
BRET: Who cares about history? <br>
DOCTOR: Now listen <br>
STEVEN: I can smell smoke. Yes, look! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, you're quite right, young man. They're going to trap
us. <br>
KATARINA: Doctor, it's like the wall of fire. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no. Not quite, not quite, my dear. We've got to get
out of here. Come on. This way. <br>
BRET: What? That's the way to the Dalek city. <br>

signalling the others to stay down. About twenty feet away, delegate
Zephon is still transfixed by the fire on the horizon. Slowly he moves
forward, coming nearer to the Doctor's hiding place. Bret edges towards
the Doctor, signing as he approaches. The Doctor presses back against

great universal council, I am delighted to be able to make so
significant a contribution to our conquest of the universe. I now
present you with the core of the time destructor. A full emm of
taranium, the rarest mineral in the universe. It's taken fifty Earth
years to acquire even this amount. <br>
TRANTIS: If it has taken so long for the solar system to acquire it,
why was not one of us of the outer galaxies asked to provide it? <br>
CHEN: As the Daleks know, taranium can only be found on one of the dead
planets of the solar system. Without this, the time destructor is
useless. All the plans made here could not succeed. I, Mavic Chen, give
you the core of the time destructor. <br>

to tell us something. Katarina! Come over here, my child. Now, have a
look at another wonder. <br>
KATARINA: Everything is so strange. This isn't like your Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: No, my dear, no. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, but Doctor, surely, I mean, the Daleks aren't going to
leave a tape around with their plans on it? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Bret here was searching for someone and the
skeleton I found was humanoid. Well, whoever it was may learned
something that we haven't. <br>
BRET: Marc Cory! You found him? Well, Kurt and I searched that jungle
but we could find no trace. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, did you search that pairing twice? <br>

DOCTOR: Well, it so happens that kind of jungle is apt to lead you back
to the same place more than once. <br>
BRET: Yes but we were methodical or as methodical as the Daleks. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes no doubt you were and I suppose I was lucky. Now play
the tape. Come along, come along, stop all this talking. <br>

the planet Kembel. <br>

unfortunate enough to be sent there. In a dank gloomy cave three men
sit around a rough table engaged in a power struggle that focuses on a
crude knife stuck into the centre. After a brief and violent tussle
Bors is victorious, and tucks the knife into his belt, nodding coarsely
at two women in the corner.) <br>

(Garge looks sourly at Bors then, grumbling to himself picks up a crude
club and leaves the cave. His leadership confirmed for now, Bors
settles down to sleep. Outside, winged creatures wheel and turn in the
darkening sky as Garge settles down to guard duty. Soon all is quiet.
Kirksen, who is still smarting from his earlier humiliation, cannot
sleep, but when he's sure that Bors is asleep, Kirksen edges around the
cave stealthily crawling across the floor to where Bors is lying. He
reaches for the knife in Bors' belt. Bors is instantly awake and grabs
Kirksen roughly by the wrist.) <br>
BORS: And you can build up the fire. Kirksen, like the knife, would
you? Then you'd be leader. You could tell Garge what to do, like I do.
You can tell me what to do! <br>

City must be cordoned off until they are found. And Lizan! They will be
killed on sight. Give out the instructions. <br>

DOCTOR: No. And remember, you cannot fire because of the taranium.
You'd have another fifty years work. <br>
CHEN: Possibly, But you are still in no position to bargain. <br>
DOCTOR: I will hand over the taranium outside my ship, the Tardis. <br>

DOCTOR [OC]: Steven, hand the box over to Chen. Then come inside the

delighted when he opens the box and has to shield his eyes against the

rays bouncing off his forcefield, and the door slams shut. The Tardis

STEVEN: Yes, more or less. <br>
DOCTOR: The Dalek guns must have destroyed that forcefield completely.
It's a good thing they didn't fire a second time. <br>
STEVEN: I don't really know what happened. <br>
SARA: You were enclosed in a field of Gravity force and reliance power.

DOCTOR: You had a shield round you. You know, similar to that one that
protects the Tardis. Oh, that's remind me. Where is that genuine
Taranium? <br>
SARA: Over here. <br>
STEVEN: It's a pity I blacked out. I mean, if I knew the ratio
readings, we could use the same force again to protect us from the
Daleks. <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly not! What you did was very dangerous and extremely
stupid. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, come off it. It worked. <br>
DOCTOR: One more experiment like that and you really will be dead. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, nonsense. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, now, you listen to me, young man. I warned you it was
dangerous before you tried it. You might have killed yourself and blown
up the space-ship. Then, where would we all be? <br>
STEVEN: I know where I'll be. I don't know about you lot. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, now, now don't be cheeky. <br>
STEVEN: Look, if it haven't been for me, how would you have charged the
taranium and carried out the hand-over? I think we should experiment
further. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't care what you think. We're not going to repeat it. Why
do you think science turned down your discovery? Because it isn't safe.
So perhaps in future you'll pay attention to what I say and remember
that I happen to be the leader of this expedition and I don't want to
keep on repeating myself. <br>
STEVEN: But Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind the buts! If you don't like it, you can get off! <br>
STEVEN: All right Doctor, I promise that I won't experiment with it any
further. <br>

SARA: Something's gone wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter? <br>
SARA: It's stopped going up and down. <br>
STEVEN: That's means that we've landed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, tut, tut, tut. That scanner's not working. <br>
SARA: Can you mend it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes I shall have to repair it, of course, yes, yes, but that
means checking up on the whole circuit. <br>
STEVEN: Well, let's get on with it. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, ah, ah. Don't you dare touch that. <br>
STEVEN: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, just look at those dials. Look! Look here, Sara. You see
those dials, now you know what that means? If either of you went
outside, it would be extremely dangerous. The whole atmosphere is
entirely poisonous.

DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite, quite. Tell me, any plans? <br>
MONK: And all carried out as well. Oh, ho. Doctor, you remember you
left me in 1066? Now I've marooned you on the planet Tigus. Look! Oh,
it's funny this. Forgive me laughing, Doctor, but I don't seem to be
able to control it. Well, goodbye, Doctor. Perhaps I'll come back one
day and rescue you. <br>

CHEN: Though we are all equal partners with the Daleks on this great
conquest, some of us are more equal than others. <br>
BEAUS: The Representative speaks out of turn! <br>
CHEN: No! My contribution of the emm of taranium, is greater than all
of yours put together. You have been dwarfed, dwarfed! <br>

assembled. <br>
BEAUS: Arrest him! Arrest him! Arrest him! <br>
CHEN: You have no power to arrest anybody. You are nothing, do you hear
me? Nothing! <br>
(The council members are united in their condemnation of Chen's
ambition. The representatives are all on their feet, shouting. Giron
moves forward to attack Chen. There's the sound of a weapon and Giron
crumples to the floor. Smiling, Chen stands over Giron's fallen body, a
blaster in his hand. The other delegates are stunned into
silence.)&nbsp;<br>
CHEN: Before this conference began, the Dalek Supreme and I spoke
together. This Council now is under my power. I will give the orders.
You will obey them.

recovery of the core of the time destructor. Because of this, I
naturally precede anyone here. For without my power, the Daleks cannot
succeed. You do appreciate the point. <br>

all of you will be responsible to the Dalek Supreme and me. <br>

Doctor meets Sara.) <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing here? <br>
SARA: I came to help you. <br>
DOCTOR: You must remember, my child, this machine is working. It's
working slowly because its range is rather small at the moment, but it
is working. Now, if you start to feel strange, you must let me know at
once. <br>
SARA: Yes, all right, but what about them? <br>
DOCTOR: First, back to the Tardis. Is Steven not with you? <br>
SARA: No. I came back that way. <br>
DOCTOR: Hurry, my child, hurry!

he is alone.) <br>
STEVEN: Sara! Sara! <br>
(Not far behind, the Doctor and Sara emerge from the Dalek base.) <br>
SARA: Hurry, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: My dear, are you beginning to feel strange? <br>
SARA: The wind. Listen, can't you hear it? I've never heard that on
Kembel before. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, perhaps it's this time destructor having an effect
on the elements. <br>
SARA: Then destroy it! <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, that's impossible, my dear. There's one thing I do know
about this machine. It will continue until the taranium has finally
burnt itself out. Our only chance is to get back to the Tardis. Then I
can neutralise it. <br>
SARA: Hurry.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven reaches the safety of the Tardis and
stumbles inside. Still clutching the time destructor, the Doctor leads
the way back through the jungle but realises that Sara has fallen
behind.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not far now. Sara! <br>
(Sara is aging before his eyes.) <br>
SARA: Keep going! The Daleks must be after us by now! <br>
DOCTOR: The time destructor is <br>

SARA: You think I don't know? <br>
(The Dalek patrol leaves the underground base and sets off in pursuit
of the Doctor. Ahead, the Doctor does his best to help the increasingly
infirm Sara struggle onwards, despite the ever-worsening environment. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Meanwhile, Steven is pacing impatiently up and
down. Not sure what else to do, he turns on the scanner.) <br>
STEVEN: Nothing. <br>
(Feeling helpless, Steven takes out his frustration on the Tardis
console.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Daleks maintain their dogged pursuit. All
around them the jungle is changing, plants withering and dying, lush
foliage shrivelling up and turning to dust. Apparently unmoved and
unaffected by the vast power of the time destructor, the Daleks
continue to close in on their quarry. Yet the effects are taking a
heavy toll on both Sara and the Doctor. Frail and weak, the old man
stumbles onwards, all too aware that time is quite literally running
out for his companion. At last they see the Tardis ahead but the Doctor
can barely stagger a few more steps before he falls to his knees unable
to go on. With a final desperate effort, Sara helps the Doctor up and
they stumble a few short paces further before the Doctor falls again.
The time destructor slips from his fingers, rolling away to lie just
inches from his hand. Beside him, Sara pitches forward in the dust,
unable to remain upright. She barely has the strength to open her eyes
but somehow finds the will. She attempts to claw her way over to the
time destructor.) <br>
SARA: Doctor. <br>
(The last of her strength gone, Sara falls and lies still.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven's delight at seeing his friends appear on
the scanner turns to shock as they sprawl in the sand.)&nbsp;<br>
STEVEN: Doctor! Sara!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Steven rushes outside. The Tardis now stands in
harsh desert, buffeted by gale force winds and flying detritus. He
looks around for his companions. Finally an indistinct shape catches
his attention.) <br>
STEVEN: Dust! It's all crumbling into dust. <br>
(Steven stumbles over to where Sara lies, unmoving. Before he can reach
her a gust of wind seems to lift her up. He watches in horror as her
skin and hair fade away, her bones dispersing as dust on the wind.) <br>
STEVEN: Sara! <br>
(Steven staggers over towards the Doctor. As he does so, he feels the
effects of the time destructor working on him too. There is very little
time left. The time destructor lies half buried in the dust. Steven
falls to his knees and attempts to smash it. Then he flicks a switch on
the side of the device. When nothing seems to happen, Steven abandons
it and makes once more for the Doctor, who appears to have rejuvenated
slightly and is again making an effort to get himself back to the
Tardis.) <br>
STEVEN: Come on, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, don't touch me. <br>
STEVEN: I must help you. <br>
DOCTOR: You must get back to the ship! Go forward. <br>
(Steven grabs the Doctor and with a supreme effort manages to help him
to his feet. Together they stumble through the screaming winds towards
the ship. With every step they feel their youth and strength returning,
and finally they reach the sanctuary of the Tardis.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Close the door. Thank you, my friend.
Thank you, Steven. By chance, you reversed the time destructor. Instead
of time rushing forward, it's now racing back. Sara? You realise she
came to look for me, to see if I was all right? <br>
STEVEN: I was forcing my way through the jungle. I didn't even see her
go. <br>
DOCTOR: The Daleks! <br>
(The Doctor and Steven watch as the Dalek patrol appears on the
scanner. Approaching the Tardis, the Daleks are moving much more slowly
than normal.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In an attempt to destroy the weapon they fought so
hard to acquire, one of the Daleks fires at it. The time destructor is
unharmed by the blast. Hurricane force winds spin the Daleks around and
out of control. As time continues to race backwards, the Daleks start
to decay. Their metal casings split and melt away, briefly revealing
the clawed mutants inside. Helpless, the creatures scream, reduce to
embryonic state then turn to dust. The ground shudders and heaves.) <br>
(After a time, the Doctor and Steven emerge from the Tardis. The
landscape of Kembel has been devastated and reshaped beyond all
recognition.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dust. Nothing but dust! <br>
(Steven finds a chunk of twisted rusting metal lying on the ground.) <br>
STEVEN: The time destructor, what's left of it. <br>
DOCTOR: Mavic Chen's taranium core has finally burnt itself out. <br>
STEVEN: I wish Sara could have seen the end. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, my boy, so do I. You know, Steven, the one thing that Sara
lived for was to see the total destruction of the Daleks. Well, now
it's all over. Without her help, this could never have been achieved. <br>
(The Doctor notices something in the sand and reaches down to scoop it
up in his hand.) <br>
STEVEN: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Millions of years of progress reversed back. <br>
(The Doctor opens his hand to show Steven a tiny dead embryo.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's all that remains of a Dalek. <br>
STEVEN: Let's go, Doctor. I've seen enough of this place. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my boy, we finally rid this planet of Daleks. <br>
STEVEN: Bret, Katarina, Sara. <br>
DOCTOR: What a waste. What a terrible waste. <br>
(They go into the Tardis and it dematerialises.)
