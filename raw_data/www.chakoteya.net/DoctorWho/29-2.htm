<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Evening. A young man playing a lute and serenading
a woman who is leaning out of an upstairs
window. Very Romeo and Juliet.) <br>
WIGGINS: (sings) Her face was like a winter's moon that lights the
traveller's way. Her smile was like a summer bloom that bursts then
fades away. My love is night, my love is day. My love she is my world. <br>
LILITH: Such sweet music shows your blood to be afire. Why wait we on
stale custom for consummation? <br>
WIGGINS: Oh, yes. Tonight's the night. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lilith's house]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LILITH: Would you enter, bold sir? <br>
WIGGINS: Oh, I would. <br>
(The room has an assortment of herbs and things hanging from
appropriate places.) <br>
WIGGINS: Lilith, this cannot be the home of one so beautiful. Forgive
me, this is foul. <br>
LILITH: Shush. Sad words suit not upon a lover's tongue. <br>
(She kisses him. Her face turns changes to one with a hooked nose and
deep lines, and pointed teeth, and her voice is higher pitched. Very
Scottish Play.) <br>
LILITH: Oh, your kiss transformed me. A suitor should meet his
beloved's parents. Mother Doomfinger? <br>
(A sour-faced old woman stands up behind Wiggins.) <br>
LILITH: And Mother Bloodtide. <br>
(Another woman jumps down from a rafter, cackling. They all pounce upon
Wiggins. There are some nasty squishy sounds, then Lilith speaks
directly to us.) <br>
LILITH: Soon, at the hour of woven words, we shall rise again, and this
fleeting Earth will perish!
Bwahahahahahaha!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis is still bucking, and Martha is hanging
on to the console.) <br>
MARTHA: But how do you travel in time? What makes it go? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, let's take the fun and mystery out of everything. Martha,
you don't want to know. It just does. Hold on tight. <br>
(The Tardis comes to a halt, and Martha falls to the floor.) <br>
MARTHA: Blimey. Do you have to pass a test to fly this thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and I failed it. Now, make the most of it. I promised you
one trip, and one trip only. Outside this door, brave new world. <br>
(The Tempest.) <br>
MARTHA: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Take a look. After you. </font></p>

eaves, scruffy urchins running
around.)&nbsp;<br>
MARTHA: Oh, you are kidding me. You are so kidding me. Oh, my God, we
did it. We travelled in time. Where are we? No, sorry. I got to get
used to this whole new language. When are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Mind out. <br>
(He pulls Martha back as a man empties his slop bucket from an upstairs
window.) <br>
MAN: Gardez l'eau! <br>
DOCTOR: Somewhere before the invention of the toilet. Sorry about that.
<br>
MARTHA: I've seen worse. I've worked the late night shift A+E. But are
we safe? I mean, can we move around and stuff? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course we can. Why do you ask? <br>
MARTHA: It's like in the films. You step on a butterfly, you change the
future of the human race. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell you what then, don't step on any butterflies. What have
butterflies ever done to you? <br>
MARTHA: What if, I don't know, what if I kill my grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: Are you planning to? <br>
MARTHA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, then. <br>
MARTHA: And this is London? <br>
DOCTOR: I think so. Round about 1599. <br>
MARTHA: Oh, but hold on. Am I all right? I'm not going to get carted
off as a slave, am I? <br>
DOCTOR: Why would they do that? <br>
MARTHA: Not exactly white, in case you haven't noticed. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not even human. Just walk about like you own the place.
Works for me. Besides, you'd be surprised. Elizabethan England, not so
different from your time. Look over there. They've got recycling. <br>
(A man shovels horse manure into a bucket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Water cooler moment. <br>
(Two men talking at a water barrel.) <br>
PREACHER: And the world will be consumed by flame. <br>
DOCTOR: Global warming. Oh, yes, and entertainment. Popular
entertainment for the masses. If I'm right, we're just down the river
by Southwark, right next to <br>
(The Doctor gets Martha to run along from the south end of old London
Bridge, past St Mary Ovarie - Southwark Cathedral - to a view of)<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, the Globe Theatre! Brand new. Just opened. Through,
strictly speaking, it's not a globe, it's a tetradecagon. Fourteen
sides. Containing the man himself. <br>
MARTHA: Whoa, you don't mean. Is Shakespeare in there? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Miss Jones, will you accompany me to the theatre? <br>
MARTHA: Mister Smith, I will. <br>
DOCTOR: When you get home, you can tell everyone you've seen
Shakespeare. <br>
MARTHA: Then I could get sectioned.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A performance has just finished, and the packed
audience of about three thousand are applauding the actors. The Doctor
and Martha have been watching with the rest of the ordinary folk in the
pit.) <br>
MARTHA: That's amazing! Just amazing. It's worth putting up with the
smell. And those are men dressed as women, yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: London never changes. <br>
MARTHA: Where's Shakespeare? I want to see Shakespeare. Author! Author!
Do people shout that? Do they shout Author? <br>
MAN: Author! Author! <br>
(And the crowd take up the chant.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they do now. <br>
(Shakespeare comes onto the stage, very full of himself, to rapturous
applause.) <br>
MARTHA: He's a bit different from his portraits. <br>
(Lilith is dressed like an aristocrat, and sitting alone in one of the
upper boxes. She takes a rough doll with a strand of hair stuck to its
head from her purse.) <br>
DOCTOR: Genius. He's a genius. The genius. The most human human there's
ever been. Now we're
going to hear him speak. Always he chooses the best words. New,
beautiful, brilliant words. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Ah, shut your big fat mouths! <br>
(Laughter.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well. <br>
MARTHA: You should never meet your heroes. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: You've got excellent taste, I'll give you that. Oh, that's
a wig. <br>
(Lilith pulls the hair on her doll.) <br>
LILITH: Wind the craft of ancient harm. The time approaches for our
charm. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: I know what you're all saying. Loves Labour's Lost, that's
a funny ending, isn't it? It just stops. Will the boys get the girls?
Well, don't get your hose in a tangle, you'll find out soon. Yeah,
yeah. All in good time. You don't rush a genius. <br>
(Lilith kisses her doll and Shakespeare suddenly goes rigid and blank.)
<br>
SHAKESPEARE: When? Tomorrow night. The premiere of my brand new play. A
sequel, no less, and I call it Loves Labour's Won. <br>
(A short while later, everyone is filing out of the theatre.) <br>
MARTHA: I'm not an expert, but I've never heard of Loves Labour's Won. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. The lost play. It doesn't exist, only in rumours. It's
mentioned in lists of his plays but never ever turns up. And no one
knows why. <br>
MARTHA: Have you got a mini-disc or something? We can tape it. We can
flog it. Sell it when we get home and make a mint. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
MARTHA: That would be bad. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. <br>
MARTHA: Well, how come it disappeared in the first place? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I was just going to give you a quick little trip in the
Tardis, but I suppose we could stay a bit longer. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(At The Elephant, a courtyard tavern like the
George over on Borough High
Street, a serving girl brings in a tray to Shakespeare and his two
companions.) <br>
DOLLY: Here you go, Will. Drink up. There's enough beer in this
lodgings house to sink the Spanish. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Dolly Bailey, you've saved my life. <br>
DOLLY: I'll do more than that later tonight. And you, girl, hurry up
with your tasks. The talk of gentlemen is best not overheard. <br>
LILITH: Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am. <br>
(Lilith is in plain dark dress and a white cap.) <br>
BURBAGE: You must be mad, Will. Loves Labour's Won? I mean, we're not
ready. It's supposed to be next week. What made you say that? <br>
KEMPE: You haven't even finished it yet. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: I've just got the final scene to go. You'll get it by
morning. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello! Excuse me, not interrupting, am I? Mister Shakespeare,
isn't it? <br>
SHAKESPEARE:: Oh, no. No, no, no. Who let you in? No autographs. No,
you can't have yourself sketched with me. And please don't ask where I
get my ideas from. Thanks for the interest. Now be a good boy and shove
<br>
(Shakespeare spots Martha.) <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Hey, nonny nonny. Sit right down here next to me. You two
get sewing on them costumes. Off you go. <br>
DOLLY: Come on, lads. I think our William's found his new muse. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Sweet lady. <br>
(Dolly, Burbage and Kempe leave. Martha and the Doctor sit at the
table.) <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Such unusual clothes. So fitted. <br>
MARTHA: Er, verily, forsooth, egads. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, don't do that. Don't. <br>
(The Doctor shows Shakespeare his psychic paper.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm Sir Doctor of Tardis and this is my companion, Miss Martha
Jones. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Interesting, that bit of paper. It's blank. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's very clever. That proves it. Absolute genius. <br>
MARTHA: No, it says so right there. Sir Doctor, Martha Jones. It says
so. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: And I say it's blank. <br>
DOCTOR: Psychic paper. Er, long story. Oh, I hate starting from
scratch. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Psychic? Never heard that before and words are my trade.
Who are you exactly? More's the point, who is your delicious blackamoor
lady? <br>
MARTHA: What did you say? <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Oops. Isn't that a word we use nowadays? An Ethiop girl? A
swarth? A Queen of Afric? <br>
MARTHA: I can't believe I'm hearing this. <br>
DOCTOR: It's political correctness gone mad. Er, Martha's from a
far-off land. Freedonia. <br>
(A man in expensive clothes and wearing a gold chain of office enters.
He is the
official censor, from the Lord Chamberlain's office.) <br>
LYNLEY: Excuse me! Hold hard a moment. This is abominable behaviour. A
new play with no warning? I demand to see a script, Mister Shakespeare.
As Master of the Revels, every new script must be registered at my
office and examined by me before it can be performed. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Tomorrow morning, first thing, I'll send it round. <br>
LYNLEY: I don't work to your schedule, you work to mine. The script,
now! <br>
SHAKESPEARE: I can't. <br>
LYNLEY: Then tomorrow's performance is cancelled. <br>
(Lilith leaves quietly.) <br>
MARTHA: It's all go around here, isn't it? <br>
LYNLEY: I'm returning to my office for a banning order. If it's the
last thing I do, Love's Labours Won will never be played. <br>

out to investigate.) <br>

hear me? You're
going to be all right. <br>
(Martha starts to clear Lynley's airways for CPR, and water gushes
out.) <br>
MARTHA: What the hell is that? <br>
DOCTOR: I've never seen a death like it. His lungs are full of water.
He drowned and then, I
don't know, like a blow to the heart, an invisible blow. <br>
(Lilith watches from a balcony.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good mistress, this poor fellow has died from a sudden
imbalance of the humours. A natural if unfortunate demise. Call a
constable and have him taken away. <br>
DOLLY: Yes, sir. <br>
LILITH: I'll do it, ma'am. <br>

MARTHA: And why are you telling them that? <br>

them the truth, they'll panic and think it was witchcraft. <br>

the landing. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Poor Lynley. So many strange events. Not least of all,
this land of Freedonia where a woman can be a doctor? <br>
MARTHA: Where a woman can do what she likes. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: And you, Sir Doctor. How can a man so young have eyes so
old? <br>
DOCTOR: I do a lot of reading. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: A trite reply. Yeah, that's what I'd do. And you? You look
at him like you're surprised he exists. He's as much of a puzzle to you
as he is to me. <br>
MARTHA: I think we should say goodnight. <br>

SHAKESPEARE: I must work. I have a play to complete. But I'll get my
answers tomorrow, Doctor, and I'll discover more about you and why this
constant performance of yours. <br>

DOCTOR: We'll manage. Come on. <br>
MARTHA: So, magic and stuff. That's a surprise. It's all a little bit
Harry Potter. <br>
DOCTOR: Wait till you read book seven. (published 2007) Oh, I cried. <br>
MARTHA: But is it real, though? I mean, witches, black magic and all
that, it's real? <br>
DOCTOR: Course it isn't! <br>
MARTHA: Well, how am I supposed to know? I've only just started
believing in time travel. Give me a break. <br>
DOCTOR: Looks like witchcraft, but it isn't. Can't be. Are you going to
stand there all night? <br>
MARTHA: Budge up a bit, then. Sorry, there's not much room. Us two
here, same bed. Tongues will wag. <br>
DOCTOR: There's such a thing as psychic energy, but a human couldn't
channel it like that. Not without a generator the size of Taunton and I
think we'd have spotted that. No, there's something I'm missing,
Martha. Something really close, staring me right in the face and I
can't see it. Rose'd know. A friend of mine, Rose. Right now, she'd say
exactly the right thing. Still, can't be helped. You're a novice, never
mind. I'll take you back home tomorrow. <br>

window. Lilith glides up outside, uncorks the bottle of potion and
blows the green vapours towards him. With a susurration of voices,
Shakespeare breathes it in and collapses onto his papers. Lilith enters
and holds up her doll, now equipped with strings to make it a puppet
holding a quill in its hand.) <br>
LILITH: Bind the mind and take the man. Speed the words to writer's
hand. <br>
(She tugs a string and Shakespeare jerks upright again, then writes
without looking at the paper as she jiggles the puppet's arm. Across
the way, the Doctor is still awake while Martha sleeps. Finally
Shakespeare writes finis, and slumps again. Lilith strokes his head.) <br>
DOLLY [OC]: Will? <br>
(Dolly enters with a broom.) <br>
DOLLY: Finished cleaning just in time for your special treat. Oh, aye.
I'm not the first, then. <br>

LILITH: I'll take that to aid my flight and you shall speak no more
this night. <br>

leap out of bed and run to the room. Shakespeare wakes up.) <br>
SHAKESPEARE: What? What was that? <br>

witch on a broomstick silhouetted against the full moon. Lilith
cackles.) <br>

MARTHA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What did you see? <br>
MARTHA: A witch. <br>
(Later, a cockerel crows and dogs start barking at the rising sun.) <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Oh, sweet Dolly Bailey. She sat out three bouts of the
plague in this place when we all ran like rats. But what could have
scared her so? She had such enormous spirit. <br>
DOCTOR: Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
(Dylan Thomas.) <br>
SHAKESPEARE: I might use that. <br>
DOCTOR: You can't. It's someone else's. <br>
MARTHA: But the thing is, Lynley drowned on dry land, Dolly died of
fright, and they were both connected to you. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: You're accusing me? <br>
MARTHA: No, but I saw a witch, big as you like, flying, cackling away,
and you've written about witches. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: I have? When was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Not, not quite yet. <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Peter Streete spoke of witches. <br>
MARTHA: Who's Peter Streete? <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Our builder. He sketched the plans to the Globe. <br>

sides? <br>

Said it carried the sound well. <br>
DOCTOR: Fourteen. Why does that ring a bell? Fourteen. <br>
MARTHA: There's fourteen lines in a sonnet. <br>
DOCTOR: So there is. Good point. Words and shapes following the same
design. Fourteen lines, fourteen sides, fourteen facets. Oh, my head.
Tetradecagon. Think, think, think! Words, letters, numbers, lines! <br>
SHAKESPEARE: This is just a theatre. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, but a theatre's magic, isn't it? You should know.
Stand on this stage, say the right words with the right emphasis a the
right time. Oh, you can make men weep, or cry with joy. Change them.
You can change people's minds just with words in this place. But if you
exaggerate that. <br>
MARTHA: It's like your police box. Small wooden box with all that power
inside. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, Martha Jones, I like you. Tell you what, though. Peter
Streete would know. Can I talk to him? <br>
SHAKESPEARE: You won't get an answer. A month after finishing this
place, lost his mind. <br>
MARTHA: Why? What happened? <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Started raving about witches, hearing voices, babbling.
His mind was addled. <br>
DOCTOR: Where is he now? <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Bedlam. <br>
MARTHA: What's Bedlam? <br>
SHAKESPEARE: Bethlem Hospital. The madhouse. <br>
