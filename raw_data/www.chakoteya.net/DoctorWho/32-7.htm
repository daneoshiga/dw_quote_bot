and cared for and protected. But this isn't a time for lies. What you
are going to be, Melody is very, very brave. <br>

RIVER: It's my birthday. The Doctor took me ice skating on the River
Thames in 1814, the last of the great Frost Fairs. He got Stevie Wonder
to sing for me under London Bridge. <br>
RORY: Stevie Wonder sang in 1814? <br>
RIVER: Yes, he did. But you must never tell him. <br>

a drawer and finds what might be an electric toothbrush.) <br>
AMY: Who's that? Who's there? You watch it, because I'm armed and
really dangerous, and cross. <br>
RORY [OC]: Yeah, like I don't know that. <br>
AMY: Rory? Rory, is that you. <br>
RORY [OC]: Yeah, it's me. Look, hang on a minute. <br>
(It sounds like Rory is trying to sonic his way in.) <br>
AMY: They took her. Rory, they took our baby away. <br>
(The door opens. Rory is carrying Melody.) <br>
RORY: Now, Mrs Williams, that is never, ever going to happen. <br>
AMY: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where's she been? What have they done to
her? <br>
RORY: She's fine. Amy, she's fine. I checked. She's beautiful. Oh God,
I was going to be cool. I wanted to be cool. Look at me. <br>
AMY: You're okay. Crying Roman with a baby. Definitely cool. Come here,
you. <br>
DOCTOR: Urgh. Kissing and crying. I'll, I'll be back in a bit. <br>
RORY: Oi, you. Get in here, now. My daughter. What do you think? <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. Hello, baby. <br>
AMY: Melody. <br>
DOCTOR: Melody? Hello, Melody Pond. <br>
RORY: Melody Williams. <br>
AMY: Is a geography teacher. Melody Pond is a superhero. <br>
DOCTOR: Well yes, I suppose she does smell nice. Never really sniffed
her. Maybe I should give it a go. Amelia Pond, come here. <br>
AMY: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry we were so long. <br>
AMY: It's okay. I knew you were coming. Both of you. My boys. <br>
DOCTOR: It's okay. She's still all yours. And really, you should call
her mummy, not big milk thing. <br>
AMY: Okay, what are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: I speak Baby. <br>
AMY: No, you don't. <br>
DOCTOR: I speak everything, don't I, Melody Pond. No, it's not. it's
cool. <br>
VASTRA: Doctor? Take a look. They're leaving. Demon's Run is ours
without a drop of blood spilled. My friend, you have never risen
higher.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Amy carried Melody out of the Tardis.) <br>
RORY: Hey, what's wrong? <br>
AMY: She doesn't like the Tardis noise. I asked him to turn something
off, but it was all, but I don't want to punch a hole in the space-time
continuum. Shush. <br>
JENNY: Rory! The Judoon have escorted the Clerics out of the quadrant.
Spitfires have returned to their own time. Captain Avery and his men
are going. Is she all right? <br>
AMY: Yes, she's just crying. <br>
STRAX: Give her to me, human fool. She needs changing. <br>
AMY: I just changed her. I think she might need a feed. <br>
STRAX: A feed, of course. I'll take care of everything. <br>
RORY: Er, I really don't think you will, actually. <br>
STRAX: I have gene-spliced myself for all nursing duties. I can produce
magnificent quantities of lactic fluid. <br>
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis with a wooden cot that has an
orrary dangling over it.) <br>
DOCTOR: She's not hungry, she's tired. Sorry, Melody, they're just not
listening. <br>
AMY: What's this? <br>
DOCTOR: Very pretty, according to your daughter. <br>
RORY: It's a, it's a cot. <br>
DOCTOR: No flies on the Roman. Give her here. <br>
AMY: Hey, there we go. <br>
RORY: But where would you get a cot? <br>
AMY: It's old. Really old. Doctor, er, do you have children? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
AMY: Have you ever had children? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's real. It's my hair. <br>
AMY: Who slept in here? <br>
VASTRA [OC]: Doctor, we need you in the main control room. <br>
DOCTOR: Be right there! Things to do. I've still got to work out what
this base is for. We can't leave till we know. <br>
AMY: But this is where I was? The whole time I thought I was on the
Tardis, I was really here? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, Centurian, permission to hug? <br>
RORY: Be aware, I do have a sword. <br>
DOCTOR: At all times. You were on the Tardis, too. Your heart, your
mind, your soul. But physically, yes, you were still in this place. <br>
AMY: And when I saw that face looking through the hatch, that woman
looking at me. <br>
DOCTOR: Reality bleeding through. They must have taken you quite a
while back. Just before America. <br>
RORY: That's probably enough hugging now. So her Flesh avatar was with
us all that time. But that means they were projecting a control signal
right into the Tardis wherever we were in time and space. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, they're very clever. <br>
AMY: Who are? <br>
RORY: Whoever wants our baby. <br>
AMY: But why do they want her? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
RORY: Is there anything you're not telling us? You knew Amy wasn't
real. You never said. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I couldn't be sure they weren't listening. <br>
AMY: But you always hold out on us. Please, not this time. Doctor, it's
our baby. Tell us something. One little thing. <br>
DOCTOR: It's mine. <br>
RORY: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: The cot. It's my cot. I slept in there. <br>
AMY: Oh, my God. It's the Doctor's first stars. <br>
RORY: She's <br>

DORIUM: I believe I sold it to them. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo. So what have we learned? <br>
VASTRA: That anger is always the shortest distance to a mistake. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry? <br>
VASTRA: The words of an old friend who once found me in the London
Underground, attempting to avenge my sisters on perfectly innocent
tunnel diggers. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you were very cross at the time. <br>
VASTRA: As you were today, old friend. Point taken, I hope. Now, I have
a question. A simple one. Is Melody human? <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, what? Of course she is. Completely human. What are you
talking about? <br>
DORIUM: They've been scanning her since she was born, and I think they
found what they were looking for. <br>
DOCTOR: Human DNA. <br>
VASTRA: Look closer. Human plus. Specifically, human plus Time Lord.

would I lie to you? <br>
RORY: Well, you might want to take a look at your uniform. <br>
LORNA: The only reason I joined the Clerics was so I could meet the
Doctor again. <br>
JENNY: You wanted to meet him, so you joined an army to fight him? <br>
LORNA: Well, how else do you meet a great warrior? <br>
AMY: He's not a warrior. <br>
LORNA: Then why is he called the Doctor? <br>
(The lights go out.) <br>
LORNA: It's starting. Please, listen to me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: But she's human. She's Amy and Rory's
daughter. <br>
VASTRA: You've told me about your people. They became what they did
through prolonged exposure to the time vortex. The Untempered Schism. <br>
DOCTOR: Over billions of years. It didn't just happen. <br>
VASTRA: So how close is she? Could she even regenerate? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. I don't think so. <br>
VASTRA: You don't sound so sure. <br>
DOCTOR: Because I don't understand how this happened. <br>
VASTRA: Which leads me to ask when did it happen? <br>
DOCTOR: When? <br>
VASTRA: I am trying to be delicate. I know how you can blush. When did
this baby begin? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you mean <br>
VASTRA: Quite. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, how would I know? That's all human-y, private stuff. It
just sort of goes on. They don't put up a balloon, or anything. <br>
VASTRA: But could the child have begun on the Tardis in flight, in the
vortex. <br>
DOCTOR: No! No! Impossible! It's all running about, sexy fish vampires
and blowing up stuff. And Rory wasn't even there at the beginning. Then
he was dead, then he didn't exist, then he was plastic. Then I had to
reboot the whole universe. Long story. So, technically the first time
they were on the Tardis together in this version of reality, was on
their w <br>
VASTRA: On their what? <br>
DOCTOR: On their wedding night.

yourself a Time Lord. <br>

they've been working very hard ever since. <br>
DORIUM: And yet they gave in so easily. Does this not that bother
anyone else? <br>
DOCTOR: Amy. She worried the baby would have a time head. She said that

VASTRA: Only you would ignore the instincts of a mother. <br>
DORIUM: Or the instincts of a coward. This is too easy. There's
something wrong. <br>

DOCTOR: Why would a Time Lord be a weapon? <br>

back to the others. <br>

DOCTOR: Me? <br>
(The Doctor thinks back to the warehouse in 1969.) <br>
RIVER [memory]: I'd say she's human, going by the life-support
software. She climbed out of the suit, like she forced her way out. She
must be incredibly strong. <br>
KOVARIAN [on screen]: I see you accessed our files. Do you understand
yet? Oh, don't worry, I'm a long way away. But I like to keep tabs on
you. The child, then. What do you think? <br>

DOCTOR: You helped my friends. Thank you. <br>
LORNA: I met you once, in the Gamma Forests. You don't remember me. <br>
DOCTOR: Hey, of course I remember. I remember everyone. Hey, we ran,
you and me. Didn't we run, Lorna? <br>

DOCTOR: Who was she? <br>
VASTRA: I don't know, but she was very brave. <br>
DOCTOR: They're always brave. They're always brave. <br>
VASTRA: So, what now? They'd almost certainly have taken her to Earth.
Raise her in the correct environment. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, they did. And it's already too late. <br>
VASTRA: You're giving up? You never do that. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, and don't you sometimes wish I did? <br>

RIVER: Well then, soldier. How goes the day? <br>
DOCTOR: Where the hell have you been? Every time you've asked, I have
been there. Where the hell were you today? <br>
RIVER: I couldn't have prevented this. <br>
DOCTOR: You could have tried! <br>
RIVER: And so, my love, could you. I know you're not all right. But
hold tight, Amy, because you're going to be. <br>
DOCTOR: You think I wanted this? I didn't do this. This, this wasn't
me! <br>
RIVER: This was exactly you. All this. All of it. You make them so
afraid. When you began, all those years ago, sailing off to see the
universe, did you ever think you'd become this? The man who can turn an
army around at the mention of his name. Doctor. The word for healer and
wise man throughout the universe. We get that word from you, you know.
But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean?
To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word Doctor means mighty
warrior. How far you've come. And now they've taken a child, the child
of your best friends, and they're going to turn her into a weapon just
to bring you down. And all this, my love, in fear of you. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? <br>
RIVER: Oh look, your cot. Haven't seen that in a very long while. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, you tell me. Tell me who you are. <br>

DOCTOR: How do I look? <br>

DOCTOR: I'd better be. <br>

DOCTOR: Vastra and Jenny, till the next time. Rory and Amy, I know
where to find your daughter, and on my life, she will be safe. River,
get them all home. <br>
RORY: Doctor! <br>
AMY: No! Where are you going? <br>

inside.) <br>

AMY: Tell me what you told the Doctor. <br>
RORY: Amy, no. Stop it! <br>
RIVER: It's okay, Rory. She's fine. She's good. It's the Tardis
translation matrix. It takes a while to kick in with the written word.
You have to concentrate. <br>
AMY: I still can't read it. <br>
RIVER: It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate. But this
will. <br>

RIVER: It's your daughter's name in the language of the Forest. <br>
AMY: I know my daughter's name. <br>
RIVER: Except they don't have a word for Pond, because the only water
in the forest is the River. The Doctor will find your daughter, and he
will care for her whatever it takes. And I know that. It's me. I'm
Melody. I'm your daughter. </font> </p>
