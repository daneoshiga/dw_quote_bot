BRIGADIER: Yes. I'll plant it when we get home. <br>
DORIS: Oh, thank you. <br>
BRIGADIER: The exercise will do me good. Now, where's that salesman got

fires her pistol. The first knight and another then use their swords.

DOCTOR: Who signed it? <br>
ACE: The Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah well, that sorts that out. <br>
ACE: PS, Morgaine has just seized control of the nuclear missile. <br>
DOCTOR: Tut. I could have given myself more warning. Brigadier, you and
Ace see to this ship. <br>
BRIGADIER: Explosives, Doctor. <br>
ACE: Now you're talking. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll give Arthur a warrior's burial. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mordred lays Bambera's body on the ground by the
Mobile Command post, then Ancelyn charges in. The two rivals fight,
parting briefly as the Doctor walks between them and goes inside. <br>
The countdown passes 60.) <br>
MORGAINE: Too late, Merlin. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it? Not while there's an abort button. <br>
(Morgaine and the Doctor struggle.) <br>
DOCTOR: If this missile explodes, millions will die, you will die. <br>
MORGAINE: I shall die with honour. <br>
(45, 44) <br>
DOCTOR: All over the world, fools are poised ready to let death fly. <i>A
spark could turn into an inferno. <br>
MORGAINE: What do I care? This is war. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it? Death falling from the sky, blind, random, anywhere,
anytime. No one is safe, no one is innocent? </i> Machines of
death, Morgaine, are screaming from above, of light brighter than the
sun. Not a war between armies nor a war between nations, but just
death, death gone mad. The child looks up in the sky, his eyes turn to
cinders. No more tears, only ashes. Is this honour? Is this war? Are
these the weapons you would use? Tell me! <br>
MORGAINE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Then put a stop to it, Morgaine. End the madness. <br>
(4, 3, 2. Morgaine presses the red abort button at 1.) <br>
MORGAINE: Then tell Arthur to face me with honour in single combat. <i>Tell
him to show himself. It's time he ceased hiding behind your coat tails,
Merlin.</i> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The spacecraft explodes in the lake. Ace leaps up
and down.) <br>
ACE: And you said two kilos wouldn't be enough. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Arthur is dead. <br>
MORGAINE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: He's dead, Morgaine. <br>
MORGAINE: Merlin, prince of deceit. Another trick. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
MORGAINE: I don't believe you. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you? <br>
MORGAINE: It can't be. <br>
DOCTOR: He died over a thousand years ago. <br>
MORGAINE: Arthur, who burned like star fire. <br>
DOCTOR: Gone. <br>
MORGAINE: And was as beautiful. Where does he lie? I would look at him
one final time. <br>
DOCTOR: He's gone to dust. <br>
MORGAINE: Then I shall not even have that comfort. I shall never see
him again. Arthur. We were together in the woods of Celadon. The air
was like honey. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Morgaine. It's over. <br>
(The Doctor removes the key from the firing controls and puts it in his
breast pocket.) </font></p>

ANCELYN: I do not fear death, Mordred. You have slain my beloved. There
is no life without her. <br>
MORDRED: So be it. Tis time! <br>
(The Doctor stops Mordred swinging his sword. He forces him to his
knees and puts his fingers on Mordred's forehead.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time and Time Lords wait for no man. <br>
(Mordred falls unconscious. Bambera gets up, and so does Ancelyn.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Brigadier. Before Mordred recovers, lock him up. And while
you're at it, lock up his mother. </font></p>

ANCELYN: The silence after a battle, Doctor. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, I'm not being a very good host. Are you all right
out here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just admiring the garden. <br>
BRIGADIER: I don't suppose you've seen Doris, have you? <br>
DORIS: Bye! <br>
(The Brigadier goes to her.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think the battle may be about to begin. <br>
BRIGADIER: You going somewhere, dear? <br>
DORIS: Out. <br>
BRIGADIER: Out? <br>
DORIS: Out, with the girls. </font></p>

DOCTOR: I thought you said this was a piece of antiquated junk? <br>
ACE: Did I say that, Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SHOU: We'll try not to break too many speed records. <br>
BAMBERA: Or traffic laws. <br>
DORIS: Hey, what's that? <br>
ACE: Do you want to drive, Doris? <br>
DORIS: Oh, no. Er, I'll drive on the way back, okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Allow me. <br>
(The Doctor hands Doris into the passenger seat.) <br>
DORIS: Thank you, Doctor. Whee! <br>
BRIGADIER: Er, exactly how far are you intending to go, Doris? <br>
DORIS: Well, I don't know, but there's lots of work to be done in the
garden. Roll the grass. <br>
BRIGADIER: What about supper? <br>
DORIS: Oh, that's a good idea. Have something really delicious ready
for us when we get home, okay? <br>
(Ace drives Bessie away with a honk of the horn.) <br>
DORIS: Oh, wicked! <br>
ANCELYN: Ah, are they not magnificent? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yeah. Are you any good with a lawn mower, Ancelyn? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll cook supper. </font> </p>
