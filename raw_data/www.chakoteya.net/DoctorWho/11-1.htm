<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (As a spaceship streaks through the inky black
void, an axe smashes into a table in the great hall. Two men wearing
heavy fur cloaks are seated.) <br>
IRONGRON: This sheep has been dead a year. Are they trying to poison
me? <br>
BLOODAXE: It is salted. <br>
IRONGRON: Salted? It stinks! Wine! Must I perish of thirst? Bring me
wine! <br>
(A serving woman pours from a pitcher into his tankard.) <br>
MEG: 'Tis the dregs of the barrel, Captain. 'Tis the last there is. <br>
(Irongron tries it and spits it out.) <br>
IRONGRON: Sour wine! Stinking meat! Sour wine. Is this how I am served?
<br>
BLOODAXE: Our supplies are low, Captain. It's some time since we went
a-foraging.&nbsp;<br>
IRONGRON: And meanwhile our fine neighbours feast their bellies full on
fresh meat and swill down flagons of fine wine. <br>
BLOODAXE: Well, Sir Edward's storehouses and cellars are well stocked. <br>
IRONGRON: Then perhaps we should relieve him of some of his abundance,
eh, my friend? He's a good neighbour. He'll not miss a little of his
plenty. <br>
BLOODAXE: Look! <br>
(Out of the window a bright light descends straight to Earth.) <br>
BLOODAXE: Stars are falling! <br>
IRONGRON: I see only one star. <br>
(There is a pulsing glow in the distance.) <br>
IRONGRON: It has fallen in the forest! Come on, get up, you curs. Get
up! Get up! <br>
(The men stir from where they were sleeping on the floor.) <br>
BLOODAXE: 'Tis an omen. An evil sign. <br>
IRONGRON: It is mine. Irongron's star. I will have it! Hurry, fetch the
horses. <br>
BLOODAXE: Hurry? Hurry where? <br>
IRONGRON: To find the star before some knave robs me of it. It landed
close by! <br>
BLOODAXE: But the forest is still in darkness! Who knows what demons
may set upon us? <br>
IRONGRON: Why, you chicken-hearted knaves, every man of you! <br>
(Irongron raises his battleaxe at his men, and Bloodaxe restrains him.)
<br>
BLOODAXE: It's but an hour till dawn. Let's wait till then. To wait and
see what faces us. We'll follow you then, Captain. <br>
IRONGRON: Let all be made ready. I ride at dawn. Alone if need be. <br>
BLOODAXE: We're with you, Captain. <br>
IRONGRON: Then bring me some wine. We'll drink a toast to Irongron's
Star.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (At daybreak the frisky horses carry Irongron and
his men to a clearing where a large metal sphere sits.) <br>
IRONGRON: A star. A fallen star! <br>
BLOODAXE: Careful, Captain. Looks like the devil's work to me. <br>
(A door in the sphere and a squat biped in silver spacesuit and large
helmet with two eye slits comes out. It holds a long rod in one hand.) <br>
IRONGRON: A warrior. A warrior from the stars! Have you come to
challenge me, sky warrior? <br>
(Irongron draws his sword and approaches. The spaceman raises a ray gun
in its other hand, fires, and Irongron's sword vanishes.) <br>
BLOODAXE: Flee for your life, Captain! <br>
IRONGRON: What creature is this? <br>
BLOODAXE: 'Tis a devil from hell. <br>
(It adjusts a device on a belt round its 'waist'.) <br>
LINX: Peace. Fear not. I shall not harm you. <br>
IRONGRON: It speaks. Who are you? Where do you come from? <br>
LINX: I am a Sontaran officer. My name is Linx. <br>
BLOODAXE: I say he's a Saracen. I have heard tales of his Eastern
magic. <br>
(Linx plants his rod in the ground. A pair of flags pop out of the top.
He salutes it.) <br>
LINX: By virtue of my authority as an officer of the Army Space Corps,
I hereby claim this planet, its moons and satellites, for the greater
glory of the Sontaran Empire.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Linx is being held at sword point.) <br>
IRONGRON: Help you? Why should I help you, star warrior? Why should I
not kill you and take your ship and its treasure for myself? <br>
LINX: The ship is in need of repair. Even if it were not, you would
destroy yourself should you tamper with it. <br>
IRONGRON: Then why should I not just slay your for sport? Can you
overcome all of us with your magic? <br>
LINX: You are a soldier, are you not? A warrior? <br>
IRONGRON: I took this castle by force of arms. Those that were here
before me I slew. All the countryside around here pays my tribute. <br>
LINX: Yet no doubt you have enemies. Other warriors who envy your good
fortune. <br>
IRONGRON: Aye, but they cannot harm me. The King has levied tribute.
All their troops are at the wars. <br>
LINX: And when they return? <br>
IRONGRON: Then we shall fight. <br>
LINX: I can give you weapons. Weapons that can make you master, so that
none dare stand against you. You shall take what castles you will. <br>
IRONGRON: Magic weapons? Like that, that smote the sword from my hand? <br>
LINX: Other weapons fitter for your purpose. Weapons that can strike a
man dead from far away. You can be supreme warrior. <br>
IRONGRON: I can be king. But what do you ask in return, apart from your
life? <br>
LINX: Shelter. A place to conceal my ship and help with its repair. You
have men that can work in metal? <br>
IRONGRON: An armourer to sharpen weapons, a smith with a forge if these
will serve your need. <br>
LINX: I need more, much more. There is damage to the drive mechanism of
my ship. I need alloy, skilled technicians, complex circuitry. <br>
IRONGRON: Oh, we have none of these things of which you speak. <br>
LINX: Then I must take them from those who have.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A mattress is being rolled out on a metal bed
frame. There is a table and chair and another bed already made.) <br>
DOCTOR: In here, Brigadier? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm afraid so, Doctor. Not exactly The Ritz, I know,
but you know it's no joke providing emergency accommodation for all
these scientists. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, Brigadier, you've had your little bit of
mystification. Now I know where I'm supposed to stay, perhaps you we
don't mind telling me why? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, this place is one of the most top secret security
establishments in the whole country. In fact, most of their work's so
secret they don't even know what they're doing themselves. <br>
DOCTOR: And? <br>
BRIGADIER: It's also one of the best guarded places in the country.
Security details, alarm systems. <br>
DOCTOR: I rather gathered that when we arrived. For a moment I thought
they weren't going to let you in. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, exactly. Place is almost too security conscious. That's
what makes it all the more puzzling. <br>
DOCTOR: Makes what all the more puzzling? Come on, Brigadier, you can
tell me. <br>
BRIGADIER: People vanishing. <br>
DOCTOR: People? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, they've lost half a dozen leading scientists and
several million pounds worth of ultra-secret equipment. <br>
DOCTOR: What are they working on here, anyway? <br>
BRIGADIER: Space hardware. New alloys, guidance systems, methods of
propulsion. <br>
DOCTOR: And what action have you taken so far? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, I'd rather a bright idea. It's rather hard to keep an
eye on all these scientist chaps at home, so I had these cubicles put
up on several floors. Confined the whole lot to barracks. All my eggs
in one basket, so to speak. <br>
DOCTOR: That's fine, so long as no one steals the basket.

men in somewhat grubby but formerly white lab coats. It is part of the
castle, with flagstone floor. Linx's spaceship has been brought in. A
blacksmith brings anachronistic flintlock rifles for Linx to inspect.
Someone hammers on the heavy oak door.) <br>
BLOODAXE [OC]: Linx? My Lord Linx? Will you open the door? <br>
LINX: None may enter here. Such was my agreement with your captain. <br>
BLOODAXE [OC]: Yea, it is my Captain who sends me. He would have words
with you, Lord Linx. <br>
LINX: Then tell him I am occupied. Now leave me to my work! Insolent
primitives. Did I not need their aid </font></p>

IRONGRON: Where is the star warrior? <br>
BLOODAXE: He will not come. He says he's occupied. <br>
IRONGRON: Why, the insolent barbarian. Did I not need his help, I'd.
See, Bloodaxe, the first of the new weapons! Watch! <br>
(Irongron fires the flintlock and takes a chunk of wood out of the
cabinet.) <br>
BLOODAXE: Oh! Claps the ears! <br>
IRONGRON: I'll soon master the aim.

DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? <br>
RUBEISH: Joseph Rubeish. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. I'm so sorry. Hello. How do you do? <br>
(The Doctor shakes the younger man's hand. He wears thick glasses, a
bow tie and a white lab coat. The Tardis stands in the corner now.) <br>
RUBEISH: It's disgraceful, of course. Utterly disgraceful. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? What is? <br>
RUBEISH: Well, shutting us up. Like a lot of kids kept in after school.
That Brigadier chap. Military idiot. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know how you feel. Still, he means well, you know. <br>
RUBEISH: Haven't seen my wife and family for three days. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear that. <br>
RUBEISH: Ah well, just shows there's always a silver lining. And your
name? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, Smith. Doctor John Smith. <br>
RUBEISH: Oh. Seems to be a lot of them about today. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry? <br>
RUBEISH: Well, I was talking to a young woman just now, also Smith. <br>
(The door closes.) <br>
RUBEISH: Well, there she is. Miss Smith? <br>
SARAH: Yes, Professor? <br>
RUBEISH: Come and meet your namesake. Miss Lavinia Smith, Doctor er <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor John Smith. How do you do, Miss Smith? <br>
SARAH: Hello. <br>
RUBEISH: Doctor, I'm intrigued. What's that for? (the Tardis) <br>
DOCTOR: That? Oh, that, er, that contains my equipment, Professor. <br>
RUBEISH: That's original. <br>
DOCTOR: You're the virologist, Miss Smith? <br>
SARAH: Yes. Who told you? <br>
DOCTOR: I read your paper on the teleological response of the virus. A
most impressive piece of work. <br>
SARAH: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Particularly when I realise you must have written it when you
were five years old. <br>
SARAH: Ah. Er, yes, that is rather difficult to explain, isn't it. <br>
DOCTOR: But you're going to try, aren't you. <br>
SARAH: Well, my Aunt Lavinia is in America on a lecture tour, you see. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. <br>
SARAH: She had an invitation to visit here. I took her place. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
SARAH: Well, I thought all this might give me a good story. I'm a
journalist. Sarah Jane Smith. <br>
DOCTOR: You realise this is a very dangerous place to be in? <br>
SARAH: Well I can't help that. I'm stuck here now and anyway, we've got
all these soldiers looking after us. Are you going to give me away,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think. <br>
SARAH: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you can make yourself useful. We need somebody around
here to make the coffee. <br>
SARAH: If you think I'm going to spend my time making cups of coffee
for you, you're very <br>

didn't actually exist before 1850 but who cares, it really looks the
part.) <br>
ELEANOR: But for how long, Edward? How long are we to tolerate this
upstart, this insolent usurper as our neighbour? He robs, he pillages,
he murders. He flouts your authority every day, the authority which
comes from the King. <br>
EDWARD: Unfortunately, my dear, the King who gave me my authority has
taken away my troops to fight in his interminable wars. <br>
ELEANOR: Irongron's band is small, and we still have Hal the archer,
and one or two men at arms. <br>
EDWARD: I have sent letters to all our neighbours. Each, like myself,
has but a mere handful of men yet, if all these handfuls be combined
they might yet make a force that will crush this Irongron. <br>
ELEANOR: If you will excuse me, my dear, I must give orders for dinner.

IRONGRON: We shall see. <br>
BLOODAXE: He carried this. He tried to eat it when we caught him. <br>

Norman scribbles. What's it say? <br>

attack me, eh? Well, speak! <br>

EDWARD: Why does he not returned? I could have ridden to my Lord of
Salisbury's castle three times over. <br>
ELEANOR: It's not good for you to worry so much. <br>
EDWARD: How can I not worry? <br>
ELEANOR: Think that tomorrow will be brighter. Edward, I've heard that
Irongron walks his battlements every morning. <br>

IRONGRON: That strange armour you wear suits you, Linx. <br>
LINX: It is Sontaran space armour. <br>
IRONGRON: But why must we never see your face? <br>
LINX: This helmet conceals the fact that I am not to of your kind,
Irongron. You might not find my true appearance pleasing. <br>
IRONGRON: By my sword, Linx, I'll wager you're the fairest beauty in
the castle. <br>
LINX: Why did you summon me? You know my work is pressing. <br>
IRONGRON: I have a prisoner in the dungeon, a surly fellow who will not
speak. <br>
LINX: And you wish him to? <br>
IRONGRON: Yes. <br>
LINX: Then give him to me. I will make him speak. <br>
IRONGRON: Tell Bloodaxe to bring up the prisoner! <br>

IRONGRON: Well, Linx, you cunning old devil, what fresh tricks can you
show Irongron, eh? <br>
LINX: What is the nature of information you seek? <br>
IRONGRON: He is a messenger of those who plot a war against me. <br>
LINX: A war? That is excellent. <br>
IRONGRON: Oh, so you like a war, eh? <br>
LINX: Who does not? My race has been at war for millennia. There is not
a galaxy in the universe which our space fleets have not subjugated.
But you do not understand me. I am stranded on this primitive planet
when I should be leading my squadron to glory. I am an expert at war,
Irongron. <br>
IRONGRON: I know. What about those weapons you promised me? <br>
LINX: Keep your side of the bargain, I shall keep mine. You shall have
your weapons. <br>

wants.

RUBEISH: No. Who is she? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think I quite understand what you're talking about,
Professor. <br>
RUBEISH: Well, just now I was in the common room with Sir Maxwell
Dingle. I happened to mention that I was on the same landing with
Lavinia Smith the virologist. And do you know what he said? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he said that she's in America. <br>
RUBEISH: He said she's in America. How could you know? <br>

wall of the room, and Sarah shuts the main door so the soldiers on
guard cannot see them.) <br>
SARAH: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: That's my alarm clock. <br>
SARAH: Oh Doctor, kindly don't be so patronising. Now what is it
really? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a rhondium sensor. It detects delta particles. At a preset
spectrum density of fifteen ams, it oscillates this little cylinder
there, which promotes a vacuum in there which wakes me up. Clear? <br>
SARAH: Well, why do you want to be woken up when it detects delta
particles? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I'm very fond of delta particles. Why do you ask so
many questions? <br>
SARAH: Because I'm a journalist. <br>
(The Doctor leans his chair back and puts his feet on the table.) <br>
SARAH: Are you going to sleep there? <br>
DOCTOR: If you'll allow me to do so. Good night, Miss Smith. <br>

cubicle.) <br>
RUBEISH: Psst. Shouldn't we tell the Brigadier? <br>
DOCTOR: Tell the Brigadier what? <br>
RUBEISH: About her. <br>
DOCTOR: I think we can decide what to do about Miss Smith in the
morning, Professor. If we're all still here.

then he will attack. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh no he hasn't. I just got a fix on him. There's something
very odd indeed going on. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, if I may say so, Doctor, that is not exactly news
to me. <br>
DOCTOR: Someone's operating a matter transmitter. And the really odd
thing is, there's a time transference too. It's being worked from
several centuries ago. Past and present mixed up. Very interesting,
that. <br>
(Sarah is at the open Tardis door.) <br>
SARAH: (sotto) Professor Rubeish, are you in there? <br>
(Sarah enters the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can't stay here chatting, old boy. Got to get after
Rubeish. <br>
BRIGADIER: Look, Doctor, I forbid you to go off in that contraption.
There's no telling where you'll finish up. Remember what happened to
you on Metebelis Three. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I got there, didn't I? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, eventually, after several detours. <br>
DOCTOR: Brigadier, a straight line may be the shortest distance between
two points, but it is by no means the most interesting. Goodbye, old

serving wenches. That's it, isn't it? Mind you, I think you've

IRONGRON: How say you? <br>
LINX: The girl is not of your kind, Irongron. The hair is finer, the
thorax of a different construction. <br>
IRONGRON: Oh, hell's teeth, have you no girls beyond the stars? No
women to do the lowly work? <br>
LINX: Ah, I understand. You have a primary and secondary reproductive
cycle. It is an inefficient system, you should change it. <br>
IRONGRON: You what? <br>
LINX: At the Sontaran Military Academy, we have hatchings of a million
cadets at each muster parade. Thus we can sustain enormous casualties
on all battle fronts. <br>

into the hall.) <br>

LINX: It cannot answer you. It is just a suit of steel. It is empty. <br>
IRONGRON: But it walks. <br>
LINX: It walks and it fights! Irongron, is it a good weapon? <br>
IRONGRON: Does it kill? <br>
LINX: It does nothing else and it cannot be killed. <br>
IRONGRON: By heavens, Linx, can you make me more of these? <br>
LINX: If you wish. <br>

how the iron man works! <br>

DOCTOR: Obviously working some sort of ocular device. Professor, have
you any idea where you are? <br>

carvings on some of theses columns. They're astonishingly well
preserved. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you're in a castle all right. But do you know the

RUBEISH: About four in the afternoon. We haven't had breakfast yet, you
know. Doesn't feed us much. Once a day if we're lucky. <br>

so steel yourself. You have been brought back to the early years of the

you realise the harm that you'll cause? <br>

conquer the whole kingdom. Well, who knows what other sorceries he may

SARAH: All right, I'll tell you how. Now, the first thing we must do is
grab the Doctor and get him away from Irongron. <br>
EDWARD: And force him to make his magic for me? Ah ha, good thought.
Aye, but how could it be done? <br>

him. <br>

Nasty, brutish and short just about sums him up. <br>

SARAH: Well, he says he wasn't serving Irongron, and there is another
stranger at the castle. Someone called Linx. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he's your enemy, I assure you, not me. We'd be well
advised to join forces against him. <br>
EDWARD: Does he speak truth? <br>
SARAH: I'm not sure. I suppose I could have been wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a generous admission. Especially coming from one of the

SARAH: Or he could just be changing sides to save his own skin. <br>
ELEANOR: These wizards and warlocks were ever a treacherous breed. We'd
best be wary of him. <br>

DOCTOR: My services are at your disposal, sir. Such as they are. <br>

heard this said from his own mouth. <br>

DOCTOR: On the contrary, sir, I think we can. <br>
EDWARD: But how? With a handful of men? <br>

that we have a full garrison. <br>

RUBEISH: It's very deep. Narcoleptic condition, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: The brain can still receive signals, Professor. It might work. <br>
RUBEISH: Even if it does, can't see what you intend. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you want to get back to the twentieth century? <br>
RUBEISH: Steak and mushrooms, lobster, chocolate truffles. Oh dear me,
yes. <br>
DOCTOR: If I can get these people to respond, I can send them back to
their own time with Linx's osmic projector. <br>
RUBEISH: Osmic projector? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's over there on the table. Take a look. <br>
SARAH: Why can't you just send them as they are? <br>
DOCTOR: It's too risky with their minds in this state. The transition
might damage them permanently. <br>
SARAH: I've never heard so much gobbledegook in my life, but I expect
you know what you're talking about. <br>

tries to stand then falls over again.) <br>
LINX: Work. What's wrong with you? Get up or I will kill you! <br>
DOCTOR: Leave him, Linx! <br>
LINX: Ah. How fortunate that you have returned, Doctor. My failure to
destroy you was the one thing that marred the pleasure of my
approaching departure from this miserable planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don't you want to know why I returned? <br>
LINX: It is of no interest to me. <br>
DOCTOR: I came here to offer you my help. <br>
LINX: We're sworn enemies, Doctor. Why should you help me? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I want something from you. If you will let me
de-hypnotise people and send them home, and help me capture Irongron
and his men, then I will assist you in the repairs to your spaceship.
Now, the weapons that you've made for Irongron you can leave here in
the castle, and when it's empty, you can take off, destroying castle
and weapons at the same time. All right, Commander Linx, what do you
say? <br>
LINX: You wish for my answer, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I do. <br>

LINX: Your Time Lord philosophy is egalitarian twaddle. It is a
weakness. <br>
DOCTOR: Every species has its own weakness, Linx. For instance, you can
only be stunned by a blow on the probic vent, that small hole at the
back of your neck. <br>
LINX: In our case, Doctor, it is a strength, because it means we must
always face our enemies. <br>

who made me, my master, Commander Linx. <br>
IRONGRON: It is indeed the robot, Bloodaxe, though somewhat different
in shape. And I remember, Linx promised to make me a second iron man,
one that would obey my voice. But why has Linx sent you? Why has he not
he himself obeyed my summons? <br>

RUBEISH: I really don't think I ought to go and leave you. <br>
SARAH: Off you go now. Now then. This, this and this. <br>
RUBEISH: Well, goodbye and good luck. It really has been a most
fascinating experience. I hope you and the Doctor will be all right.
See you back at the Research Centre. <br>
(Rubeish disappears. Linx throws the Doctor across the room.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
(Linx picks up his ray gun as Irongron enters.) <br>
IRONGRON: So, destroy my castle by sorcery, would you, toad face? Well,
Irongron's magic is too strong for you! <br>
(Irongron raises his sword and Linx kills him. Then Linx goes into his
spaceship and adjusts some controls.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Irongron's hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Hal wakes, goes to Bloodaxe and shakes him.) <br>
HAL: Now listen, dog. In minutes now this castle will be destroyed by
the sorcery. If you'd save your miserable skins, then get you gone! <br>
(Hal runs out, and his words finally make it through to Bloodaxe's
brain.) <br>
BLOODAXE: Flee, dogs! Flee for your life! Come on, waken, you dogs! And
flee, flee for your lives, you dogs! Waken! Waken up! Now flee! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Linx's workshop]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SARAH: Doctor, do get up. We've got to get you
out! <br>
(Hal runs in. The spaceship door is closing, but the archer still
manages to loose an arrow straight into Linx's probic vent. As he dies,
Linx hits a large switch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Something's gone wrong. He must have hit the take off button
too soon. Come on, we've got about a minute to get out of here. Quick,
run! <br>
(Computer equipment starts to explode and the spaceship glows red.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Forest]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The explosion knocks the Doctor, Sarah and Hal to
the ground. They get up, dust the leaf litter off and walk over to the
Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you can tell Sir Edward that his problems are over, Hal.
Irongron, his castle, his magic weapons and his sorcerer, they're all
destroyed. <br>
HAL: Will you not tell him yourself, Doctor? He will reward you well.
We owe you much. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I'm afraid we must be off. Goodbye, Hal. <br>
HAL: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
SARAH: Goodbye. <br>
HAL: Goodbye. You are truly a great magician, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: To tell you the truth, Hal, I'm not a magician at all. <br>
SARAH: I'm not so sure about that. <br>
(The Doctor and Sarah go into the Tardis, and it dematerialises.) </font>
