note: Watching this one gave me a headache, literally, what with the static flashes and
frequent point of view changes - colour for a person, black and white
for external. Yes, Mister Gatiss, very clever I'm sure. So I haven't
documented them all. I just cannot be bothered. Just the important (I
think) ones.</i>)<br>

(A screen full of static.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN [OC]: You
must <em>not</em> watch this. <br>
(The image clears to reveal a man's face. He wears large spectacles,
and speaks directly to the viewer.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN: I'm warning you. You can never unsee it. (static
flicker)&nbsp; But if you do watch.&nbsp;Gagan Rassmussen.
I'm Gagan Rassmussen.
This is Le Verrier lab in orbit around Neptune.
<br>
(He turns as something large groans unseen in the background.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN: I've put things together into some kind of order
so that you can,er, understand, so that you can have some idea. There
are bits missing. Sorry about that.
I don't fully understand what's been going on here, &nbsp;but,
er, this is what happened.<br>

which actually spell out the names of the characters and location
across, and Doctor Who illuminated vertically.<br>

RASSMUSSEN [OC]: They came from Triton.&nbsp;This is
Chopra.&nbsp;Bit of an attitude, in my opinion.<br>
(A stocky soldier with a white face that has black lines up and down
and across it turns away.)<br>
NAGATA: (woman with a Geordie accent) Calm down, pet.<br>
CHOPRA: Well, it's ridiculous. That thing's meant to be a lethal
fighting machine
and it just moons around like a love-sick puppy.<br>
(A soldier sits up from from an opening pod and puts on his helmet.
Neon blue tubes are still attached to him.)<br>
DEEP-ANDO: I could hear you ranting from inside the pod, Chopra,
for the Gods' sake. <br>
NAGATA: Feel better?
<br>
RASSMUSSEN [OC]: Commander Nagata.&nbsp;Young, for the
responsibility.&nbsp;Quite a baptism of fire, I'm afraid.<br>
(Nagata. (Jagganth Daiki-Nagata) Age: 30. Rank: Officer 2nd Class.
Survival rating 8/10<br>
DEEP-ANDO: Marvellous, ma'am.
All hail, Morpheus, eh?

RASSMUSSEN [OC]: Deep-Ando. Conscript. Likes to think of himself as
the joker of this little group.&nbsp;Well, he <em>did</em>.<br>
(Deep-Ando. (Haruka Deep-Ando) Age: 40. Rank: Conscript 2nd Class.
Survival rating 6/10)<br>
CHOPRA: Morpheus, Morpheus, Morpheus. Sleep's the one thing left to us.
The one thing they couldn't get their filthy mitts on.
Now, they're even grabbing that. Colonising it.
<br>
NAGATA: Spoken like a true Rip.
<br>
CHOPRA: Oh, don't call me that.
<br>
NAGATA:&nbsp;Don't call me that, ma'am. Give it a rest, pet. <br>
CHOPRA: Give what a rest?
<br>
NAGATA: This is a mission, Chopra. We find out what's happened on Le
Verrier
and then we all go home. Keep your politics to yourself, okay?
<br>
DEEP-ANDO: I know someone who'd love to get Chopra
back home to Triton, eh? Ho-ho!<br>
(He goes to the person with the strange face.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN [OC]: This one's obvious from the markings, isn't
it.&nbsp;We all know a Grunt when we see one.<br>
(474. Age 5. Rank: Grunt. Survival rating 9/10.)<br>
(474 takes a step forward and Deep-Ando backs away, hands raised.)<br>
DEEP-ANDO: Whoa, whoa.<br>
NAGATA: Come on. Behave.<br>
(We see they are flying through space to a satellite station above a
very blue gas giant.)<br>
NAGATA: Nearly there, kiddies.<br>
RASSMUSSEN [OC]: These are the rescue crew.&nbsp;Don't get too
attached.&nbsp;Everything you're about to see is from their
individual viewpoints or
taken from the station itself. <br>
(A monitor says 2 minutes to docking.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN [OC]: The only footage available.<br>
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: They came to find me. This is my station. My lab. <br>
<br>

<br>
RASSMUSSEN [OC]: I've pieced together the rescue as best I
could.&nbsp;If you're going to watch, then pay close
attention.&nbsp;Your lives may depend on it.<br>
(The team go down the docking tunnel to the station itself. Static
flash on screen.)<br>
NAGATA: Emergency lighting only.<br>
CHOPRA: Grav and orbit's stable. There must be power.
<br>
(The doors to the docking tunnel close and they move on, lighting the
way with flashlights on their rifles.)<br>
NAGATA: Nothing?<br>
(474 shakes her head.)<br>
NAGATA: No sign of anyone.<br>
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: There was no crew. No crew left. They did find others,
though. Strangers.<br>

NAGATA: What the hell happened here?<br>
474: Hide seek. Maybe they play hide seek.
<br>
CHOPRA: Hide <em>and</em> seek! Why do they miss out words?
It's infuriating.<br>
474: Chopra, don't be anger.<br>
CHOPRA:&nbsp;Don't be an-<em>gry</em>! Is it so hard to
breed them to speak properly?
<br>
DEEP-ANDO: Oh, lighten up.<br>
(474 holds up a clenched fist and they all stop.)<br>
CHOPRA: What now? <br>
474: Talk.<br>
CHOPRA: What? <br>
474: People talk.<br>
CLARA [OC]: Do you ever get the feeling like you're being watched?
<br>
(The soldiers move quietly but quickly to a junction with another
corridor.)<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Paranoia.<br>
CLARA [OC]: Why is it so dark?
<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Night-time setting.
Faulty filament. Three-day week.<br>
CLARA [OC]: So, orbit around Neptune?
<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Yeah. This close into the planet,
they must have some pretty powerful
anti-grav shielding on board.
<br>
(Clara's flash light reveals an oriental mask on a red wall.)<br>
CLARA: Looks like a Japanese restaurant. Oh! Have you brought me
to a space restaurant?<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: People never do that, you know?
<br>
CLARA: Do what?
<br>
DOCTOR: They never put the word&nbsp;space in front of something
just because everything's all
sort of hi-tech and future-y.
It's never&nbsp;space restaurant
or space champagne or&nbsp;space, you know, hat. It's
just&nbsp;restaurant,&nbsp;champagne or&nbsp;hat.<br>
(The soldiers follow them as they walk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Even if this was a restaurant<br>
CLARA: What about spacesuit? <br>
DOCTOR: Pedant.<br>
(The Doctor and Clara turn as they hear the energy rifles powering up,
eyes wide like rabbits in caught in car headlights.)<br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
CLARA: Are you crew? Are you crew?<br>
(The Doctor carefully reaches into his inside jacket pocket and gets
out his psychic paper. He holds up up to each soldier until -)<br>
NAGATA: Engineering stress assessors?<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, we are.<br>
(He puts the psychic paper away again.)<br>
DOCTOR: We're here to, er.
<br>
CLARA: We're here to assess stress.
<br>
DOCTOR: Stress. <br>
NAGATA: So, what happened?
<br>
DOCTOR: From the beginning of time? That's a very long story.
<br>
CLARA: (sotto) Doctor.<br>
DOCTOR: Well. Well, we just arrived, you know, and there was nobody
about. What are you doing here?<br>
(Nagata lowers her rifle.)<br>
NAGATA: Twenty four hours ago, this station fell silent. No comm
signal. Nothing. Dead. We've come to find out why.<br>
DOCTOR: Theories?<br>
NAGATA: Could be anything. Meteorite strike. Space pirates.<br>
CLARA: Ah, see? Not just&nbsp;pirates, <em>space</em>
pirates.
<br>
DOCTOR: So, what, you are
a rescue mission? <br>
NAGATA: Yes.
<br>
DOCTOR: Of four? <br>
NAGATA: Cuts, pet. Right, you're to consider yourself<br>
DOCTOR: (sings) ♪ Part of the furniture! ♪<br>
NAGATA: Under my command.<br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Really? <br>
NAGATA: Yes, really.&nbsp;Come on.<br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Okay.<br>
(The Doctor and Clara follow at a short distance.)<br>
CLARA: We still don't know where we are.<br>
DOCTOR: Indo-Japanese.<br>
(He wets his finger and holds it behind his right ear. We are
apparently watching from a wall screen.)<br>
DOCTOR: Thirty eighth century. (tastes his finger again.) Tuesday. <br>
CLARA: Thirty eighth century?<br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. After the Great Catastrophe, there was a tectonic
realignment. India
and Japan, they were sort of merged.<br>
CLARA: We still don't know where the rest of the crew are, though.
I mean, a place this size? Hey, what?&nbsp;Great Catastrophe? What
Great Catastrophe?<br>
DOCTOR: Well, you've got all that to look forward to, haven't you?
Mind you, this place looks as if it's been dead for a long while now.
<br>
(He runs his finger along an edge then blows a lot of dust off it, and
looks straight at us. Static flicker to change of scene / viewpoint.
They have caught up with the soldiers again.)<br>
DOCTOR: What is it?<br>
CLARA: I still can't shake the feeling.<br>
474: Eyes. Watch. Eyes in sky.<br>
CHOPRA: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
<br>
474: Chopra not worry. 474 protect Chopra. Chopra pretty.<br>
(474 reaches to stroke Chopra's cheek and he slaps the hand away.)<br>
CHOPRA: Oh, for the Gods'. Just back off!<br>
(Chopra pushes 474 who reacts by getting behind him and putting on a
choke hold.)<br>
DEEP-ANDO Oh, come on now.<br>
NAGATA: Let him go, pet! <br>
474: 474 sorry.<br>
NAGATA: Let him go, now! <br>
474: Not help it!<br>
(The software display tells us that 474 is programmed to respond to
physical threat. She releases Chopra from the choke hold and crouches
by the wall, whimpering.)<br>
CHOPRA: It could have killed me!<br>
NAGATA: That's how they're grown. You know that. They react to any
attack.
<br>
CLARA: Grown? <br>
NAGATA: They might not give them much upstairs, but our friend here
certainly knows how to fight.
<br>
(The Doctor kneels in front of 474.)<br>
NAGATA: You'd be glad of her in a tight corner, I'll bet.
<br>
CLARA: What does she mean,&nbsp;grown?<br>
DOCTOR: She's a Grunt, Clara. They're bred in hatcheries. Cloned
muscles. Low intelligence. Brute force. Instant army.<br>
CLARA: That's disgusting.<br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's how they roll in the thirty eighth century.<br>
(Something large growls and moans.)<br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Hold my hand.<br>
CLARA: I'm okay.<br>
DOCTOR: I'm not.<br>
(Clara takes the Doctor's hand.)<br>
(Another growl nearby, and they panic as the lights on the rifles
briefly illuminate two humanoid creatures ahead of them.. Some shots
are fired, then they turn and -)<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, run, run, run! Run! Run!
<br>
(At a junction.)<br>
DEEP-ANDO: Follow me! Straight ahead.<br>
NAGATA: No! This way! Deep-Ando!<br>
DEEP-ANDO [OC]: Come on!<br>
<br>
<b>[Laboratory]</b><br>
<br>
DOCTOR: Quick! Push anything in front of it!
We've got to keep them out!
<br>
(The Doctor moves a cabinet as Chopra tries to push the door shut.)<br>
NAGATA: Deep-Ando! We've lost him! What the hell are they?<br>
DOCTOR: Not pirates.
<br>
NAGATA: We've got to get Deep-Ando!
<br>
DOCTOR: Where's your friend?<br>
CHOPRA: Deep-Ando? I dunno. He's
<br>
NAGATA: He's still out there!
<br>
(The creatures are pushing at the door. One thrusts an arm through the
gap.)<br>
NAGATA: 474!<br>
(474 charges the door, shutting it and cutting off the arm, which turns
to sand and falls to the floor.)<br>
NAGATA: What the hell are they? Where did they go?<br>
<br>
<b>[Corridor]</b><br>

DEEP-ANDO: Chief Nagata, this is Deep-Ando. Where did you
go?&nbsp;Nagata, this is Deep-Ando. May the Gods look favourably
upon you. (static) May the Gods. Are you there?<br>
(He walks on, sweeping his flash light around as he goes.)<br>

NAGATA: Deep-Ando, this is Nagata. May the Gods look favourably upon
you.
Deep-Ando, are you there?<br>
(The Doctor takes a sample of the sand from the floor and puts it under
a microscope.)<br>
NAGATA: What are you doing?<br>
DOCTOR: Finding out what they're made of.<br>
NAGATA: Deep-Ando, are you there?<br>
CHOPRA: Send the Grunt.<br>
NAGATA: No.<br>
CHOPRA: Why not? That's what it's for. Look, he's still out there! You
can't just abandon him.
<br>
NAGATA: I need proper intel before
I risk anyone else, including 474.
Keep trying the comms.<br>
CHOPRA: Deep-Ando, may the Gods look favourably upon you.
<br>
NAGATA: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Organic. Definitely organic. Blood cells. Skin cells. Mucus.<br>
474: Deep-Ando, may the Gods look favourably upon you. Deep-Ando.<br>
(Clara is standing between two large white cabinets.)<br>
CLARA: What are these? <br>
CHOPRA: Morpheus?
<br>
CLARA: Morpheus?
Named after the God of Dreams? Oh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah. Not just this.
<br>
(She indicates her pretty face.)<br>
CLARA: So, what are they, then? Sleep pods?
<br>
CHOPRA: More than that.
(static) Deep-Ando? Deep-Ando, can you hear me? <br>
NAGATA: Keep trying.
<br>
DOCTOR: I could take a look at that. You know, triangulate the signal,
help you find your friend.<br>
NAGATA: First, tell me what those things are.
<br>
CHOPRA: Deep, Deep-Ando.
<br>
DEEP-ANDO [OC]: (sotto)&nbsp;This is Deep

CHOPRA: Deep-Ando, this is Chopra. I'm getting a signal. Deep-Ando, can
you hear me? Deep-Ando? Deep-Ando, this is Chopra. Can you hear me?
<br>
CLARA: Doctor! <br>
(Thud. Clara has disappeared inside a Morpheus cabinet.)<br>
DOCTOR: Clara!<br>
(An alarm sounds, then four small holographic ladies in Dior New Style
dresses with full skirts appear on the cabinet and start singing Pat
Ballard's 1954 hit, just like the Chordettes did.)<br>
SINGERS: ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom. Mister Sandman, bring me your
dreams. ♪<br>
DOCTOR: Clara!

NAGATA: It's fine, it's just Morpheus.
<br>
SINGERS: ♪ Make him the cutest that I've ever seen. ♪<br>
(The singers vanish as the Doctor opens the cabinet. Clara is lying
there, eyes closed and with neon blue tubes attached to her head and
hands.)<br>
DOCTOR: What did you think you were doing?<br>
(She opens her eyes and he removes the tubing.)<br>
CLARA: Huh? (she sits up) It dragged me in. The wires, they were like
snakes, like it was alive. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you okay?
<br>
CLARA: Yeah. It just kind of flicked over my eyes. Did I sleep?
<br>
CHOPRA: Yeah, you did. <br>
CLARA: Why, why did it just grab at me?
<br>
DOCTOR: Semi-sentient. It thinks it knows what's good for you.
You obviously needed forty winks. Clever little sleep pod. You said it
was something more than that, though.
<br>
(Static flicker on picture.)<br>
NAGATA: Come on, everyone knows. <br>
DOCTOR: (to camera) Well, let's just say, for the sake of argument,
that we don't. What is
Morpheus?
<br>
474: Last pod.&nbsp;This pod. Not empty.<br>

last pod.)<br>
SINGERS: ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom. ♪<br>

glasses then tries to force down the shutter over the observation hatch
where the sleeper's head should be.)<br>
DOCTOR: It's almost like someone's<br>

CLARA: Careful! <br>
(Weapons are powered up.)<br>
CLARA: Here. Let me try.<br>

cover.)<br>
CLARA: Hellooo? It's okay.

we?

I did. But er, this man, the Doctor, he wanted explanations first. So<br>

PRESENTER: May the Gods look favourably upon us all.
Friends. We live in a time of unparalleled prosperity. A golden age of
peace, harmony and industry.
But every shift must come to an end. Every working day must stop. <br>
(A holographic yawning woman appears on her outsized hand.) <br>
PRESENTER: Of
course, we can take stimulants
to make that deadline, to keep us propped up through that important
meeting. But always, always, sleep claims us in the end. <br>

PRESENTER: Until now. <br>

CLARA: A month? <br>
PRESENTER: All the chemical benefits of rest, but freeing up the nights
to
continue working, working, working.

CLARA: When?<br>
DOCTOR: Well, when you're not looking. <br>
(The Doctor leans forward and stares at us. The viewpoint turns look at
the next speaker, and keeps swinging around as others join in the
conversation.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Morpheus is mine. My invention. It's changed Triton society
forever.<br>
DOCTOR: So, how does it work?<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Er, the pod sends out a coded electronic signal that acts
on certain
parts of the brain. Changes the fundamental chemistry.<br>
CHOPRA: It's disgusting. Making people into bloody drones. I've said it
before
<br>
NAGATA: Aye, you have.
<br>
CHOPRA: Colonising our sleep. Is nothing sacred?
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: We spend a third of our lives asleep. And time is money.
<br>
NAGATA: He's right, man. It's amazing. Everyone on Triton's using it.<br>
DOCTOR: Are they now?&nbsp;Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleeve
of care. The death of each
day's life, sore labour's bath. Balm of hurt minds, chief nourisher in
life's great feast. Congratulations, Professor. You've revolutionised the labour market.
You've conquered nature.<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Thank you.<br>
DOCTOR: You've also created an abomination.<br>
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: The Doctor said that we had to find the other soldier.
And to find answers. So, we left the lab. He thought that there was
some connection between my Morpheus process
and those creatures that attacked us.
&nbsp;Anyway, you'll see, he had a theory.<br>

<b>[Corridor]</b><br>

(We are watching from Clara's viewpoint.)<br>
CHOPRA: Sleep dust? <br>
DOCTOR: Sleep dust. <br>
NAGATA: You're kidding.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well do I look like I'm kidding? Is this a kidding face? Ask
the crew of this station if they're
kidding. Or what's left of them.<br>
NAGATA: But sleep dust? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. The stuff in the corner of your eye. The stuff you
wipe away every morning when you wake up.
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: That's ridiculous.
This is getting us nowhere.
<br>
CLARA: Okay, how, Doctor? How can those things be made
of&nbsp;sleep dust?
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, when we sleep, the mucus crust builds up in our eyes.
Blood
cells, skin cells. That's what dust largely is. Human skin.
But your meddling has evolved it. Hot-housed it.
What used to be sleep in your eye has turned into a carnivorous life
form.
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: You can't just throw accusations like that around!
<br>
CLARA [OC]: So, the longer you're in Morpheus, the more the dust builds
up?
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: That's slander!<br>
(Static flicker.)<br>
DOCTOR: Lying there in those pods, people are a ready-made food source.
<br>
CLARA [OC]: Well, where are they, then?<br>
(We switch to Nagata's viewpoint.)<br>
CLARA: Where's the crew?<br>

NAGATA: What about us? We've all used the pods back on Triton. <br>
CHOPRA: Not all of us. <br>
NAGATA: This isn't a good time to be smug, pet. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my guess is that the ones you're using are pretty
primitive
compared to what's going on up here. These are a sort of a Mark Two,
yeah?<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Obviously, I have tried to improve the process. Speed
things up.<br>
DOCTOR: You've succeeded there.<br>
NAGATA: But how does the dust become those creatures? <br>
DOCTOR: You saw what happened. The dust conglomerates and moulds itself
into&nbsp;humanoid form. It's
adaptable. It's clever.<br>
(A loud long noise nearby. They power the weapons up.)<br>
DOCTOR: And it's coming for us.<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Look, you came to rescue the crew. I'm crew, so rescue me! <br>
CLARA: How come you're the only one left? <br>
RASSMUSSEN: Because I hid. I hid in the only place I thought those
monsters wouldn't find me. &nbsp;Look, we've got to get out of here!<br>
DOCTOR: No. We can't leave this place until there's not a trace of the
dust or

DEEP-ANDO: But you know who I am. You've just called me by my name. <br>
COMPUTER: 'Nevertheless.

DEEP-ANDO: I don't!<br>

(Two of the creatures are there.)<br>
DEEP-ANDO: Let me in!<br>
(Deep-Ando screams. The bulkhead doors close in front of the creatures.
In the observation room, with a nice big window looking out on Neptune,
Deep-Ando checks his station schematic projected onto it. Then he turns
to see the gaping maw of a creature.)<br>
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Er, he was the first of them to die. We heard the scream
but er, well, we, we had our own problems.<br>

something for dear life.)<br>
CHOPRA: What's happening? <br>
NAGATA: Engines?<br>
CHOPRA: No! It's the gravity shields! They're failing! <br>
(Neptune is getting closer through the window.)<br>
DOCTOR: Nagata! That thing, the schematic. Give it to me! <br>
NAGATA: Who the hell do you think you are? <br>
DOCTOR: Me? I'm in charge. <br>
NAGATA: You have no authority<br>
DOCTOR: No, but I'm in charge. I can bypass the main systems and reboot

CLARA: Listen to him, for God's sake! He knows what he's talking about!
<br>
(Nagata lets go to hand the Doctor her helmet and they slide on the
floor.)<br>
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor, if the grav-shields are decaying<br>
DOCTOR: Don't say it. Please don't say it!<br>
CLARA: We're being pulled towards Neptune!<br>
CHOPRA: Oh, Gods! Oh, Gods! Oh, Gods!<br>
DOCTOR: Hang on!<br>
CLARA: Argh, this day couldn't get any worse! <br>
(A creature smashes a small glass window in the door, and opens it. The
Doctor is projecting the schematic onto a cabinet door.)<br>
DOCTOR: I can do this! I can fix this!<br>
RASSMUSSEN: No! Please! Help me. Argh!<br>

CLARA: No! No!<br>

(A creature reaches out, bits falling off it. Static flicker.)<br>
DOCTOR: We're back online! Grav-shields fixed! We're rising! Go. let's

NAGATA: No, I'm not.<br>
CLARA: What about the others? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
CLARA: We have to go after them.<br>
DOCTOR: Don't be ridiculous. <br>
CLARA: Doctor!<br>
NAGATA: They're under my command. I owe it to them. <br>
DOCTOR: To die? They wouldn't thank you for that. Nor you, Clara. To
die, to die. Glamis hath murdered sleep, therefore Cawdor shall
sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more. <br>
NAGATA: What?<br>
(Clara's point of view.)<br>
DOCTOR: Shakespeare. He really knew his stuff. They all did. The
Ancients. The
poets. All those sad songs. All those lullabies.
Sleep is essential to every sentient being in the universe. But to
humans. Greedy, filthy, stupid humans. It's an inconvenience to be
bartered away. Well, now we know the truth. Sleep isn't just a
function. It's blessed.
Every night we dive deep into that inky pool, deep into the arms of
Morpheus. Every morning, we wake up
and wipe the sleep from our eyes, and that keeps us safe. Safe from the
monsters inside.<br>
NAGATA: Well, the bloody monsters are outside now. What do we do?<br>
(Thud! They turn and move into the area where meat is hanging from
hooks in labelled covers.)<br>
NAGATA: Dead meat.<br>
<br>
<b>[Corridor]</b><br>

CHOPRA: Dear Gods, what are we going to do?<br>
474: Get ship. Go home.<br>
CHOPRA: We can't let those things off here. If they were to get out, to
spread. It's like an infection. You don't
understand, do you?<br>
474: Sleepmen bad. Kill sleepmen.<br>
CHOPRA: Yeah. That about sums it up. Chief Nagata, this is Chopra. May
the Gods look favourably upon you. Chief Nagata, this is Chopra. May
the. We'll head for the rescue ship. If we don't hear from them soon,
I'm going to have to assume they're dead. <br>
474: Then what Chopra do?<br>
CHOPRA: I have no choice. I'll have to destroy this whole station. <br>
<br>

on the wall of himself and Clara when they first came on board.)<br>
NAGATA: What are you doing?
<br>
DOCTOR: I've hacked into your helmet cams. <br>
NAGATA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Reviewing the footage. There's something not right here.
<br>
NAGATA: We don't have helmet cams. <br>
DOCTOR: Why did it kill Rassmussen like that?<br>
CLARA: That's what they do, isn't it? Kill people? <br>
(The Doctor removes his glasses.)<br>
DOCTOR: But that's a direct attack. That's not how they operate. Dust
grows. Consumes the host.<br>
CLARA: They evolve. You said so yourself.<br>
DOCTOR: Maybe. There's something going on here. Something we're not
getting.<br>

<br>
CLARA: What now? We can't stay in here. We're going to freeze to death.
And we can't go back out there because the Sandmen will get us. <br>

DOCTOR: Sandmen?<br>
CLARA: Yeah, it's a good name. It fits, like the song. ♪ Bom, bom, bom.

DOCTOR: No, you don't get to name things. I'm the Doctor. I do the

CLARA: All right. Sorry.<br>
DOCTOR: It's like the Silurians all over again.<br>
CLARA: Okay, well, what would you prefer then? The&nbsp;Dustmen? <br>
DOCTOR: Sandmen. (to Nagata) What did you just say? <br>
CLARA: When? <br>
DOCTOR: One point eight three minutes ago. <br>
NAGATA: I said we don't have helmet cams.<br>
(Banging on the door. Roaring. They hide amongst the hanging meat.)<br>
CLARA: Doctor, that door isn't going to last much longer. <br>
NAGATA: So, what do we do?<br>
DOCTOR: We let them in.<br>
NAGATA: What?<br>
DOCTOR: We let them in.<br>
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Hmm. Clever, that. Clever strategy. If they'd stayed in
there, they'd have frozen to death, so the Doctor
had to let the creatures in. That was his theory. Oh, I'm not dead. You've probably guessed that by now.<br>
<br>
(The sound of heartbeats as the creatures
prowl the cold storage. Our heroes are hiding inside empty meat sacks.
Suddenly, Boom!)<br>

474: What happen?<br>
CHOPRA: Must be damage from when we fell out of orbit. <br>
(There is a fire blocking the corridor in front of them.)<br>
CHOPRA: We have to go back.<br>
(But there is at least one Sandman behind them.)<br>
CHOPRA: I don't know what to do. I can't save us. <br>
474: 474 can. <br>

flames.)<br>

(The Doctor looks out of his sack then gestures, first covering his
eyes then the shush sign.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN [OC]: The Doctor worked it out. The creatures can't see.<br>
(Clara gestures to Nagata. They tiptoe past the Sandmen then the Doctor
accidentally kicks something, alerting them.)<br>
DOCTOR: Run! Engine room! <br>
(He shuts the Sandmen in the cold store.)<br>
<br>

474: 474 die soon.<br>
CHOPRA: No, no, no. Don't, don't say that! You got us through. You can

(There are Sandmen cowering on the other side of the flames.)<br>
474: Chopra go. Get ship. Chopra be safe. Chopra pretty.<br>
(Chopra takes 474's hand, then she pushes him away. He leaves as the
first Sandman braves the flames and walks through them. We get a very
good view of them, with vertical maws running down their throats, hands
reaching out blindly. 474 picks up her rifle and runs towards them.)<br>

<b>[Engine room]</b><br>
<br>
DOCTOR: You said you felt like you were being watched, Clara. <br>
CLARA: Paranoia, you said. <br>
DOCTOR: Not this time. <br>
(He puts his sunglasses on a ledge and projects an image onto the wall.)<br>
DOCTOR: There is a feed. Wireless. These images are being stored by
someone. Collated. Nagata, look at this footage. What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it? <br>
NAGATA: Don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, there's one very obvious thing about it. Do you see it
yet? No? Okay, I'll tell you what's wrong. There's footage here of
everyone. But what's missing in all of it? What can't you see anywhere?
Not in the footage, not on this ship. Look. Really look. There are no
cameras here. No CCTV. No helmet cams. So, how and why does this
footage even exist? The dust has been watching us. Each little organic
speck, just a tiny spy drifting through the air. The monsters have been
with us all along. That's why the Sandmen are blind. Their visual
receptors are being hijacked. But by whom, and why? And then, there's
this.<br>
(The projected image is the now, the Doctor pointing over his shoulder
at the image, showing him pointing over his shoulder at the image ad
infinitum.)<br>
DOCTOR: That's you, Clara. That's you, looking at me.<br>
CLARA: Me?<br>
DOCTOR: You went into the pod. The Morpheus process has begun.<br>
CLARA: Er, well.<br>
DOCTOR: There's nothing here from Chopra's point of view because he
refuses to
use Morpheus. But everybody else is here. Including you. You don't have
a camera, Clara. But you will have by now, sleep in your eye.<br>
CLARA: Okay, well, we'll fix this. You will fix this.<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm sure it'll be fine. I'm sure you'll be fine. <br>
CLARA: Sure?<br>
DOCTOR: We will sort this, Clara. We'll sort you. We'll sort Nagata,
and everyone back on Triton. And then we will destroy Morpheus forever.
<br>
CLARA: Okay then. Let's get on with it. The power's been almost
entirely out since we arrived, but we've still got emergency lighting.
But the engines are still on.<br>
DOCTOR: Well, there was that incident with the grav-shields, but. Ah. <br>
CLARA: What, what, what, what, what?<br>
DOCTOR: The grav-shields didn't fail. They were deliberately powered
down.<br>
NAGATA: By the Sandmen?<br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's not their style, is it? <br>
(He picks up two disconnected power couplings.)<br>
DOCTOR: It's like, it's like something's been kept here, near the
engines, where it's hot. Like something's being kept alive.<br>

RASSMUSSEN [OC]: Gagan Rassmussen. I'm Gagan Rassmussen. This is Le
Verrier lab in orbit
around Neptune. I've put things together into some kind of order.<br>
DOCTOR: You had that prepared well in advance, didn't you? Your
statement. Your
alibi. There would inevitably be questions when you got to Triton.
So, you needed to get your story straight. <br>
RASSMUSSEN [OC]: This is what happened.<br>
(A portion of hull slides back by the closed pod.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN: You can't fight them, Doctor. There's no point. They're the
future. A new life form. A <em>better</em> life form. That's
very clear to me now. They've made me understand. And we're to be their
food, and that's only correct. I just needed to find a way to get them
off this station,
and back to Triton. And then, they'll spread.
Spread everywhere. <br>
CLARA: And that's what you want? You're helping them wipe out humanity!<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Things have been made very clear to me! <br>
NAGATA: But we saw you die. The Sandmen swallowed you.<br>
DOCTOR: I think the Professor has been playing a long game. Am I right?
<br>
RASSMUSSEN: They speak to me in my mind. Trust me, I think. But they're
like children. Babies. So new. Evolving. Hungry. Always so hungry. I
made them understand. We had to find a way out. And then there'd be new
food sources. Unlimited. So, they spared me.
And we waited.<br>
DOCTOR: You and your cargo.<br>
RASSMUSSEN: (nods) I got it in here while you were all distracted. <br>
(He opens another bulkhead door to reveal the closed Morpheus pod that
had been gliding through the station.)<br>
CLARA: What's in there? Dust?<br>
DOCTOR: It's like smuggling a jam jar full of germs through customs. <br>
RASSMUSSEN: No. No, &nbsp;more than that.<br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean?<br>
RASSMUSSEN: I've been working on Morpheus for a very long time, Doctor.
&nbsp;I had to start somewhere. Morpheus's first client. Patient
Zero. The ultimate Wide-Awake. Inside there is a man who hasn't slept
in five years. <br>
DOCTOR: Or what's left of him. <br>
RASSMUSSEN: He's the well-spring. Once we get to Triton, he will spread
his spores. &nbsp;<br>
CLARA: But you said it was an encoded signal. Something electronic in
the Morpheus process that changed the chemical
reaction in the brain. <br>
RASSMUSSEN: That's how it started, yes, but it's changing all the time.
Evolving new ways to infect, to flourish. Whole moons, whole planets,
whole civilisations. They'll spread everywhere.<br>
DOCTOR: You know I can't allow that.<br>
RASSMUSSEN: You can't stop them. None of us can.
<br>
(Nagata aims her weapon at Rassmussen.)<br>
NAGATA: I wouldn't bet on that, pet. <br>
(Rassmussen raises his hands, then grabs a lapel. The pod starts to
open. A Sandman sits up and roars. Nagata shoots at it.)<br>
CLARA: Doctor! Doctor!<br>
(Rassmussen runs out, closing the bulkhead door. The Doctor, Clara and
Nagata stay still and whisper.)<br>
DOCTOR: What he wants is to get that thing off this ship. We have to
stop him. <br>
NAGATA: Any ideas? <br>
DOCTOR: The doors are not a problem.<br>
(He puts on his sonic sunglasses.)<br>
NAGATA: But that is.<br>

DOCTOR: We need a distraction.<br>

DOCTOR: Doors! <br>
SINGERS: ♪ Mister Sandman, bring me your

(The doors open and they run into the compartment where Rassmussen is
working the controls. Doors close again.)<br>
DOCTOR: Rassmussen! Turn off the engines. Shut this ship down! <br>
RASSMUSSEN: I can't do that, I'm afraid, Doctor. We can't fight the
inevitable. Humanity's day is done. <br>
NAGATA: Yeah? Well, Humanity might have something to say about that,
pet. <br>
(Nagata shoots Rassmussen, who falls back into a chair.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Argh! <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
CLARA: Is that your answer for everything?<br>
NAGATA: Did you have a better one? <br>
DOCTOR: He's not the only one dead. According to this data, we're the
only ones left alive on this station.

CLARA: Doctor.<br>
NAGATA: Come on, man. We've got to go!<br>

DOCTOR: This doesn't make any sense. <br>
CLARA: What?<br>
DOCTOR: A man who hasn't slept for five years?<br>
CLARA: Well, you heard what he said. That's the first Morpheus patient.<br>
DOCTOR: But the dust consumes the host.<br>
CLARA: And then they make Sandmen. They conglomerate. <br>
DOCTOR: We escaped from that cold storage room because they were blind.
&nbsp;And why power down the grav-shields when he did?
&nbsp;It's like this is all for effect.<br>
CLARA: Look, can we maybe have this conversation when we get off this

(Sandmen move between them and the Tardis. More approach from behind.)<br>
DOCTOR: Nagata!<br>
(He turns Nagata round and uses her helmet schematic projector on a
copper sheet.)<br>
CLARA: Doctor, quickly!<br>
(The Doctor taps the projection of the anti-grav shield generators.)<br>
NAGATA: What did you just do? <br =""="">
DOCTOR: Self-destructed the grav-shields. <br>
NAGATA: What? <br>
(The spacestation tilts. The women cry out.)<br>
DOCTOR: It's working!<br>
(Clara uses her key to open the Tardis door. The Sandmen are
stationary, falling to pieces.)<br>
DOCTOR: Neptune's gravity is pulling them apart, bit by bit! It doesn't
make sense. None of this makes any sense.<br>
(They run inside the Tardis and it dematerialises.)<br>
<br>
(The station is shaking as Rassmussen pops up on our screen. We now
know these messages have been compiled in the rescue ship.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN: Hello again! Thing is, you see, this message, this
testament, it wasn't just my
alibi. It was my plan.
There are no spores, no infection. The Morpheus process remains the
same. An electronic signal that affects the sleep centres of the brain.
Changes them. An electronic signal that's contained in this recording.
(static flicker.) There it is. Tickles, doesn't it? I've just got time
to fit this bit in
and then I can finish the story, and then I'm going to transmit this
footage to the whole Solar System. I do
hope you've enjoyed the show. I did try to make it exciting. All those
scary bits. All those death-defying scrapes, monsters, and a proper
climax with a really big one at the end! Compulsive viewing. I did tell
you not to watch.<br>
(Rassmussen rubs his eye. Dust falls out, leaving a hole in his head.)<br>
RASSMUSSEN: (deeper slower voice) There's nothing left of Rassmussen
any more. Only us.
Only us. You will show this film to your family, won't you?
And your friends. And everyone, really. Then we can all be together,
dust to dust. Excuse me, you've got something there, just in the corner
of your eye.<br>
(Rassmussen's head falls to dust as he points to the top left corner of
the screen. He laughs as he crumbles to pieces, then the cathode ray
screen goes black, with just a small fading dot of
light in the centre.)
