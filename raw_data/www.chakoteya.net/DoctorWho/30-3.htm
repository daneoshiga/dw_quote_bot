takes up the entire wall opposite the desk. It features the Ood, those
creatures with tentacles for mouths from Impossible Planet, who speak
through a globe they hold in their hand.) <br>
NARRATOR [OC]: The Ood. They came from distant world. They voyaged
across the stars, all with one purpose. <br>
OOD: Do you take milk and sugar? <br>
NARRATOR [OC]: To serve. <br>
BARTLE: That's good. That's excellent. I like it, sir. Buy one now.
Direct. Straight to the point. <br>
(He is speaking into his wrist-comm.) <br>
HALPEN [OC]: We play that across the Tri-galactic for two weeks, then
introduce this. <br>
NARRATOR [OC]: Now only fifty credits. <br>
BARTLE: Fifty? We're reducing the price to fifty credits? <br>
HALPEN [OC]: Sales are down. We've got to reposition ourselves. So get
going. <br>
(Communication ends.) <br>
BARTLE: Idiot. Bleeding us dry. You, there. Get me last month's
military export figures. The army always need more grunts. <br>
OOD: Yes, sir. <br>
(A woman's voice comes over the intercom. She has a slight Indian
accent.) <br>
SOLANA [OC]: Mister Bartle, you asked me to call you? <br>
BARTLE: Solana, when those buyers arrive we're going to pitch like
never before. I want those Ood flying out of here. <br>
(The Ood hands him a folder.) <br>
BARTLE: That. I said military figures. That's the domestic files. Get
me the military. <br>
(The Ood slams the file on the desk. Its eyes are glowing red.) <br>
OOD: The file is irrelevant, sir. <br>
BARTLE: Oh? And why's that? <br>
(The Ood zaps him with its globe.) <br>
OOD: Have a nice day.

The Doctor stops it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Set the controls to random. Mystery tour. Outside that door
could be any planet, anywhere, anywhen in the whole wide u. Are you all
right? <br>
DONNA: Terrified. I mean, history's one thing but an alien planet? <br>
DOCTOR: I could always take you home. <br>
DONNA: Yeah, don't laugh at me. <br>
DOCTOR: I know what it's like. Everything you're feeling right now. The
fear, the joy, the wonder? I get that. <br>
DONNA: Seriously? After all this time? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Why do you think I keep going? <br>
DONNA: Oh. All right then, you and me both. This is barmy. I was born
in Chiswick. I've only ever had package holidays. Now I'm here. This is
so. I mean it's. I don't know, it's all sort of. I don't even know what
the word is. </font></p>

DONNA: Oh, I've got the word. Freezing. <br>
DOCTOR: Snow! Oh, real snow. Proper snow at last. That's more like it.
Lovely. What do you think? <br>
DONNA: Bit cold. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at that view. <br>
(Massive icicles hang from bridges of rock over vast ravines.) <br>
DONNA: Yep. Beautiful, cold view. <br>
DOCTOR: Millions of planets, millions of galaxies, and we're on this
one. Molto bene. Bellissimo, says Donna, born in Chiswick. All you've
got is a life of work and sleep, and telly and rent and tax and
takeaway dinners, all birthdays and Christmases and two weeks holiday a
year, and then you end up here. Donna Noble, citizen of the Earth,
standing on a different planet. How about that Donna? <br>
(Donna has disappeared.) <br>
DOCTOR: Donna? <br>
(Donna comes out of the Tardis in a big fur coat with a hood.) <br>
DONNA: Sorry, you were saying? <br>
DOCTOR: Better? <br>
DONNA: Lovely, thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: Comfy? <br>
DONNA: Yep. <br>
DOCTOR: Can you hear anything inside that? <br>
DONNA: Pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: All right, I was saying, citizen of the Earth <br>
(A space rocket glides slowly above them.) <br>
DONNA: Rocket. Blimey, a real proper rocket. Now that's what I call a
spaceship. You've got a box, he's got a Ferrari. Come on, lets go see
where he's going.

in a white coat.) <br>
RYDER: Mister Halpen, sir. Doctor Ryder, new head of Ood Management. <br>
HALPEN: How many dead? Come on, facts and figures. I haven't flown all
this way to discuss the weather, which by the way is freezing. <br>
RYDER: Solana has the figures, sir. <br>
SOLANA: Solana Mercurio, sir. Head of Marketing and Galactic Liaison. <br>
HALPEN: That's just what I need. A PR woman. I don't want a word of
this getting out, is that understood? Now, get to the point. How many
dead? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Office]</b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOLANA: In the past financial quarter we've had
three deaths in the complex, all attributed to heart attacks or
industrial accidents. But now we've captured this on tape, the cause
would seem the same. <br>
(We hear Bartle's scream as his Ood kills him.) <br>
HALPEN: It's using the translator ball as a weapon. How's that work? <br>
RYDER: Well, no idea. I'm checking the equipment. Nothing so far. <br>
HALPEN: Can't see its eyes from this angle. <br>
RYDER: I think we have to assume <br>
HALPEN: Red eye. <br>
RYDER: I would think so, sir. <br>
HALPEN: That Ood. What happened to it? <br>
RYDER: Oh, ran for the wild, sir, like a dog. One of the guards fired
off a shot. It'll be dead by now. <br>
SOLANA: Can I ask? What's red eye, sir? <br>
RYDER: Well, it's some sort of infection. The Ood eyes literally change
colour. <br>
HALPEN: Drink. <br>
(An Ood moves to obey.) <br>
RYDER: I can't find a source. All the bacterial scans register
negative. <br>
SOLANA: Sorry, but according to your own rules, sir, there's no alcohol
allowed on base. <br>
(The Ood hands Halpen a small glass.) <br>
HALPEN: It's hair tonic, if you must know. Five years ago I had a full
head of hair. Stress, that's what this is. Stress.

DOCTOR: Hold on, can you hear that? Donna, take your hood down. <br>
DONNA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: That noise is like a song. Over there. <br>
(An Ood lies on the ground, partly covered in snow.) <br>
DONNA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: An Ood. He's called an Ood. <br>
DONNA: But it's face. <br>
DOCTOR: Donna, don't. Not now. It's a he, not an it. Give me a hand. <br>
DONNA: Sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know where the heart is. I don't know if he's got a
heart. Talk to him, keep him going. <br>
DONNA: It's all right, we've got you. Er, what's your name? <br>
DELTA 50: Designated Ood Delta 50. <br>
(Donna speaks into his translator ball.) <br>
DONNA: My name's Donna. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no. You don't need to. <br>
DONNA: Sorry. Oh, God. This is the Doctor. Just what you need, a
doctor. Couldn't be better, hey? <br>
DOCTOR: You've been shot. <br>
DELTA 50: The circle. <br>
DONNA: No, don't try to talk. <br>
DELTA 50: The circle must be broken. <br>
DOCTOR: Circle? What do you mean? Delta 50, what circle? Delta 50? What
circle? <br>
(Delta 50 sits up with a roar, and red eyes, then exhales and falls
back dead). <br>
DONNA: He's gone. <br>
DOCTOR: Careful. <br>
DONNA: There you are, sweetheart. We were too late. What do we do, do
we bury him? <br>
DOCTOR: The snow'll take care of that. <br>
DONNA: Who was he? What's an Ood? <br>
DOCTOR: They're servants of humans in the forty second century. Mildly
telepathic. That was the song. It was his mind calling out. <br>
DONNA: I couldn't hear anything. He sang as he was dying. <br>
DOCTOR: His eyes turned red. <br>
DONNA: What's that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Trouble. Come on. The Ood are harmless. They're completely
benign. Except, the last time I met them, there was this force, like a
stronger mind, powerful enough to take them over. <br>
DONNA: What sort of force? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, long story. <br>
DONNA: Long walk. <br>
DOCTOR: It was the Devil. <br>
DONNA: If you're going to take the mickey, I'll just put my hood back
up. <br>
DOCTOR: Must be something different this time, though. Something closer
to home. Ah ha! Civilisation.

like to follow me. <br>

DONNA: Representing the Noble Corporation PLC Limited, Intergalactic. <br>

from Ood Operations. We've introduced a variety package with the Ood
translator ball. You can now have the standard setting. How are you
today, Ood? <br>
OOD 1: I'm perfectly well, thank you. <br>
SOLANA: Or perhaps after a stressful day, a little something for the
gentlemen. And how are you, Ood? <br>
OOD 2: (husky female) All the better for seeing you. <br>
SOLANA: And the comedy classic option. Ood, you dropped something. <br>
OOD 3: (Homer Simpson) D'oh. <br>
SOLANA: All that for only five additional credits. The details are in
your brochures. Now, there's plenty more food and drink, so don't hold
back.<br>

access to light up the big screen.) <br>

before. Years ago. Ages. Close to the planet Sense Sphere. Let's widen
out. The year 4126. That is the Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire.<br>

DOCTOR: It's good, isn't it? <br>
DONNA: What's the Earth like now? <br>
DOCTOR: Bit full. But you see, the Empire stretches out across three
galaxies. <br>
DONNA: It's weird. I mean, it's brilliant, but. Back home, the papers
and the telly, they keep saying we haven't got long to live. Global
warming, flooding, all the bees disappearing. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. That thing about the bees is odd. <br>
DONNA: But look at us. We're everywhere. Is that good or bad, though? I
mean, are we like explorers? Or more like a virus? <br>
DOCTOR: Sometimes I wonder. <br>

DOCTOR: Ood distribution centres. <br>

OOD 1: I do not understand, Miss. <br>
DONNA: Why do you say Miss? Do I look single? <br>
DOCTOR: Back to the point. <br>
DONNA: Yeah. What I mean is, are there any free Ood? Are there Ood
running wild somewhere, like wildebeest. <br>
OOD 1: All Ood are born to serve. Otherwise, we would die. <br>
DONNA: But you can't have started like that. Before the humans, what
were you like? <br>

SIGMA: Humanity defines us, sir. We look to you for answers. <br>
HALPEN: Oh, fat lot of good, all of you. We're exporting hundreds of
thousands of Ood to all the civilised planets. If they turn rabid, you
know what it'll mean. <br>

Fifteen. <br>
HALPEN: Why should that cause trouble? It's been two centuries now. No
change, not ever. Drink. <br>

I should see it. Just in case. <br>

DOCTOR: It's a brain. A hind brain. The Ood are born with a secondary
brain. Like the amygdala in humans, it processes memory and emotions.
You get rid of that, you wouldn't be Donna any more. You'd be like an
