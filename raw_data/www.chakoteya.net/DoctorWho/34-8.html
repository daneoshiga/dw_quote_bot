of the number 66, an incandescent light bulb fickers, then a
traditional horror film mummy is roaring and reaching for us -)<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Start the clock.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Restaurant coach]</b><br>
<br>
(The numbers count down near the bottom of the screen. A young
woman in traditional black and white maids uniform walks down the
central aisle of a steam train's restaurant coach. It is the 1920s, and
the whistle
blows. At 52 seconds, an old woman looks up, then lowers her lorgnette
and
speaks to the fashionable young lady opposite.)<br>
MRS PITT: Is there some sort of fancy dress thing on this evening?
<br>
MAISIE: I don't think so. Why do you ask?
<br>
MRS PITT: Well, that fellow over there, dressed as a mummy monster
thing.
<br>
MAISIE: Who do you mean? I can't see him.
<br>
(The mummy reaches for Mrs Pitt. She summons the head waiter.)<br>
MRS PITT:&nbsp;You! You! Throw that man out of my dining car. It's
disgusting.
<br>
WAITER: I'm sorry, Madam. Which man?
<br>
MRS PITT: Which man?! I'll have your job. That man, right there,
dressed as a monster.
<br>
(The head waiter walks away.)<br>
MAISIE: Mama, there isn't anyone there. Are you feeling okay?
<br>
MRS PITT: Don't you dare lie to me, girl. I won't be made a fool of.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop him at once. Right now.
<br>
MAISIE: Mama, there's no one there. You're worrying me. Do you want one
of your pills?
<br>
MRS PITT: Oh, no! Get it off! Get it off!
<br>
(Zero. The mummy puts its hands Mrs Pitt's head and she goes limp.
Maisie stands up.)<br>
MAISIE: Oh! Is there a doctor? Sorry, I need a doctor. Sorry, I don't
know. She just, she just stopped.
<br>
(A man comes over to check on Mrs Pitt as the steam whistle blows. The
camera moves back through the window to show us the name of
the&nbsp;train - Orient Express - as it hurtles on through space.) <br>
<br>
<b>[Baggage car]<br>
<br>
</b>(The
Tardis materialises in a space at the back of the car, amidst racks of
suitcases, and the Doctor steps out
wearing a black suit with a white handkerchief in the breast pocket and
a loose bow tie with very long ends, sort of Western style. He
holds out his hand to his companion, a fashionable flapper with
jaw-length bobbed hair.)<br>
DOCTOR: Your train awaits, my lady.
<br>
CLARA: Wonderful.
<br>
DOCTOR: The baggage car. But thanks for lying. The real wonderful is
through here.
<br>
(The train's bell rings. Music is coming from nearby.)<br>
DOCTOR: There were many trains to take the name Orient Express, but
only one in space.<br>
<br>
<b>[Lounge]<br>
<br>
</b>(Comfortable chairs down the side of the carriage, a
bar at one end, and armed men standing guard. The band is playing a
slow jazz version of&nbsp;Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The singer is
a young lady called Foxes, so that's what I'll call her instead of just
Singer.)<br>
CLARA: Of course it is. <br>
FOXES: (sings) So don't stop me now.<br>
DOCTOR: Completely faithful recreation of the original Orient
Express. Except slightly bigger. And in space. Oh, and the rails are
actually hyperspace ribbons. But in every other respect, identical.
Painstaking attention to detail.
<br>
(A man with a bald head, big red beard and steampunk eyepatch barges in
between them.)<br>
FOXES: (sings) I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars <br>
DOCTOR: Most of the time.
<br>
(The Doctor rubs his bruised arm.)<br>
FOXES: (sings) On a collision course I am a satellite, I'm out of
control. I'm a sex machine ready to reload. Like an atom bomb about
to oh, oh, oh <br>
DOCTOR: You're doing it again.
<br>
CLARA: Doing what?
<br>
DOCTOR: The smile.
<br>
CLARA: Yeah, I'm smiling.
<br>
DOCTOR: It's the sad smile. It's a smile but you're sad. It's
confusing. It's like two emotions at once. It's like you're
malfunctioning.
<br>
CLARA: Sorry.
<br>
FOXES: (sings) Travelling at the speed of light. Wanna make a
supersonic woman of you.<br>
DOCTOR: I just thought this would be a good one to <br>
CLARA: To end it. Yeah. It is. It's a good choice. A good one to end
on.
<br>
DOCTOR: Yeah?
<br>
CLARA: Mmm hmm.
<br>
DOCTOR: Shall we?
<br>
(The maid approaches with a tray of champagne flutes. The Doctor offers
Clara his arm.)<br>
CLARA: Mmm hmm,.
<br>
FOXES: (sings) Gimme a call. Don't stop me now Don't stop me. <br>
(An indicator changes from a monocle to a thumbs up with a ting! The
onboard computer speaks.) <br>
GUS: Ladies and gentlemen. If you would be good enough to look from
the windows on the right of the train, you'll be able to see the
soaring majesty of the Magellan black hole.
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I remember when this was all planets as far as the eye
could see. All gone now. Gobbled up by that beast. And there's that
smile again. I don't even know how you do that.
CLARA: I really thought I hated you, you know?
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, thank God you kept that to yourself. There was this
planet, Obsidian. The planet of perpetual darkness.
<br>
CLARA: I did. I did hate you. In fact, I hated you for weeks.
<br>
DOCTOR: Good, fine. Well, I'm glad that we cleared that up. There was
also a planet that was made completely of shrubs.
<br>
CLARA: I went to a concert once. Can't remember who it was. But do you
know what the singer said?
<br>
DOCTOR: Frankly, that would be an absolutely astonishing guess if I did
know.
<br>
CLARA: She said, "hatred is too strong an emotion to waste on someone
that you don't like." <br>
(I thought that was a Sixto Rodriguez quote, but don't mind me.)<br>
DOCTOR: Were people really confused? Cos I'm confused. Did everybody
leave?
<br>
CLARA: Shush. Shut up. Look, what I'm trying to say is, I
don't hate you. I could never hate you. But I can't do this any
more. Not the way you do it.
<br>
DOCTOR: Can I talk about the planets now?
<br>
CLARA: Yes. Go.
<br>
DOCTOR: Thedion Four. Constant acid rain. Had a lovely picnic there
once, wearing a gas mask.
<br>
MAISIE: That's a lie.
<br>
CLARA: I'm sorry?
<br>
MAISIE: That's a lie, what you said. Thedion Four was destroyed
thousands of years ago, so you couldn't have been there.
<br>
(The chief train guard comes over. He wears a uniform with two medals,
lots of gold frogging and has a gun in a holster.)<br>
QUELL: Miss Pitt, are you sure you wouldn't rather rest in your room?
<br>
MAISIE: That man's a liar.
<br>
QUELL: Perhaps you'd allow Mister Carlyle here to escort you back.
<br>
(Another uniformed guard.)<br>
CARLYLE: It'll be all right, miss. Just come with me.
<br>
QUELL: Sorry about that. I suppose it's understandable in the
circumstances. I don't believe we've been introduced. Captain Quell.
<br>
CLARA: I'm Clara. This is the Doctor.
<br>
QUELL: Ah, another one.
<br>
CLARA: Sorry? Another what?
<br>
QUELL: Well, we've got doctors and professors coming out of our ears on
this trip. So, what are you a doctor of?
<br>
DOCTOR: Now, there's a question that's never asked often enough. Let's
say intestinal parasites.
<br>
QUELL: I'm beginning to think Miss Pitt was right about you.
<br>
CLARA: What's wrong with her? Did something happen?
<br>
QUELL: You mean you really don't know?
<br>
<br>
<b>[Corridor]</b><br>
<br>
(They take their champagne out into the corridor to talk.)<br>
CLARA: There's a body <i>and</i> there's a mummy. I mean,
can you not just
get on a train? Did a wizard put a curse on you about mini-breaks?
<br>
DOCTOR: It might be nothing. Old ladies die all the time. It's
practically
their job description.
<br>
CLARA: And the monster?
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, seen by no one except her, which suggests that it
wasn't there. A dying brain, lack of oxygen, hallucinations. Anyway,
people do just die sometimes. She was over a hundred years old.
<br>
CLARA: Says the two thousand year old man.
<br>
DOCTOR: Clara, you actually sound as if you want this to <i>be</i>&nbsp;a
thing. Do you?
<br>
CLARA: No. No, look, fine. You know,&nbsp;if you think that there
is nothing to worry about, then that is fine by me.
<br>
DOCTOR: Are you sure?
<br>
CLARA: Ah, yes, I'm sure.
<br>
DOCTOR: To our last hurrah.
<br>
CLARA: Our last, yeah. I mean, it's not like I'm never going to see you
again.
<br>
DOCTOR: Isn't it?
<br>
CLARA: Is it?
<br>
DOCTOR: I thought that's what you wanted.
<br>
CLARA: No, what I mean, you're going to come round for dinner or
something, aren't you? Do you, do you do that? Do you come round to
people's
houses for dinner?<br>
DOCTOR: Of course. Why wouldn't I do that?
<br>
CLARA: I don't know. I thought you might find it boring.
<br>
DOCTOR: Is it boring?
<br>
CLARA: No.
<br>
(She raises her champagne flute.)<br>
CLARA: To the last hurrah.
<br>
DOCTOR: The last hurrah.
<br>
(Clink.)<br>

<b>[Doctor's sleeping compartment]<br>
<br>
</b>(The Doctor is lying down on his bed. He flexes his
fingers and argues with himself.)<br>
DOCTOR:
It's nothing. Nothing. Definitely. Sure. Ninety nine percent sure.
Really? Ninety nine percent? That's quite high. Is that the figure
you're sticking with? Okay, okay. Seventy five. Well, that's jumped
quite a bit. You've just lost twenty four percent.<br>
<br>
<b>[Clara's sleeping compartment]<br>
<br>
</b>(Clara is in her room, in silk pajamas and making a
phone call.)
<br>
DANNY [OC]: A train in space? Sounds pretty cool.
<br>
CLARA: So, what are you saying? Just because he brought me somewhere
cool, I shouldn't dump him?
<br>
<br>
<b>[Danny's flat]<br>
<br>
</b>(He's ready for bed, too.)<br>
DANNY: Well, one, you can't dump him because he's not your
boyfriend. <br>
<br>
<b>[Clara's sleeping compartment]<br>
<br>
</b>DANNY [OC]: And two, dumping him sounds a little
scorched
earth. <br>
<br>
<b>[Danny's flat]</b><br>
<br>
DANNY: You still basically get on. <br>
<br>
<b>[Clara's sleeping compartment]<br>
<br>

<br>
</b>DANNY: Train.&nbsp;At least it's not dangerous.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Clara's sleeping compartment]</b><br>
<br>
CLARA:&nbsp;Yeah. It's pretty&nbsp;boring, really.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Doctor's sleeping compartment]<br>
<br>
</b>DOCTOR: Because you know what this sounds like, don't
you? No, do
tell me. A mummy that only the victim can see. I was being rhetorical.
I know exactly what this sounds like.
<br>
(</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He puts on his jacket and goes out into the
corridor. )</font><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
<b>[Corridor]<br>
<br>
</b>(The Doctor hesitates outside Clara's door, nearly
knocks,&nbsp;then walks on. Clara comes out and knocks on the
Doctor's door.)<br>
CLARA (whispering): Doctor, are you awake?
<br>
<br>
<b>[Engineer's carriage]</b><br>
<br>
(Computer screens above a workbench, blueprints on a draughting table.
Racks of tools. The Doctor finds a piece of
equipment bubbling to itself, and apparently powering up according to
the display. He removes the plastic wrapping and scans
it with the screwdriver. The Chief Engineer startles him.)<br>
PERKINS: Beautiful bit of kit, isn't it, sir? The Excelsior Life
Extender. It's like driving around in a portable hospital.
<br>
(Perkins is holding a heavy piece of metal.)<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it didn't do Mrs Pitt much good, did it?
<br>
PERKINS: Got me there, sir. Certainly got me there. Maybe it
malfunctioned.
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. The records show that the machine did
everything it could to keep her alive.
<br>
PERKINS: Yeah. And almost drained the battery doing it.
<br>
DOCTOR: What do you know?
<br>
PERKINS: Well, I know that when I find a man fiddling with a chair
that someone died in, it's best to play my cards close to my chest.
<br>
DOCTOR: Really? Well, I know that when I find a man loitering near a
chair that someone died in, I do just the same.
<br>
PERKINS: Perkins. Chief Engineer.
<br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor. Nosey Parker.
<br>
PERKINS: (chuckles) Pleased to meet you, Doctor. <br>
(They shake hands.) <br>
PERKINS: Course, there's a rumour that someone&nbsp;or some <i>thing</i>
else might be responsible.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Corridor]<br>
<br>
</b>(Clara has got dressed and come
out of her sleeping compartment again. She meets Maisie walking along
in her pajamas and
holding her right shoe in her hand, and follows her.)<br>
CLARA: Hello?&nbsp;Are you okay? Hello? Excuse me? Excuse me? <br>
<br>
<b>[Baggage car]<br>
<br>
</b>CLARA: Miss Pitt, wasn't it? Are you all right? Do you
need some help?
<br>
MAISIE: My name's Maisie. I'm not mad.
<br>
CLARA: Oh, okay. Er, I didn't say you were, but you've had a bad
day. I think anybody could do with a little bit of help after a day
like today.<br>
(Maisie addresses the panel next to a heavy door at the end of the
baggage car. It is labelled Private Company Property)
<br>
MAISIE: Computer, open the door.
<br>
GUS: Call me Gus. I'm afraid this door can only be opened by executive
order.
<br>
(The thumbs down icon makes a sad noise.)<br>
CLARA: Are you okay?
<br>
(Maisie cries as she tries pressing buttons on the keypad.)<br>
MAISIE: They won't let me see her body. They should let me see her
body, shouldn't they?
<br>
CLARA: Er, yeah, I should think so. It's in there, is it? Okay,
I have a friend who's really good with locks. Do you want to come with
me, see if we can find him?
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
MAISIE: Oh!
</font><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Maisie
slams the heel of her shoe into the door key pad and shorts it out. The
icon changes to a telescope on a tripod, then the thumbs down, then
cannot make up its mind. The door opens.)</font><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA:
Or you could do that because that works, too.
<br>
(Clara follows Maisie into the room and the door closes behind them.)<br>
<br>
<b>[Lounge]<br>
<br>
</b>(The Doctor walks up to a man&nbsp;with a thin
moustache who is reading a book, and points at him.)<br>
DOCTOR: What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold?
<br>
MOORHOUSE: I'm terribly sorry, I don't believe we've met.
<br>
DOCTOR: You know. The Foretold. Mythical mummy. Legend has it that if
you see it, you're a dead man.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Yes, I know what it is. You see, I happen to be <br>
DOCTOR: Emil Moorhouse, professor of alien mythology. I'm the
Doctor. Pleased to meet you. So, the most interesting thing about the
Foretold. Go.
<br>
(The Doctor sits down on the other side of Moorhouse's small table.)<br>
MOORHOUSE: Er, well, it would have to be the time limit given
before it kills you. I can't think of another myth where it's so
specific.
How does it go? Er, The number of evil twice over. They that
bear the Foretold's stare&nbsp;have sixty six seconds to live.
<br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Nice try. Very atmospheric. But that's not it. Try
again.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: A cynical man might say that you were trying to pump me for
information.
<br>
DOCTOR: The myth of the Foretold first appeared over five thousand
years
ago. In some stories, there is a riddle or secret word that is supposed
to make it stop. Some characters try to bargain with it, offer riches,
confess sins. All to no avail.
<br>
(The Doctor opens the silver cigarette case he has taken from his
jacket pocket and offers the Professor a
jelly baby.)<br>
MOORHOUSE: Well, you certainly know a little mythology.
<br>
DOCTOR: I know a lot. Because, from time to time, it turns out to be
true.

field, to be honest. Hoping one day I might meet a real monster.

DOCTOR: Isn't that everyone's dream? But you still haven't answered
my riddle. What's the most interesting thing about the Foretold?
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Well, you can't run from it, that's for sure. There are
accounts of people trying, but it never works. No matter how far you

high-heeled shoe.
<br>
MAISIE: Do you ever wish bad things on people?
<br>
CLARA: Oh, yeah. All the time. Whoever designed this door, for a start.
<br>
MAISIE: She wasn't really my mum. She just made me call her that. She
was my gran. Do you know why I wanted to see her body?
<br>
CLARA: Because you loved her very much and were missing her?
<br>
MAISIE: (chuckles) No. You obviously never met her. No, I just
felt really guilty. Like I'd been picturing her dying for years. Like a
daydream. Not really meaning it. At least, I don't think I did. But
now, it just feels like I made this happen.
<br>
(Clara abandons the lock.)<br>
CLARA: Hey, listen. You didn't do anything wrong. Difficult
people, they can make you feel&nbsp;all sorts of things. But you
didn't do it. You didn't kill her. She just died.

DOCTOR: Come on, Captain. Where would we all be if we all followed
our job descriptions, hmm? Good question. Glad you asked. In your case,
you'd be doing something instead of climbing inside a bottle.
<br>
QUELL: I have followed the procedure for accidental death to the
letter.

DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you have. And I'm sure you do just enough of your
job to avoid complaints.

QUELL: You don't know anything about me.
<br>
DOCTOR: Wounded in battle, honourable discharge. And this is just a
guess, but I think you've had the fight knocked out of you. You
expected this to be a cushy desk job where you could put your head down
until retirement. Well, I'm sorry. As of today, that dream is over.
<br>
QUELL: There is no evidence of any attack or other parties <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, let's just sit around and wait for the evidence while
the bodies pile up. Or here's a crazy thought. We could do something
to stop it. Why am I even talking to you?

CLARA: It's true. It is. It's very true.

MAISIE: You do seem to be here together.
<br>
CLARA: Seriously? We're stuck in this carriage, probably all night, and
all we can talk about is some man?
<br>
MAISIE: Some man?
<br>
CLARA: Not that kind of. Look, we, er, we knocked about
together, we travelled and now we're stopping. This is a, I don't
know, goodbye to the good times?
<br>

recorded by CCTV, while Moorhouse and Perkins look on.)<br>
MRS PITT [on screen]:&nbsp;No! No! Get it out! Argh!<br>
DOCTOR: Sixty six seconds. It fits the myth. Did you see the lights
flicker?
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Mmm.
<br>
PERKINS: Yeah, the lights went in the kitchen as well just before the
chef saw it.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: In all of the accounts, conventional weapons have no
effect on the Foretold. It's immortal, unstoppable, unkillable.

CLARA: Yes. Yes. Yes, he was.
<br>
MAISIE: And, and high-handed and, and thoughtless and, and, and
arrogant beyond belief.
<br>
CLARA: Exactly.
<br>
MAISIE: And you got on a train with him.
<br>
CLARA: I was saying goodbye. You can't end it on a slammed door.

MAISIE: Yes, you can. Anyone can do it. People do it all the time.
Except, of course, when they can't.

(In the Engineer's room, Moorhouse is sleeping in a chair, and Perkins
is
slumped at his desk. The Doctor is looking through papers when there is
a
beeping sound and the blinds are raised. It must be morning, train
time. He takes the intercom phone off the wall and sonicks it,
disconnects its cord from of the wall then calls
Clara.)<br>

(His shots break glasses on tables. Nine seconds.)<br>
QUELL: What do you think you're doing, man?
<br>
GUARD: Please, please! Stop! No <br>
QUELL: Get up, man. That's an order!
<br>
(The mummy holds the guard's head, then he falls back. The doctor in
the white coat and Edward
VII beard checks for a pulse and shakes his head. Moorhouse give Quell
the guard's gun. He hands it off to another guard.)<br>
QUELL: It turns out it's three. The amount of people that had to die
before I stopped looking the other way.
<br>
(The Doctor is released.)<br>
DOCTOR: Thank you.
<br>
PERKINS: Same as the others?
<br>
(He has appeared suddenly and silently at the Doctor's elbow.)<br>
GUARD: Excuse me please.
Take his feet. Excuse me please.<br>
(The other guards carry their late colleague away.)<br>
DOCTOR: Ladies and gentlemen, could I have a moment of your time,
please? There's a monster on this train that can only be seen by those
about to die. If you <i>do</i> see it, you will have
exactly sixty six seconds left
in which to live. But that isn't even the strangest thing. Do you know
what is? You. The passengers. Experts in alien biology, mythology,
physics. If I was putting together a team to analyse this thing, I'd
pick you. And I think somebody has. Someone of immense power and
influence has orchestrated this whole trip. Someone who I have no doubt
is listening to us right now.&nbsp;So, are you going to step out
from behind the curtain and give us our orders?
<br>
PERKINS: The engines. They've stopped.
<br>
(In a flurry of electronic activity, the 1920s railway carriage decor
is replaced by a high-tech laboratory.)<br>
DOCTOR: And the facade drops away because what use are a bunch of
scientists without a lab?
<br>
(A large number of people disappear. One of those remaining looks
remarkably like Albert Einstein.)<br>
PERKINS: Teleporter?
<br>
DOCTOR: No. Hard light holograms. They were never really here. Fake
passengers to make up the numbers.
<br>
(Hard light? Red Dwarf!)<br>
QUELL: That was my best guard.
<br>
(Ting! The thumbs up icon on a monitor is replaced by a monocle.)
<br>
GUS: Good morning, everyone. Around the room you will find a
variety of scientific equipment. Your goal is to ascertain the
Foretold's true nature, probe for weaknesses with a view to capture,
after which we will reverse engineer its abilities. Isn't this
exciting?
<br>
DOCTOR: You said&nbsp;capture, implying that you can't control this
thing. And yet somehow you got it on board. How?
<br>
GUS: There is an artefact, an ancient scroll. I have
highlighted it for your convenience. For reasons currently unknown, the
Foretold appears in the vicinity of this artefact.<br>
(A
small spotlight turns to illuminate the scroll&nbsp;on the door at
the
end of the car. It has&nbsp;cuneiform writing on it, which is
interesting as that is really marks made in moist clay, not painted on
papyrus or fabric.)<br>
DOCTOR: And kills at regular intervals.
<br>
QUELL: Then just maybe we should throw this thing out in the airlock.
<br>
DOCTOR: No! No! No!
<br>
(Quell gets an electric shock when he tries to touch the scroll.)<br>
PERKINS: Looks like they've thought of that.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: What if we say no? Down tools. Refuse to work.
<br>
GUS: That <i>is</i> your choice, of course. But it would
be very upsetting were you all to die at the hands of the Foretold.
<br>
PERKINS: So hurry up, before it kills you.
<br>
DOCTOR: But even if they agree to this, how are they supposed to
study a creature that they can't even see? We don't even know what the
species is. <br>
(The light flickers.)<br>
DOCTOR: Perkins, start the clock.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Approximately one point eight metres tall. Actually, seeing
it in
the flesh isn't nearly as rewarding as I thought it might be.
<br>
(The mummy drags its left foot as it approaches.)<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Hard cheese. What can you see? Details.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Yes. Yes, of course, of course. Uh Well, it just looks like
er, a man in bandages. I <br>
DOCTOR: What kind of bandages? Old? New?
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Old.
<br>
DOCTOR: Whole? Ragged?
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Ragged. Falling off in places. I don't know what you want me
to tell you.
<br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me! You can see this thing. We can't. Tell us
what you can see. Even the smallest detail might help save the next
one.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: The next one? You mean you can't save me?
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, that is implied, isn't it? Yes, this is probably the end
for you. But make it count. Details, please.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Er, flesh. Some of it is visible <br>
PERKINS: Thirty seconds.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Er, leathery. Ancient looking. Peat bog preserved.
<br>
DOCTOR: Keep talking. Don't waste this chance.<br>
MOORHOUSE: I want to bargain for my life.
<br>
DOCTOR: W-w-w-what?
<br>
MOORHOUSE: Well, it says, some of the myths say if you,
if you find the right word, if you make the right offer, then it lets
you go.
<br>
DOCTOR: This is not a myth. This is real. Forget your superstitions.
Tell us what you can see.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: This is my life, my death. I'm going to fight for it how I
want. Er, I&nbsp;give you <br>
PERKINS: Ten seconds.
<br>
MOORHOUSE: My soul. I confess all sins. I give you all my worldly
goods. Only, please, please, please. No!

(The mummy holds Moorhouse's head, then he falls.)<br>
PERKINS: Zero.
<br>
GUS: We apologise for any distress you may have just
experienced. Grief counselling is available on request. On the bright
side, I'm sure you've all collected a lot of data. Well done,

PERKINS: It's recording every death.
<br>
DOCTOR: Of course it is. That's why we're here. To study our own
demise. So let's get to work. Come on. Chop, chop.

DOCTOR: Clara, I have to go.
<br>
GUS: I'm sorry. I know that must have been distressing for
you. But if you are disobedient again, I will decompress another area
containing less valuable passengers.<br>
DOCTOR: Less valuable passengers? How does it choose?
<br>
PERKINS: Well, I'm assuming qualifications <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Not the computer, the Foretold. How does it
choose who to kill? We've assumed it's random. What if it's not? I want
full histories on all the victims. Medical, social, personal.
<br>
GUS: Well done.
<br>
DOCTOR: Don't mention it.
<br>
(Later, looking at a tablet computer.)<br>
PERKINS: Doesn't seem to be any pattern. Their travel history,
interests, health. It's all over the shop. Health?
<br>
DOCTOR: Health? Are you sure? Mrs Pitt, the first victim. She was over
a hundred years old. The frailest passenger on board.
<br>
PERKINS: Oh but the next to go, the chef, was young and fit. It's
random.
<br>
QUELL: The chef was ill.
<br>
DOCTOR: What?
<br>
QUELL: A rare blood disorder. Not contagious, but we kept it quiet.
<br>
DOCTOR: Because he worked with food. The next one, the guard?
<br>
QUELL: He wasn't ill as such, but he did have synthetic lungs implanted
last year.
<br>
PERKINS: Professor Moorhouse. It seems he was physically fine but
suffering from, here we are.&nbsp;Regular panic attacks after a car
crash last year.<br>
DOCTOR: It's picking off the weakest first. Sensing the illness
somehow. The fake organs, even psychological issues. But this is good
news,
because it means we can work out who is next. I want the medical
records of everybody alive who is still on board. If anyone's had as
much as a cold, I want to know about it.
<br>
QUELL: You really think it can sense psychological issues?
<br>
DOCTOR: It seems so. Why?
<br>
QUELL: When you said I'd lost the stomach for a fight, I wasn't
wounded in battle as such, but. My unit was bombed. I was the
sole survivor. Not a scratch on me. But post-traumatic stress.
Nightmares. Still can't sleep without pills.
<br>
DOCTOR: Which means that you are probably next. Which is good to know.
<br>
QUELL: Well, not for me.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course not for you, because you're going to die. But I
mean for us, from a research point of view.

DOCTOR: Well, there's goes our head start. Perkins, start the clock.<br>

QUELL: Almost feels out of focus. Gives me a headache just looking at
it.

(Quell draws his service weapon.)<br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. That didn't work before.
<br>
QUELL: What kind of soldier would I be, dying with bullets in my gun?
<br>
(Quell shoots&nbsp;a flask.)<br>
PERKINS: Fifty seconds.
<br>
QUELL: Someone shut that man up! For the record, it didn't even flinch.
<br>
DOCTOR: Where is it now?
<br>
QUELL: Approximately twenty feet in front of me and closing.
<br>
PERKINS: Forty seconds.
<br>
DOCTOR: Am I close?
<br>
(We are treated to the view of the mummy's outstretched fingers coming
out of the Doctor's eyes before the rest of its bandaged hand passes
through his head.)<br>
QUELL: It's passing right through you, like a ghost.

(Perkins is holding out a scanner and reading his tablet.)<br>
PERKINS: It's not a hologram.
<br>
DOCTOR: If you move, will it follow?
<br>
QUELL: Do you want me to move? Because I can certainly do that.
<br>
DOCTOR: Keep looking at it, but back off quick as you like.
<br>
QUELL: It's teleported away.&nbsp;It's behind me.
<br>
PERKINS: Twenty seconds.
<br>
QUELL: I think this is it. Still, suppose it's not a bad way to go.
Blood pumping, enemy at the gates and all that. And thank you, Doctor,
for waking me up. It's reaching for me. Hands on my head.
<br>
PERKINS: Zero.
<br>
QUELL: Ah!
<br>
DOCTOR: Teleporter. That means tech. Then sixty six seconds to do
what? Sixty six seconds. That seems very, very specific. Too specific
for organic.
So, what, more tech? What? More? A countdown clock? Something charging?
<br>
PERKINS: A man just died in front of us. Can we not just have a moment?
<br>
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no. We can't do that. We can't mourn. People
with guns to their heads, they cannot mourn. We do not have time to
mourn. Everybody, what takes sixty six seconds to charge up or to
change
state? Anyone?&nbsp;Am I surrounded by idiots? If only I could see
this thing.<br>
PERKINS: Don't even joke about that.
<br>
DOCTOR: I'm not joking about it. One minute with me and this thing, it
would be over!
<br>
PERKINS: You know, Doctor, I can't tell if you're a genius or just
incredibly arrogant.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, ah, on a good day, I'm both. Ancient tech. This thing
has been around for centuries. How? Tech that keeps it alive. Tech that
drains energy from the living. Scanner. <br>
(He takes Perkin's scanner and uses it on Quell's corpse, then throws
it back to Perkins.)<br>
DOCTOR: Deep tissue scan. He's
been leached of almost all energy on a cellular level. The heart attack
is just a, is just a side effect.
<br>
PERKINS: Oh, it's not just a mummy, it's a vampire. Metaphorically
speaking.
<br>
DOCTOR: But why take sixty six seconds to drain us? Why not just
pounce?
<br>
PERKINS: Phase. Moving energy out of phase. That takes about a minute,
doesn't it?
<br>
DOCTOR: That's why only the victims can see it. It takes them out
of phase so it can drain their energy. You, sir, are a genius! This
explains everything! Apart from what it is and how it's doing it.
Sorry, I jumped the gun there with the&nbsp;you're a genius, that
explains
everything remark.
<br>
PERKINS: Doctor, I think we know the next victim.

DOCTOR: I didn't <i>know</i>. I certainly hoped.
<br>
CLARA: Okay, this. You see, this. This is why I'm leaving you. This.
Because you lied. You lied to me, again. And now you've made me lie.
You've made me your&nbsp;accomplice.
<br>
MAISIE: What? Sorry? When did you lie? Clara?
<br>
CLARA: Maisie, I am, I am so sorry.
<br>
(Maisie points at the mummy as the lights flicker.)<br>
PERKINS: Do we start the clock?
<br>
DOCTOR: Not yet.
<br>
(The Doctor stands in front of Maisie and flashes the scanner in her
face.)<br>
DOCTOR: Focus. Focus. Focus! All of that is your grief, your trauma,
your resentment. And now <br>
(He puts the scanner to his own head and zaps himself.)<br>
DOCTOR: It's mine.
<br>
(The mummy growls and vanishes.)<br>
MAISIE: It's gone.
<br>
DOCTOR: No. No, it's not. Not for me. Cos now it thinks I'm you. <br>
(He throws the scanner onto a table.)<br>
DOCTOR: Start the clock. (to the mummy) Hello.
<br>
(It reaches for him.)<br>
DOCTOR: I'm so pleased to finally see you. I'm the Doctor and I
will be your victim this evening. <a href="27-9.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Are you
my mummy?</a> But you can't
hurt
me until my time is up. I think. So are there magic words? Is there a
way to stop you in your tracks? Oh, you really didn't like your gran,
did you? There's something visible under the bandages. By the way, you
weren't being paranoid. She really did poison your pony.
<br>
MAISIE: Oh!
<br>
DOCTOR: Markings like the ones the scroll. Oh, and your father. Sorry.
<br>
MAISIE: What <br>
DOCTOR: A tattered piece of cloth attached to a length of wood that you
will kill for.
<br>
PERKINS: Thirty seconds.
<br>
DOCTOR: That doesn't sound like a scroll. That sounds like a
flag! And if that sounds like a flag, if this is a flag, that means
that you are a soldier, wounded in a forgotten war thousands of
years ago. But they've worked on you, haven't they, son? They've filled
you full of kit. State of the art phase camouflage, personal
teleporter.
<br>
PERKINS: Ten seconds.
<br>
DOCTOR: And all that tech inside you, it just won't let you die,
will it? It won't let the war end. It just won't let you stop until the
war is over. We surrender.
<br>
PERKINS: Zero.
<br>
MAISIE: (gasps) I can see it again.
<br>
(The mummy steps back from the Doctor and lowers its arms.)<br>
CLARA: It's okay. I think we all can.
<br>
PERKINS: Do I start the clock?
<br>
DOCTOR: No.
<br>
(The mummy salutes the Doctor.)<br>
DOCTOR: The clock has stopped. You're relieved, soldier.
<br>
(The mummy disintegrates into a pile of dust and old bandages.)<br>
PERKINS: Phew. He's not the only one.
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor picks up a piece of blue tech with
wires from the remains.)</font><br>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA:
We were fighting that?
<br>
DOCTOR: So was he.
<br>
CLARA: Listen, what I said <br>
DOCTOR: Save it. We're not out of the woods yet. Well, Gus, I think
we solved your little puzzle. Ancient soldier being driven by
malfunctioning tech.
<br>
GUS: Thank you so much for your efforts. They are greatly
appreciated. Unfortunately, survivors of this exercise are not
required.
<br>
(The Doctor has sonicked the tech, and now gets another tool from a
different table.)<br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, there's a shocker.
<br>
(People clutch their throats, gasping.)<br>
GUS: Air will now be removed from the entire train. We hope you have
enjoyed your journey on the Orient Express.
<br>
CLARA: I take it you know a way out?
<br>
DOCTOR: My enemy's enemy is my friend. Especially when he has a built
in teleporter.
<br>
(Perkins and Maisie pass out.)<br>
CLARA: Great! So use it!
<br>
DOCTOR: A little more work.
<br>
CLARA: Doctor!
<br>
DOCTOR: Couple of minutes. Max. I'll give you a shout.
<br>
(Clara hits the floor with an unlady-like thud. The Orient Express
explodes.)<br>
<br>
<b>[Pebble beach]</b><br>
<br>
(Clara
wakes up wrapped in a blanket and lying on another plaid one. The
Doctor is back in his dark blue suit sans tie and is scratching at the
little visible sand with a stick, doing his Gallefreyan maths.
The sky is pink.)<br>
DOCTOR: Oh hello, again. Sleep well?
<br>
CLARA: Weren't we just on a train?
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that was ages ago.
<br>
CLARA: And?
<br>
DOCTOR: And what? Oh, and we got off the train. Oh, well, the
teleporter worked eventually. Beamed everyone into the Tardis. No
casualties, just a bevy of sleeping beauties. I tried hacking Gus from
the Tardis, find out who set this all up. He really didn't like that.
Set off some fail-safe thing. Blew up the train.
<br>
CLARA: Blew up the train?
<br>
DOCTOR: Blew up the train. But we got away. Then I dropped everyone
off at the nearest civilised planet, which happened to be here. <br>
(View of a&nbsp;city with tall pointed buildings in the
background.)<br>
DOCTOR: You
seemed happy asleep so I just left you.
<br>
CLARA: So you saved everyone.
<br>
DOCTOR: No, I just saved you and I let everyone else suffocate. Ha, ha,
ha. <br>
CLARA: Hmm. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, this is just my cover story.
<br>
CLARA: So, when you lied to Maisie, when you made me lie to Maisie <br>
DOCTOR: I couldn't risk Gus finding out my plan and stopping me.
<br>
CLARA: So you were pretending to be heartless.
<br>
DOCTOR: Would you like to think that about me? Would that make it
easier? I didn't know if I could save her. I couldn't save Quell, I
couldn't save Moorhouse. There was a good chance that she'd die too. At
which point, I would have just&nbsp;moved onto the next, and the
next, until I beat it. Sometimes the only choices you have are
bad ones. But you still have to choose.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]</b><br>
<br>
(Perkins is looking at the workings under the time rotor.)<br>
PERKINS: Er, it's er, quite a vehicle you have here, Doctor.
I won't pretend to understand half of it. Having said that, I did
notice you've got a couple of drive stacks need replacing. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you did, did you?
<br>
PERKINS: Yeah. You should get someone in. And a job like that takes
forever.
<br>
DOCTOR: Really? Well, I suppose, whoever I did get in, it might
just be easier to have them stay on board for a while. I don't suppose
you'd know of anyone?
<br>
PERKINS: No. Sorry, Doctor, but I don't think I do. That job could er,
change a man.
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Frequently. <br>
(They go back up to the main deck where Clara is walking around with
her mobile phone in hand, still in her 1920s costume.)<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I won't keep you. Goodbye,
Perkins. Good to meet you.
<br>
PERKINS: You too, Doctor. And er, good luck.
<br>
(They shake. Perkins touches his cap to Clara on his way out.)<br>
CLARA: Do you love it?
<br>
DOCTOR: Love what?
<br>
CLARA: I know it's scary and difficult, but do you love being the man
making the impossible choice?
<br>
DOCTOR: Why would I?
<br>
CLARA: Because it's what you do, all day, every day.
<br>
DOCTOR: It's my life.
<br>
CLARA: Doesn't have to be. Is it like <br>
DOCTOR: Like what?
<br>
CLARA: An addiction?
<br>
DOCTOR: You can't really tell if something's an addiction till you try
and give it up.
<br>
CLARA: And you never have.
<br>
DOCTOR: Let me know how it goes.
<br>
(Clara's phone rings. She goes up to the gallery to answer it.)<br>
CLARA: Hey, Danny. How are you?
<br>
DANNY&nbsp;[OC]: Fine.
<br>
<br>
<b>[Danny's flat]<br>
<br>
</b>DANNY: So, is it done?
<br>
<br>
<b>[Tardis]</b><br>
<br>
CLARA: Yep. Mission accomplished. Listen, I can't talk now but I'll see
you soon and, er, I love you.
<br>
DANNY&nbsp;[OC]: I love you, too.
<br>
CLARA: Huh. No accounting for taste.
<br>
DANNY&nbsp;[OC]: Okay, see you soon.
<br>
DOCTOR: Was that Danny? What did he want?
<br>
CLARA: (deep breath, then) He's fine with it.
<br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, I
<br>
CLARA: Danny. He's fine with the idea of me and you knocking about.
It was his idea that we stop but, he's decided he doesn't mind and
neither do I. Oh, to hell with the last hurrah. Let's keep going.
<br>
DOCTOR: That's a big change of heart.
<br>
CLARA: Yeah, they happen.
<br>
DOCTOR: Seriously?
<br>
CLARA: Look, as long as you get me home safe and on time,
everything is great. I am so sorry. I've had a wobble. It's a big
wobble, but it's fine. Forget about it. Now, shut up and give me some
planets.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad that you said that, because you know that one
that's made entirely of shrubs. Are you sure about this?
<br>
CLARA: Are you? Have you ever been sure?
<br>
DOCTOR: No.
<br>
CLARA: Then what are you waiting for? Let's go.
<br>
(They pull the levers together, and the Tardis flies.)
