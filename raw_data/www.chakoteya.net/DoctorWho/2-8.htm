coming from the device) <br>

IAN: What's the matter? <br>
BARBARA: Doctor! Turn it off! <br>

BARBARA: Oh, that's better. <br>
IAN: Are you trying to deafen us all or something? <br>
DOCTOR: Deafen you? No, no, dear boy. It was an unfortunate
juxtaposition of the sonic rectifier with the lineal amplifier. <br>
IAN: Oh, of course. I should have know. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, what is this machine? <br>
DOCTOR: I've already told you, my dear. It's a Time and Space
Visualiser. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, but apart from making that dreadful noise, what does it
do? <br>
DOCTOR: It converts neutrons of light energy into electrical impulses. <br>
IAN: Oh, wonderful. I've always wanted one. <br>
DOCTOR: Do I detect a hint of sarcasm, dear boy? <br>
IAN: I'm sorry, Doctor, but you rattle off explanations that would have
baffled Einstein and you expect Barbara and I to know what you're
talking about. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well then, I shall quote you Ven Der Haff's law. Mass is
absorbed by light, therefore light has mass and energy. <br>
VICKI: The energy radiated by a light neutron is equal to the energy of
the mass it absorbed. <br>
DOCTOR: Splendid child, splendid. <br>
VICKI: It's quite simple. It just means that anything that ever
happens, anywhere in the universe, is recorded in light neutrons. <br>
DOCTOR: I couldn't have put it better myself, child. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, you know when I left Earth? Scientists were trying to
invent a machine that would convert the energy from light neutrons into
electrical impulses. That meant that you could just tune in and see any
event in history. <br>
BARBARA: Do you mean a sort of Time television? <br>
VICKI: Yes, like that. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what this is. <br>
BARBARA + VICKI: No! <br>
VICKI: Doctor, you're kidding! Why didn't you tell me? I could have
fixed it for you instead of you fiddling about like that. <br>
DOCTOR: I have already fixed it, my dear. My dear Chesterton, do you
mind if I distract you from your cowboys and indians? <br>
IAN: Oh, all right. <br>
DOCTOR: I want to give a little demonstration. Will you think of an
event in history? <br>
IAN: All right, I've thought of one. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, first the place. <br>
IAN: Oh, Earth, that's easy. <br>
DOCTOR: Now the geographical location, date and time. <br>
IAN: Nineteenth of November, 1863. The place, Pennsylvania, USA. <br>
DOCTOR: Good! Don't go away. <br>
(The noise starts up again and has to be turned down) <br>
DOCTOR: Watch. <br>
(An image appears on the small screen of a bearded man speaking quite
clearly and carefully in an American accent) <br>
LINCOLN [on monitor]: conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal. <br>
BARBARA: Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln! <br>
IAN: Yes, that's what I asked for. The Gettysburg address! <br>
LINCOLN [on monitor]: Civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a
great battlefield of that war. We've come to dedicate a portion of it
as a final resting place for those who gave their lives that that
nation might live. That is altogether fitting and proper that we should
do so. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow this ground. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, can I have a go? <br>
VICKI: Can I? Can I? Please? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, now, all in good time, my dear, all in good
time. Now, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: Yes? Now <br>
IAN: Did you ever see anything like it in your life? <br>
VICKI: No. <br>
IAN: Well, that was Abraham Lincoln. <br>
BARBARA: Quiet, you lot! <br>
VICKI: I know it was! <br>
IAN: Well, where are we? <br>

DOCTOR: Now you've squashed my favourite Beatles! <br>
IAN: Vicki, I had no idea you knew about the Beatles. <br>
VICKI: Of course I know about them. I've been to their Memorial Theatre
in Liverpool. <br>
BARBARA: Well, what do you think of them, Vicki? <br>
VICKI: Well, they're marvellous, but I didn't know they played
classical music! <br>
BARBARA: Classical music? <br>

BARBARA: I shouldn't think there is anything to explore. Just miles and
miles of sand. And those strange things. <br>

space-station or anything. <br>

MALSAN: (to Barbara) This desert was once a vast ocean. We, the
Aridians, lived in a city beneath the sea, but for a thousand years
those twin suns that burn, have moved closer and closer. <br>
RYNIAN: (to the Doctor) Then, then the seas dried up and all the
creatures that lived within their waters perished. <br>
(Everyone, say Hi! to Hywel Bennett) <br>
MALSAN: All but the Mire Beasts. <br>
BARBARA: Mire Beasts? What are they? <br>
MALSAN: They lived in the slime, at the bottom of the ocean. When the
waters were gone they invaded our cities. <br>
RYNIAN: There were too many of them. We tried to destroy them. They
multiplied too quickly for us. We were driven back as the Mire Beasts
took over more and more of our beautiful city. <br>
DOCTOR: These Mire Beasts, what do they feed on? <br>
MALSAN: They are flesh eaters. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean they attack humans? <br>
MALSAN: Of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor. Look, two of our friends went out into the desert.
Will you help us find them? <br>
RYNIAN: When did you see them last? <br>
BARBARA: Last night. <br>
MALSAN: The Mire Beasts hunt at night. <br>
RYNIAN: Do you think they are near or far? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think they can travel far in this sand. <br>
MALSAN: Then they might have gone through the Taltarian air-lock, into
the tunnels. <br>
RYNIAN: Then it is too late. <br>
BARBARA: What do you mean, it's too late? <br>
RYNIAN: It is to be exploded. <br>
DOCTOR: Exploded? <br>
RYNIAN: Yes, the air-lock. You see, we Aridians have learned the only
way to destroy the Mire Beast is to entomb them in the sections of the
city they have occupied. <br>
MALSAN: The Taltarian air-lock will be detonated at high suns. <br>
BARBARA: Well then, we must stop it! <br>
RYNIAN: No, we would not reach the air-lock in time. <br>
(Barbara becomes frantic and grabs Rynian) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, hush, hush, hush. <br>
BARBARA: Look, where, where is this place? <br>
RYNIAN: If we move faster than the suns? <br>
MALSAN: We will try. Follow!

DOCTOR: Yes, yes, robot's. But haven't you noticed something very
singular about this place? <br>
VICKI: Like what? <br>

Two thousand to one against. Hey, I supposed they realised I was on my
way back when. Well, who won the wars? Look, I'm Steven Taylor. Flight

DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad to know you, Steven Taylor. <br>
STEVEN: Well, this is great! I mean, it's ridiculous. I'm lost for
words. I thought if ever I met anyone again, I wouldn't stop talking
for a week! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you haven't. How long have you been here? <br>
STEVEN: As far as I can make out, about two years. <br>
VICKI: Two years? Alone? <br>
STEVEN: Well, yes. Apart from those fungus things. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean there's no other human beings here on this planet? <br>
STEVEN: No, nothing except the Mechanoids. <br>
BARBARA: Where do they come from, do you know? <br>
STEVEN: You don't know? But this is Mechanus. <br>
IAN: Sorry? <br>
STEVEN: Look, about fifty years ago Earth decided to colonise this
planet. Well, it landed a rocket full of robots programmed to clear
landing sites, get everything ready for the first immigrants. <br>
VICKI: And they didn't arrive? <br>
STEVEN: No. See, Earth got involved in interplanetary wars. I suppose
this place was forgotten. <br>
IAN: Fifty years ago? But surely these robots'd be worn out by now.
They'd have run down. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, they're programmed to do their own repairs. <br>
BARBARA: But if you're waiting for people from Earth, well, why not us?
<br>
VICKI: Yes, we could be the immigrants. <br>
STEVEN: You've got to know their code. I've been spending two years
trying to break it. Two years. I crashed, you see, out there in the
jungle and wandered around for days trying to avoid those fungus
things. Of course then the Mechanoids captured me. <br>
BARBARA: Captured? Do you mean you're a prisoner. <br>
STEVEN: Well do you think I'd stay here otherwise? I'm just like you.
We're all prisoners. Help yourself to a piece of eternity. <br>
IAN: Now, just a minute! There are five of us now. Surely we can do
something? We can fight our way out. <br>
STEVEN: Look, at the first sign of violence towards them, the
Mechanoids destroy. <br>
(Louvres are opened.) <br>
STEVEN: Now what's this? What are they playing at? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. We're being held here as specimens. <br>
VICKI: What, like something in a zoo? <br>

are on display. Aren't we, my fat little darlings?!
