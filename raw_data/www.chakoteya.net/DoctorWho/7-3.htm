TALTALIAN [OC]: (French) And one degree. How are you reading? <br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: I'm reading okay. One degree. Now. Manoeuvre
completed. <br>

VAN LYDEN [on screen]: What is my distance from Mars Probe 7? <br>
CORNISH: Distance computation, please. <br>
TALTALIAN [OC]: Distance five eight zero miles. Seven minutes, three
seconds to objective. <br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Confirmed. <br>
CORNISH: Charlie, how's it going? <br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: No problem. Everything's fine. No contact yet? <br>
CORNISH: There's been no contact for seven months. <br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: How do we know they're still alive? <br>
CORNISH: They took off from Mars manually. They must have been alive
then. <br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Something took off from Mars. <br>
TALTALIAN: (bushy beard) How is it going? <br>
CORNISH: They're closing. Charlie's a bit edgy. <br>
TALTALIAN: Can you blame him? It is possible he has gone up to a
rendezvous with a flying coffin. <br>
BRIGADIER: Do you think they're dead? <br>
CORNISH: In seven months space time, they could have fixed a defective
radio. <br>
TALTALIAN: If they are dead, it is going to turn public opinion against
our space programme. <br>
CORNISH: Frightened your computer grant might be cut, Bruno? <br>
BRIGADIER: What are you going to tell the public?&nbsp;<br>
CORNISH: That's not my job.

WAKEFIELD: In a few minutes we shall know the answer to the question
that has been occupying the minds of everyone here at Space Control
since Mars Probe 7 took off on its return journey from the red planet
nearly eight months ago. What has happened to astronauts Frank Michaels
and Joe Lefee? Communications remained perfect on the long outward
journey to the red planet and throughout the difficult landing. For a
full twelve hours they sent back pictures and reports from the surface
of Mars. Both then seemed in perfect health, then silence.

disaster had overtaken the mission. But when all hope was gone, radio
astronomers at Cambridge reported that Mars Probe 7 had blasted off and
was heading back to Earth. <br>

which has pride of place in his lab. He makes a few adjustments.) <br>
LIZ: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm trying to reactivate the Tardis' Time Vector
Generator. <br>
LIZ: What's that supposed to do?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Well, it could sent you into the future, if it starts working
again. Particularly if you're standing there. <br>
LIZ: Come on now, Doctor. <br>
(Liz dematerialises.) <br>
DOCTOR: Liz! Good grief! <br>
(He adjusts a control and dematerialises. Liz reappears.) <br>
LIZ: Doctor? Where are you? Doctor? <br>
(Liz dematerialises again and the Doctor appears. Another adjustment
and Liz returns.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. <br>
LIZ: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we both got caught in the time warp field and were
projected into the future. <br>
LIZ: Into the future? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but only about fifteen seconds. <br>
LIZ: But I haven't been anywhere. You vanished. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. You vanished first. I only seemed to have vanished
because you went into the future and I wasn't there yet. <br>
LIZ: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(The Doctor flicks a switch and Liz grabs the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Wretched thing seems to have packed up again. Still, we're
on the right lines. <br>
LIZ: Doctor, I still don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Look. <br>
(The Doctor notices something on the television.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good gracious. Lethbridge Stewart. What on Earth's he doing at
Space Control? <br>
LIZ: Well, something's happened to the Mars Probe. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, and the Brigadier thinks it's his business. Oh well, I
suppose he's got to do something to occupy his mind now that he's blown
up the Silurians. <br>
(Liz turns up the volume.) <br>
WAKEFIELD [OC]: You can see from the radar screen, that's the screen
just to the left of Professor Cornish there, that the recovery capsule
and Mars Probe 7 are on convergence. This is a tricky moment for
controller Ralph Cornish and his team. <br>

two. </font></p>

VAN LYDEN [on screen]: I can see it. I'm up alongside. <br>
CORNISH: Well done, Charlie. Everything looks good. <br>
BRIGADIER: Ask him if it's definitely Mars Probe 7. <br>
CORNISH: What? <br>
BRIGADIER: Ask him. <br>
CORNISH: Charlie, can you give us definite identification? It is Mars
Probe 7. <br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: No doubt about it. I can see the markings. <br>
CORNISH: Fine. Do you hear anything from them? <br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Still nothing. <br>
CORNISH: Try to contact once more before link up. <br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Okay. <br>
CORNISH: Maybe their transmitter's too weak to reach us down
here.&nbsp;<br>
VAN LYDEN [on screen]: Recovery 7 to Mars Probe. Do you read me? I'm
about to initiate link up. Do you read me? Nothing, Ralph. I'm going to
rotate for link up now. CORNISH: All right, Charlie. Go ahead.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WAKEFIELD: Doctor Taltalian, do you have any
explanation for that sound we just heard? <br>
TALTALIAN: At the moment, no. There is a possibility that it was some
kind of static. <br>
WAKEFIELD: Have you ever heard static like that before? <br>
TALTALIAN: In space research, one is constantly encountering new and
unexpected factors. <br>
WAKEFIELD: But will you confirm that all radio contact has been lost
with the recovery capsule? <br>
TALTALIAN: For the time being, yes, but temporary loss of communication
is not unusual. For instance, when the capsules go behind the moon <br>
WAKEFIELD: But those two capsules are not behind the moon. <br>
TALTALIAN: You can rest assured that everything possible is being done.
Now, if you will excuse me. <br>
(Taltalian leaves.) <br>
WAKEFIELD: Well, as you see, there appears to be no apparent
explanation for the sudden breakdown in communication and until the
situation becomes clearer, the world must wait and hope. </font></p>

entrance to Space Control, which is inside a rock face, rather like a
British NORAD or StarGate Command, but is actually the old cement works

CORNISH: Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? <br>
BRIGADIER: Are they still holding the same position? <br>
RUTHERFORD: Yes, they've kept on orbit. <br>
BRIGADIER: Have you any idea what might have happened to Recovery 7? <br>
CORNISH: Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? <br>
RUTHERFORD: It could have been an excess of electricity in the Mars
Probe solar batteries. If Lefee and Michaels died on take off from
Mars, there'd be no one to control the power build up in the solar
batteries. <br>
BRIGADIER: And that would've affected Recovery on link up? <br>
RUTHERFORD: When the capsules were joined the electric circuits linked
automatically. Excess electricity in one could have blown all the
circuits of the other. <br>
CORNISH: Control to Recovery 7, do you read me? <br>
BRIGADIER: Would that have killed the man in the Recovery capsule? <br>
RUTHERFORD: Not necessarily. He might still be able to unlink and bring
himself back, but without communications. <br>
(A lift platform rises to the top of the stairs down into the control
room proper. It's the Doctor and Liz. The Doctor shouts back down the
shaft.) <br>
DOCTOR: My dear fellow, I simply don't happen to have a pass! Because I
don't believe in them, that's why. <br>
(Two soldiers try to take the Doctor's arms.) <br>
DOCTOR: Take your hands off me, sir. Ah, there you are. <br>
BRIGADIER: It's all right. I can vouch for these people. <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, what are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: That sound. Have you heard it again? <br>
BRIGADIER: No. <br>
DOCTOR: You will. <br>
LIZ: He says it's some kind of a message. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, who from? <br>
DOCTOR: Have you got a recording of that message? <br>
CORNISH: I've no time to talk to the Press. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite right. Neither have I. Now, that sound, have you got a
recording of it? <br>
CORNISH: Everything here is recorded. <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, everyone here's got a great deal to do. <br>
DOCTOR: No, they haven't. There's nothing anybody can do for the time
being. <br>
CORNISH: Brigadier, who is this? <br>
BRIGADIER: He's one of my associates. <br>
CORNISH: Will you kindly get one of your associates out of here? <br>
BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Now you listen to me. That sound was some kind of a message,
and it's going to be repeated. <br>
CORNISH: Will you please get this man out of here? We're trying to save
the lives of three astronauts. <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense, man. You're doing nothing of the sort. There's
nothing you can possibly do <br>
(The noise starts up again. Everyone else covers their ears but the
Doctor concentrates hard for as long as it lasts.) <br>
DOCTOR: High frequency accelerated impulses. Now then, I shall need
multi copies of that recording, unlimited computer time and somewhere
to work. Miss Shaw, I shall need your help. <br>
CORNISH: How did you know that sound was going to be repeated? <br>
DOCTOR: By exercising my intelligence. Now, since we didn't reply, the
message would obviously be repeated. Now, we've got to break down that
code and answer them. <br>
CORNISH: Answer who? <br>
DOCTOR: The man's a fool! How can I possibly tell who the message is
from until I know what it says? Let me explain this to you in very
simple terms. <br>
BRIGADIER: He is trying to help, you know. You might find him quite
useful. <br>
DOCTOR: Might find me useful? <br>
(The Brigadier takes the Doctor aside.) <br>
BRIGADIER: I mean that you could help Professor Cornish. He is in
charge here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, of course. Look, my dear fellow, do please forgive
this intrusion, but you really must let me decode those messages. It
could prove of vital importance to the safety of your astronauts. <br>
CORNISH: I suppose we must try everything. But how you can be so sure <br>
(Another noise blasts through the room briefly.) <br>
CORNISH: It seems you're right. I'll see about that computer. <br>
DOCTOR: No, not now. <br>
CORNISH: Do you want to crack the code, send a reply? <br>
DOCTOR: That was the reply. Brigadier, I shall need worldwide
triangulation immediately. <br>
BRIGADIER: But we know where the transmissions were coming from. The
capsule in orbit. <br>
DOCTOR: The first ones, yes, but not that last one. That was completely
different. Now we've got to find out where that was coming from. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'll get on to it. <br>
CORNISH: But aren't we too late now? <br>
DOCTOR: The message was repeated. Perhaps the reply will be. All we can
do now is wait. <br>
WAKEFIELD [OC]: The mystery of Mars Probe 7 has deepened. Seven and a
half months of total silence and now these strange transmissions for
which scientists here have no explanation.

the Ministry carpet, Sir James. Someone in authority has done this. <br>
QUINLAN: The astronauts were in your charge, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: They were taken from the Space Centre by two army officers. <br>
QUINLAN: Obviously impostors. <br>
BRIGADIER: The papers of authorisation were genuine. Their passes were
made out in the names of two non-existent officers. They had a platoon
and an army vehicle of the latest design. Not the sort of thing you buy
from an army surplus store. <br>
QUINLAN: You've been very thorough, Brigadier. It's a pity you've no
explanation to offer for these strange occurrences. <br>
DOCTOR: We haven't come here to offer explanations, Sir James, we've
come to demand them. From you. <br>
QUINLAN: All right. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean you're going to tell us the truth? <br>
QUINLAN: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
QUINLAN: But I'm going to introduce you to the man who can. Will you
come in please? <br>
(Carrington enters.) <br>
QUINLAN: General Carrington, head of the newly formed Space Security
department. <br>
LIZ: Space Security? Weren't you an astronaut on Mars Probe 6? <br>
CARRINGTON: Yes, I was. Please sit down, Brigadier. I realise I owe you
all an apology. I can only ask you to believe that everything I have
done has been for the good of us all. <br>
DOCTOR: Does that include sending coded messages to Mars Probe 7? And
kidnapping three astronauts? <br>
LIZ: And Doctor Bruno Taltalian holding a gun on us in the computer
room? <br>
CARRINGTON: Taltalian was under strict orders to make sure you didn't
have access to the computer. You see, every astronaut is issued with an
emergency code only to be used in the ultimate emergency. The code
you've been trying to crack. The message we received from Mars Probe 7
told us that the deep space capsule had passed through a hitherto
unsuspected high density radiation belt on its way back to Earth orbit.
<br>
LIZ: Why didn't you inform Space Control at once? <br>
CARRINGTON: Security. <br>
BRIGADIER: Then why wasn't I informed, sir? <br>
CARRINGTON: UNIT is an international organisation and the government
wanted to keep this in its own hands. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but why all this extraordinary behaviour? Well, surely
radiation is a normal hazard of space travel? <br>
CARRINGTON: We believe this radiation to be a different kind. We
believe it to be self-sustaining and highly contagious, and that it
could spread like a plague, contaminating the entire planet. <br>
QUINLAN: We don't want the public to become panic-stricken. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it seems to have been a question of the right hand
fighting the left, doesn't it, Brigadier? <br>
CARRINGTON: Good! Well, I hope this explanation has eased your minds,
gentlemen. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it hasn't eased mine. <br>
CARRINGTON: I'm sorry? <br>
DOCTOR: I should like to take a look at these mysteriously irradiated
astronauts for myself, if I may. <br>
CARRINGTON: There's no need for that. They're in expert hands. <br>
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, I would still like to see them. <br>
QUINLAN: Well, I don't see it can do any harm. <br>
CARRINGTON: Oh, very well then, I'll take you there now. But I can
assure you they're perfectly safe.

Taltalian killed and now this man Lennox murdered under your very nose.

BRIGADIER: We're following up every possible clue. <br>
CORNISH: And what have you discovered? <br>
BRIGADIER: We've identified the two radioactive bodies that were found
in that gravel pit in Hertfordshire. They weren't foreign agents at
all, they were petty London criminals. And the explosive that killed
Doctor Taltalian was the new H37 compound which hasn't even been issued
to the Army yet. <br>
CORNISH: Then our own people could be involved. <br>
BRIGADIER: That was the Doctor's theory. Also forensics have analysed
the mud that was found on the shoes Lennox was wearing. <br>
CORNISH: And what does that tell you? <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, it could tell us where he'd been recently. You see,
there were elements of insecticide in that mud. We're now checking all
the areas where that insecticide is used. <br>
CORNISH: This isotope that killed Lennox, have you checked on that? <br>
BRIGADIER: It was part of a consignment sold some months ago. <br>

WAKEFIELD: But that's impossible, General. The worldwide hook-up won't
be ready for another hour yet. <br>
CARRINGTON: You must speed it up. Get on to your people. This is an
emergency. <br>
CORNISH: Wakefield, what are you going to do? <br>
WAKEFIELD: See if I can speed up the broadcast, of course. <br>
BRIGADIER: There's been a message from my HQ, sir. They're picking up
SOS radio signals. <br>
CARRINGTON: Well? <br>
BRIGADIER: There's a chance it may be from the Doctor, sir. I'd like to
follow it up, if you'll excuse me. <br>
CARRINGTON: Just a moment! <br>
BRIGADIER: Sir? <br>
CARRINGTON: You think I don't know what's going on, don't you? <br>
BRIGADIER: I don't quite follow you? <br>
CARRINGTON: That Doctor of yours is in league with these creatures and
you've been helping him. Security! Place this officer under close
arrest. <br>
BRIGADIER: Sir, I must protest! <br>
CARRINGTON: Hand over your revolver, Brigadier. <br>
(The Brigadier gives his gun to an MP.) <br>
CARRINGTON: I've suspected you for some time. All your UNIT people have
been locked up and replaced by men I can trust. Take him away. <br>
(As the Brigadier is escorted out, Cornish picks up a telephone.) <br>
CARRINGTON: What are you doing? <br>
CORNISH: I'm getting on to the Ministry. <br>
CARRINGTON: Too late, Mister Cornish. All communications are under my
control. <br>
CORNISH: This Space Centre is under my control. <br>
CARRINGTON: Not any longer. <br>
(The Brigadier marches along the tunnel in front of the two MPs.
Suddenly he elbows one in the stomach and hits the other, then runs to
a staff car whilst they shoot at him. He is let through the barrier
just as the phone rings in the guards hut. Again.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JOHNSON: It's no good, Sarge, I can't raise them.
Space HQ have cut themselves off. <br>
BENTON: Well, keep trying. <br>
(The Brigadier enters.) <br>
BENTON: Sir, we've been trying to reach you. <br>
BRIGADIER: Those SOS signals. Did you get a fix on them? <br>
BENTON: They cut out suddenly. We managed to pin them down around here.
It's funny, sir. It's army land. Disused firing range. <br>
BRIGADIER: Carrington. <br>
BENTON: It's quite near the Space Centre. <br>
BRIGADIER: How many men have we got here, Sergeant? <br>
BENTON: Just one or two, sir. Most of the lads are on duty at the Space
Centre. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'll take what men there are. Look, keep that radio manned
and get me a revolver, will you? <br>
BENTON: Sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: And lay on a jeep. <br>
BENTON: We can't, sir. All the transport's over at Space HQ. <br>
BRIGADIER: What? <br>
BENTON: Well, how did you get here, sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: I borrowed a staff car. <br>
BENTON: Well, couldn't we use that? <br>
BRIGADIER: Sergeant, that engine stopped quite a few bullets. I barely
made it here. Well, there must be some kind of transport? <br>
BENTON: Sir, there is the Doctor's car. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Bessie is bristling with rifles like a 30s
Chicago mobsters flivver. The Brigadier surveys the area with
binoculars then drives in closer. Masters and Flynn come out, see them
and run for the van. A gunfight starts, but UNIT have more bullets. The
bad guys surrender.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Right, get them! <br>
(Two UNIT soldiers walk up to them, and get their rifles taken. Masters
gets shot in the shoulder and the Brigadier tackles Flynn from behind.
They trade punches until the Brigadier sends him rolling down a steep
slope. His remaining soldier goes with him to the blockhouse.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> REEGAN: Now, you see, the main vault is here, and
our friends there can blast it open. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, how many times must I tell you? I am not joining you in a
programme of bank robbery. <br>
REEGAN: I'm offering you an equal share, Doctor. <br>
(Gunfire.) <br>
REEGAN: See what's happening. <br>
(A thug runs up the stairs as the Brigadier bursts through the door. He
is shot, and falls back down the stairs. Reegan gets his pistol out,
but the Brigadier shoots it out of his hand.) <br>
REEGAN: Make yourselves at home. <br>
DOCTOR: What kept you? <br>
BRIGADIER: I see you're all right, Doctor. Miss Shaw? <br>
LIZ: Just get me out of here. <br>
BRIGADIER: Carrington's taken over the Space Centre. <br>
DOCTOR: What for? <br>
BRIGADIER: He's going to make a telecast urging the world to attack the
alien spaceship. <br>
DOCTOR: We've got to stop him at once. <br>
BRIGADIER: Not so easy. He's arrested all my men and moved in his own
troops. <br>
DOCTOR: We've got to get in there somehow. <br>
REEGAN: Why don't you use them? <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I think he's right. <br>
REEGAN: You won't forget I thought of it? <br>
BRIGADIER: Get him out of here. <br>
(Reegan is taken away as the Doctor picks up the microphone and
switches on his comm unit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, we're going to return you to your own people, but first we
need your help to prevent a catastrophe.

megaphone to shout at the MPs from a distance.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Open the gates. Open these gates! <br>
(The MPs stand their ground, so UNIT let the aliens out of the van. The
Doctor uses his comm unit to advice them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Open the gates. Please try not to harm anyone. <br>
(The MPs start shooting.) <br>
DOCTOR: These aliens are invulnerable to your bullets. They will not
harm you but you will die if you touch them. Now please, keep back. <br>
(The aliens lift the barrier and walk through. The MPs retreat.
Everyone gets back into Bessie as the aliens touch the main doors,
blowing the locks, and they swing open to let the vehicles through.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CARRINGTON: When I move across to here, get your
camera in close on this creature and my men will forcibly remove his
helmet. I want the world to know what these monsters look like. <br>
WAKEFIELD: All right, General, whatever you say. <br>
CARRINGTON: Good man. <br>
CORNISH: General, you must see reason. You can't make this broadcast. <br>
CARRINGTON: Mister Cornish, don't interfere in things you don't
understand. <br>
CORNISH: It could bring down total destruction on us. <br>
CARRINGTON: You have no concept of moral duty. <br>
CORNISH: General, you must see <br>
CARRINGTON: Security! <br>
(Cornish is dragged away by the MPs.) <br>
WAKEFIELD: Five seconds to go, General. This is John Wakefield,
speaking to you live from the heart of Britain's Space Control
headquarters. This telecast is being received in homes all over the
world by communications satellite relay. <br>
(Gunshots off.) <br>
WAKEFIELD: Owing to widespread rumours concerning an unidentified
flying object hovering above this planet, General Carrington, head of
Space security, himself an ex-astronaut and Mars probe veteran, is
about to speak to you on a matter of tremendous importance. <br>

CARRINGTON: Security patrol! <br>
(Carrington runs out of bullets. The Brigadier enters, followed by the
Doctor and Benton. Other armed UNIT soldiers appear.) <br>
BRIGADIER: It's no good, General. I've released my men. This place is
in my hands. <br>
CARRINGTON: I must make this broadcast. It's a matter of world
survival. <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, General. I must place you under arrest. <br>
CARRINGTON: Arrest? <br>
(Carrington hands his empty gun to Benton, and gives the Brigadier his
revolver back.) <br>
BRIGADIER: The Sergeant will look after you. <br>
(Carrington stops in front of the Doctor.) <br>
CARRINGTON: I had to do what I did. It was my moral duty. You do
understand, don't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, General. I understand. <br>
(The Doctor walks over to the communications room door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Please release that gentleman. <br>
(The opaque screens around the alien lift and the figure with it unties
it from the chair.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, Mister Cornish, we've got to get a message up to that
alien space ship and tell them that their ambassadors are safe and
well. <br>
CORNISH: Doctor, where are my three astronauts? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear chap, they're still up there. But don't worry, they're
all right. They're quite safe. Now, we've got to make an exchange. <br>
CORNISH: Exchange? <br>
(The three aliens now stand together.) <br>
DOCTOR: We'll send these three up in Recovery 7. They'll send down our
three astronauts. <br>
CORNISH: But what about the fuel problem? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, simple. We'll use pure M3 variant. And don't forget,
they're not susceptible to g-force. <br>
CORNISH: This is Control. Get me the fuel bay. <br>
DOCTOR: Well goodbye, Mister Cornish. I've got a lot of work to do in
my own laboratory. <br>
CORNISH: Doctor, I'll need your help to communicate with the
ambassadors. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, here you are. Here's Miss Shaw. She's much more practical
than I am. Goodbye Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
LIZ: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: (to aliens) Goodbye, gentlemen. Have a nice trip. </font>
