</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A series of energy bolts hit the Tardis while it
is in flight. We go inside to see Mel and the Doctor lying unconcious
on the floor. The exercise bike collapses. An reptile-descended
lifeform watches a rainbow swoosh across the sky then the Tardis lands
in a rocky landscape. The doors open and the Rani enters, carrying a
ray gun.) <br>
RANI: Leave the girl. It's the man I want. Take him to my laboratory. <br>
(The Rani leaves, and her giant hairy bat servant rolls the Doctor over
onto his back just as his features finish regenerating. Everyone say
Hi! to my second-favourite Doctor - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566809/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sylvester McCoy.</a>)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Built into a cliff face. Another of the local
lifeforms is gently lying a familiar human with wild grey hair and
moustache onto a couch in an cabinet. She is overseen by an older male.
The Rani enters.) <br>
RANI: Sarn, stop dithering. Collecting this one has already put me
behind schedule. <br>
SARN: I don't want to harm him. <br>
RANI: Seal it and label it. <br>
(Sarn activates the cabinet. The couch slides in and a transparent door
comes down.) <br>
RANI: Well, what are you waiting for? <br>
BEYUS: You haven't given the name for the label. <br>
RANI: Einstein. <br>
(Einstein lights up above the cabinet.) <br>
RANI: Insolence could cost your people dearly, Beyus. <br>
SARN: I'm sure Beyus did not mean to appear insolent. He would never do
that. <br>
RANI: I find your incompetence more than enough without listening to
your puerile opinions. <br>
BEYUS: Then why not let Sarn go. You have me as a hostage, you don't
need her. <br>
RANI: I shall decide my needs. They unfortunately require the use of
Lakertyans. <br>
BEYUS: You leave me with no illusions about the hatred that you hold
for us. <br>
RANI: Hatred? Another fantasy. I have no feelings one way or the other.
Outside of these experiments you have absolutely no significance. <br>
BEYUS: I find your detachment difficult to understand. <br>
RANI: All you need understand is that these specimens are geniuses,
every one of them. And unless they're kept in prime condition, you'll
have more than the miserable skin of this creature to worry about. <br>
BEYUS: Have you managed to procure the means to repair your laboratory
equipment? <br>
RANI: Oh yes, indeed I have.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (She walks into the main part of her lair. The
Doctor is lying across a square table, with a multicoloured but normal
size umbrella by his outstretched left arm. The Rani checks his pupil
response and his heartbeats, then goes to a steep flight of stairs,
presses a button to open the door at the top and starts to climb.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, Mel. <br>
(The Rani comes back, closes the door and returns to the Doctor.
Suddenly he sits up.) <br>
DOCTOR: That was a nice nap. Now, down to business. <br>
(The Doctor gets off the table.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm a bit worried about the temporal flicker in sector
thirteen. There's a bicentennial refit of the Tardis to book in. I must
just pop over to Centauri Seven and then perhaps a quick holiday.
Right, that all seems quite clear. Just three small points. Where am I?
Who am I? And who are you? The Rani! Stay back! <br>
(He grabs his umbrella then steps back and falls down a short set of
stairs. Sylvester is a very good clown-tumbler.) <br>
RANI: This is idiotic. You'll injure yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: Why should you care? Since you were exiled from Gallifrey,
you've had nothing but contempt for all other Time Lords. <br>
RANI: My contempt started long before my exile. <br>
DOCTOR: And what do you want with me? And where's Mel? <br>
RANI: She's perfectly safe, but how long she remains so depends on you.
<br>
DOCTOR: You're up to something. Perhaps I'll find the answer on this. <br>
(The Doctor activates the screen in the middle of the table.) <br>
RANI: You won't recognise the planet. It's Lakertya, and there's no
evidence that it's ever been graced by your meddling presence. <br>
(The screen shows the planet from orbit then an asteroid. Alien
characters come up.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're trying to deflect me, so the answer is on here. Quarks.
One up, one down. One strange matter? That asteroid is composed of
strange matter. What monstrous experiment are you dabbling in now? <br>
RANI: I didn't go to the trouble of bringing you here just to discuss
the ethics of my work. <br>
DOCTOR: Ethics? Don't be such a hypocrite. Your past is littered with
the mutilated results of your unethical experiments. <br>
RANI: I had all I can take of that cant in our university days. Am I
expected to abandon my research because of the side effects on inferior
species. Are you prepared to abandon walking in case you squash an
insect underfoot? <br>
(The Rani takes her ray gun from the table base.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stay away. Whatever you've brought me here for, I'm having no
part of it. <br>
(And promptly tumbles down the two steps again. Sarn moves to pick him
up.) <br>
RANI: Leave him there. <br>
SARN: He may be hurt. <br>
BEYUS: Sarn, don't interfere. <br>
RANI: I'll deal with you latter. <br>
(Sarn runs out.) <br>
RANI: And that's the last time she will interfere. <br>
(The Doctor gets up and goes to a pyramid, one of four placed around
the raised table dais.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stay away or I'll smash this! <br>
RANI: Urak! <br>
DOCTOR: I'll smash it to pieces! <br>
RANI: Urak, get in here! <br>
(The hairy beast enters. The Doctor stares at it, and it fires a little
cannon that releases a net which drops over the Doctors head. He falls.
<br>
Meanwhile, the Lakertyan who watched the Tardis lands enters its open
door. He stands over Mel for a moment then picks her up and puts her
over his shoulder, looks around and leaves. <br>
Sarn flees the Rani's headquarters. The Rani's large wrist computer
beeps.) <br>
RANI: Urak, what's happening? <br>
URAK [OC]: The female Sarn has escaped, Mistress Rani. <br>
RANI: She won't get far. <br>
(The Rani calls up the view of Sarn running on her table screen.
Elsewhere, Mel wakes and frees herself from the man's hold, and runs
for her life. She meets Sarn coming the other way. Sarn changes route
and hits a trip wire. There is a flash and a scream. Sarn is trapped in
a spinning bubble that flies into the air and bounces off one cliff
edge before crashing into another and exploding. Mel's rescuer pushes
her away and goes over to the skeletal remains of Sarn. <br>
The Rani turns off the image of the skeleton and uses her wrist
computerr.) <br>
RANI: See that the trap is reset. <br>
URAK [OC]: Certainly. Your powers are truly wondrous, Mistress Rani. <br>
BEYUS: What's happened? <br>
RANI: It need not concern you. Roll up his sleeve. <br>
(Beyus obeys. The Doctor is unconscious.) <br>
BEYUS: Why are you doing this? <br>
RANI: To make sure he suffers a healthy dose of amnesia when he wakes. <br>
(The Rani injects the Doctor with a needle from a large gun.) <br>
BEYUS: Amnesia? <br>
RANI: That's what I said.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IKONA: Go on, run. Run! The area's full of traps,
as well you know. <br>
MEL: Me? Why should I? This is insane. <br>
IKONA: Don't play the innocent. Your friends set this trap. <br>
MEL: Look, it's all very well being upset <br>
IKONA: Upset? Another of your obscene murders takes place <br>
MEL: Stop accusing me. This had nothing to do with me. <br>
IKONA: Lies! If I didn't need you as a hostage, you'd be dead. <br>
MEL: A hostage? For what? <br>
IKONA: To exchange for our leader. Your friends took him prisoner. <br>
MEL: Why do you keep calling them friends of mine? <br>
IKONA: You arrived from outer space, as they did. Now they can have you
back. On my terms.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor wakes, feeling very dizzy.) <br>
DOCTOR: Where am I? Who are you? <br>
(From the back, it looks like Mel. She turns around and it is the Rani.
She pitches her voice almost perfectly to imitate her.) <br>
RANI: Mel. Melanie. Are you all right, Doctor? <br>
(She pulls the Doctor to his feet.) <br>
DOCTOR: All right? Am I? Of course. And you? <br>
RANI: Me? Yes, of course. Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Why not indeed. We both are. <br>
(The Doctor stumbles and picks up the weapon she had carried into the
Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: A bull in a barber shop. A navigational guidance system
distorter. This would force any passing spaceship into landing here.
Where are we, by the way? <br>
RANI: In your laboratory. On Lakertya. Doctor, are you sure you're
well? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. Fit as a trombone. <br>
RANI: Fiddle. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
RANI: Fit as a fiddle. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you? Nerves, I expect. Now, let's see. What were we up to,
er, Mel, did you say your name was? <br>
RANI: You don't remember me, do you? Do you? <br>
DOCTOR: Red hair. I recall red hair. <br>
(The Rani moves away to stop the Doctor touching her wig, and she gets
reflected in a nearby pyramid.) <br>
DOCTOR: Argh! Who's that? <br>
RANI: Me. <br>
DOCTOR: No, standing next to you. <br>
RANI: That's you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Me? No wonder I've lost my memory. <br>
RANI: Look, you're supposed to be conducting an experiment, not
frightening yourself to death. <br>
DOCTOR: Experiment? <br>
RANI: Yes, it exploded and threw you to the floor. Me, too. Knocked us
both cold. When I came round you looked like this. <br>
DOCTOR: The explosion must have caused me to regenerate. <br>
RANI: You mean, this is what you're going to be like permanently. <br>
DOCTOR: I want all mirrors removed from the Tardis henceforth. <br>
RANI: So you remember the Tardis, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, the Tardis. And you. Mel. There's something not quite in
sync. I must be suffering from post-regeneration amnesia. <br>
RANI: Oh, don't worry. It'll soon wear off. Meanwhile, why not repair
the machine? You said it was important. <br>
DOCTOR: Important? Did I? I wonder what I was up to. <br>
(The Doctor takes the cover off the large metal pyramid with charring
by a grill and peers inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, seems pretty far gone. Need a genius to unravel it. <br>
RANI: But you're a genius. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I definitely remember that. <br>
RANI: Especially in thermodynamics. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you know that, Mel? <br>
RANI: You told me. You said it was your special subject when you were
at university. <br>
DOCTOR: University? You remind me of someone I used to know when I was
there. <br>
RANI: Doctor, this machine has to be repaired and you're the only
person with the knowledge to do it. <br>
DOCTOR: Your confidence in me is very flattering, Mel. <br>
(The Rani takes another side off the pyramid.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ikona has tied Mel's hands and is leading her
with a rope down a steep slope.) <br>
MEL: Will you listen? How many more times do I have to tell you I'm not
your enemy. Look, can we start from scratch? My name's Mel and I come
from Earth. Your turn. <br>
IKONA: This is no game. <br>
MEL: All right, let's try another tack. You claim I was alone when you
found me. <br>
IKONA: Oh, don't go on about this Doctor again. <br>
MEL: I have to. <br>
IKONA: There was no one else in the strange box. If he exists, he must
have left you. <br>
MEL: No way. The Doctor wouldn't do that. <br>
IKONA: If he has any sense he would. <br>
MEL: It's not even up for discussion. <br>
IKONA: Good, I shall enjoy the silence. <br>
MEL: Watch out! <br>
(Ikona trips a wire but Mel pulls him back before he can get trapped in
the bubble. It whirrs off to explode on the cliff face.) <br>
MEL: Now will you accept that I'm not your enemy? <br>
IKONA: We must hurry. The Tetraps will come to investigate. <br>
(Ikona unties Mel's wrists.) <br>
MEL: What made you think I was in league with them? <br>
IKONA: You're not Lakertyan. You don't belong on this planet. <br>
MEL: Then they're human, like me? <br>
IKONA: No, not like you, although almost as hideous. <br>

it go bang and spark.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. <br>
RANI: Come on where? <br>
DOCTOR: Why I chose you as an assistant, I'll never know. Perhaps I
will when I've regained my memory. <br>
RANI: Well, what is it you want? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, look at me. Can't you see? Mop my brow! <br>
(The Rani uses a handkerchief then turns away. The Doctor takes two
spoon-shaped implements from a rack, places them back to back and plays
them. When he uses the Rani for the percussion she knocks them out of
his hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: What'd you do that for? <br>
RANI: It was your fault. <br>
DOCTOR: A bad workman always blames his fools. <br>
RANI: Tools! Blames his tools! <br>
DOCTOR: Do I detect a hint of bad temper, Mel? Why are you behaving so
uppity? Could it be that you think yourself superior to me? <br>
RANI: Now how could I possibly think that, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Quite. Though at the moment I feel far from superior. This is
all a mystery to me. <br>
RANI: But surely there's a catalyst? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes. Must you state the obvious? I know that its
functions diffuse the impulses from there with this goo. But what's it
for? I'm beginning to think this set-up's got nothing to do with me. <br>
RANI: Why do you think that? <br>
DOCTOR: Omnipotence. The mind behind this bag of tricks operates on a
grand scale. <br>
RANI: Well, all the more reason to suppose that it's you, Doctor.

IKONA: We must keep moving. <br>
MEL: What happened to the rest of your people? Won't they help? <br>
IKONA: No, they've been completely subdued. <br>
MEL: We could at least try. <br>
IKONA: The only one they listen to is Beyus, our leader. <br>
MEL: All right, let's go to him. <br>
IKONA: He's the hostage I wanted to exchange you for. Shush. Listen. <br>

IKONA: Quickly! <br>
MEL: We can't go that way, it's completely exposed. <br>
IKONA: For once, don't argue. <br>
(They follow a track through a large puddle and into a large sewer
pipe.) <br>
IKONA: Hopefully they'll think we doubled back to stay undercover. <br>

DOCTOR: What's in there? <br>
RANI: I have no idea. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you as clueless as you appear, Mel? <br>
RANI: Don't blame me, Doctor. I've never been inside. You wouldn't let
me. <br>
DOCTOR: Wouldn't I? <br>
RANI: No. You said the air wasn't sterile enough for humans. <br>
DOCTOR: That's it, then. I'm doing nothing until my memory returns.
Nothing until I know what I'm about. <br>
RANI: Oh, come on, now. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I will not work in the dark like this. <br>
RANI: But you thrive on challenge. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm adamant. This could be some diabolical scheme. <br>
RANI: To do what? <br>
DOCTOR: That's the question. <br>
RANI: Oh, Doctor, really. <br>
(Behind his back, the Rani opens a lid in the corner of the table and
takes out a small bottle. <br>
Meanwhile, in another part of her HQ, Beyus picks up a bill hook, goes
to a grill set at an angle in the floor and opens it, then goes down
some steps. In the dark are more hairy monsters like Urak. Beyus pulls
a chain that releases red goo to run down a channel in the middle of
the steps, then leaves and fastens the grill shut. <br>
The Rani pours the contents of the bottle into a glass of blue water,
turning it clear. She puts the bottle back in its hole and takes the
glass to the Doctor. <br>
) RANI: You're just over-excited. Here, drink this. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? What is it? <br>
RANI: Just water. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you drink it. I don't want it. Don't try to humour me.
Leave me alone. <br>
RANI: You can't loll around. It's simply not like you. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you know what I'm like? I've regenerated. I mean, look
at me. Look at me. <br>
RANI: Yes, you've changed outwardly. But I'm sure you must still have
the same sweet nature. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps this is my new persona. Sulky, bad-tempered. I mean,
think how I spoke to you earlier. <br>
RANI: But you didn't mean it. I was at fault. <br>
DOCTOR: Even so, that's probably how I am now. You don't understand
regeneration, Mel. It's a lottery, and I've drawn the short plank.
Anyway, I need a radiation wave meter and, brilliant as I am, even I
can't improvise that. <br>
RANI: What about the Tardis? Won't there be a radiation wave meter
there? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis? Do you know where it is? <br>
RANI: Yes, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good. I fancy a breath of fresh air. We'll both go. <br>
RANI: No, wait. <br>

(Meanwhile, the Rani and the Doctor have reached Sarn's remains.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rather unusual species. Can't say I recognise it. Humanoid with
reptilian influences, wouldn't you say, Mel? <br>
RANI: Lakertyan. A race so indolent they can't be bothered to bury
their dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? I suppose we've explored this planet. I wish I could
remember. <br>
RANI: There's not a lot to remember. The benevolent climate has induced
lethargy. They've failed to realise their full potential. <br>
DOCTOR: Rather a harsh judgment, Mel. <br>
RANI: Not mine. Yours. <br>
DOCTOR: The more I know me, the less I like me. <br>

Tardis and go inside.) <br>

our experiment, we must be playing with fire. <br>
