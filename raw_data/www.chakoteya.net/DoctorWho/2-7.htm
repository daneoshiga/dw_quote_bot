Tardis materialises, and everybody is wearing their ordinary clothes,
not the Crusader ones they had on when they became immobile at the end
of the last episode. The Doctor moves first, then Vicki.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, lights. Oh, that’s better. Ah, good! Well now, we seem to
have materialised much quicker than I thought. <br>
IAN: Doctor, we’ve got our clothes on. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I should hope so, dear boy. I should hope so. <br>
BARBARA: No, Doctor. Our ordinary, everyday clothes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, upon my soul, yes. Yes. Now isn’t that extraordinary?
Yes, we were wearing those cloaks and things, weren’t we? Well, I must
say, it’s going to save us a lot of bother changing. Yes. Now, lets see
where we are, shall we? <br>
IAN: Doctor! You can’t dismiss it like that! We were standing here in
thirteenth century clothes. We can’t suddenly <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, it’s over and done with. Now lets forget it. See
where we are. Come along, pay attention. <br>
VICKI: But Doctor, where are the clothes we were wearing? <br>
DOCTOR: I expect, child, they’re hanging up where they’re supposed to
be. If you’re that much concerned, go and have a look. <br>
VICKI: All right. I will. <br>
DOCTOR: And on your way back, bring me glass of water please, I’m very
parched. <br>
VICKI: Okay. <br>
(Vicki leaves) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dear, dear, dear. Now where were we? All this fussation
about a change of clothes. You know, its so simple. It’s time and
relativity, my dear boy. Time and relativity. That’s where the answer
lies. <br>
IAN: I dare say it does, Doctor, but we’d be a lot happier if you would
explain it to us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know. Well, at the moment there isn’t time. Now,
just pay attention, will you? (Looking up at the scanner.) What’s this?
<br>
VICKI [OC]: Doctor! Our crusading clothes are here. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good! There you are, you see? Yes, you see?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Well, the scanners functioning. Looks like
desert to me. <br>
BARBARA: Oh look! Spaceships! <br>
(On the scanner, the multitude of spacecraft appears.) <br>
BARBARA: Well, it’s so quiet, it could be a graveyard. <br>
IAN: No, more like a launching pad to me. Maybe it’s a dumping ground. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don’t think so, my boy, no. No, all those things up there
come from a different period. <br>
BARBARA: Well, there isn’t any sign of life. Look! There’s a building.
What do you make of that, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I’m afraid I can’t give you any answers here, my dear. <br>
IAN: You mean you want to go and have a closer look, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I don’t see why not. After all, the readings say it’s
quite safe. <br>
BARBARA: Safe? Well the readings don’t always tell us everything, you
know. <br>
(Vicki brings the glass of water and the Doctor drinks it) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, my dear. Thank you. So you dropped a glass, did
you? <br>
VICKI: Yes, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don’t look so concerned, child. It’s quite easily
replaced. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, it doesn’t have to be. It all came together again and
jumped up into my hand. Well, if you don’t believe me, you can go and
look. There hasn’t been time to clear it up yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, yes, we believe you, child. Yes, we believe you. <br>
VICKI: Honestly, that’s exactly what happened. <br>
BARBARA: You dropped a glass, and it came together again in your hands?
<br>
VICKI: With the water in it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, look! Look! You see where we’ve landed? On a museum. <br>
IAN: A museum? <br>
BARBARA: A space museum, yes! <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. If you take a closer look at those objects, you’ll
see that some of them are more advanced in design. It’s quite a natural
progression. <br>
IAN: Oh, well, someone must be in charge of them. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we shall find that out. And I’m sure you will agree with
me, there are several things that we would like an answer to. So I
suggest we go outside and take a look for ourselves, hmm?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: Dust everywhere. Maybe you were right about
the graveyard. <br>
(The Doctor locks the Tardis) <br>
VICKI: Hey, Doctor. Come here and have a look at this. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, isn’t that extraordinary? I’ve never seen erosion in such
an advanced stage. The whole planet appears to be completely dead. <br>
IAN: Dead? <br>
DOCTOR: Non-existent, extinct. <br>
IAN: Oh? I’ve always associated extinction with extreme cold. You know,
something like the dark side of the moon. Haven’t you? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I must say, the atmosphere’s quite pleasant. <br>
IAN: Yeah. <br>
BARBARA: Well, maybe it’ll get colder as it gets dark. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think we shall just have to go and search for the
answers, and as there’s always the element of danger in the unknown, I
suggest we keep closer together. Is that clear? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Vicki? <br>
VICKI: Oh, er, yes, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now I’ll take the lead and lets try and find those
buildings we saw on the scanner. <br>
IAN: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, what is it now, dear boy? <br>
IAN: We’re walking on dust. Several inches thick, I’d say. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, so it appears, hmm. <br>
IAN: Then why aren’t we leaving any footprints? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s curious, isn’t it? Yes, very curious.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The walls of the museum are made of something very
alien, with triangular bits sticking out to form a texture) <br>
BARBARA: What an extraordinary building. <br>
IAN: Yes. This looks like the only door. <br>
BARBARA: No windows either. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we certainly haven’t met anyone yet. <br>
VICKI: Maybe there isn’t anybody. <br>
DOCTOR: How are we going to get in there? <br>
IAN: Well, I don’t know. There doesn’t seem to be any way of opening
the door. <br>
BARBARA: Have you noticed something? I mean something very peculiar. <br>
IAN: Well, everything’s peculiar. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Barbara, if you’ve seen something or somebody, there’s
no sense in talking in riddles, is there? <br>
BARBARA: No Doctor, not seen. Its the silence. When we stop talking,
there isn’t a sound. Listen. It’s the sort of silence you can almost
hear. <br>
IAN: More and more like a graveyard. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that’s quite enough. Now stop it. You'll have us all
imagining things. There must be an explanation of this little <br>
(The doors open showing two people coming towards them) <br>
IAN: There’s someone coming! <br>
DOCTOR: Hide quickly! <br>
VICKI: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Up against the wall. Quick! <br>
(Barbara stops Vicki sneezing as two men in white approach. But as they
go past Vicki does sneeze) <br>
VICKI: I’m sorry! It just came out. <br>
BARBARA: It’s all right, Vicki. They didn’t hear it. <br>
IAN: They were only a few feet away. <br>
BARBARA: I know. <br>
DOCTOR: It’s extremely doubtful that they were both deaf. However, the
fact is, they didn’t hear. Now, let’s see what’s in here.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Museum entrance hall]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Some mechanical equipment and a spacesuit on
display) <br>
BARBARA: Well, there aren’t any windows. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I think there’s probably something in the atmosphere that,
er, has a very slow destructive property, er, hence the lack of
windows. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, but I don’t understand where the light comes from? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I think that might just be some florescent substance in the
walls. Yes, well, I think you two must admit that my assumption as to
where we were, has been proved correct. <br>
IAN: Yes, we might almost be in a museum at home. <br>
VICKI: Except that there are no little men following you about telling
you not touch things. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you just pretend there are, young lady, and keep your
hands to yourself. <br>
BARBARA: Well, everything seems quite normal. <br>
DOCTOR: Well why not? Why shouldn’t it be? It’s quite natural. After
all, you have objects of historical interest on Earth, so why not a
museum in space? I always thought I’d find one someday. <br>
IAN: Those two men we saw must have been guards. Who started all this,
do you think, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose the answer's here somewhere. That’s what we’ve
got to find out. Let’s go and have a look in that other room.
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Chesterton! <br>
IAN: It can’t be! <br>
(The adults recoil at the sight of a large pepperpot with a bad
disposition, but it is only an exhibit labelled Dalek, Planet Skaro.) <br>
VICKI: So that’s what a Dalek looks like. <br>
DOCTOR: Don’t touch, child. <br>
BARBARA: What do you know about them, Vicki? <br>
VICKI: Only what I’ve read in history books. That they invaded Earth
about three hundred years ago, was it? <br>
IAN: We were there, Vicki. That was one of the periods we visited. <br>
DOCTOR: I don’t mind admitting, my boy, that that thing gave me a
start. Coming face to face to it again. <br>
VICKI: It’s not a bit the way I imagined it. Oh, I mean, the books
describe them all right but well, this one looks quite friendly. <br>
BARBARA: Friendly? <br>
IAN: You wouldn’t say that, young lady, if ever we meet them again.
Which to say the least is very unlikely. I hope. <br>
DOCTOR: Back. Get behind the case. Quick. Quick. Quick. Don’t touch it.
<br>
(They crouch down as two young men in black enter the room. They appear
to be talking although we don't hear them. They look around then
leave.) <br>
IAN: All right. They’ve gone. <br>
VICKI: They were talking. <br>
DOCTOR: Undoubtedly. <br>
BARBARA: Yet we didn’t hear a word they said. <br>
IAN: No. Perhaps they have some other means of communication. You know,
on a very high frequency, or. No? Not very good? <br>
BARBARA: What do you think, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don’t know. Chesterton might have had the answer in
what he just said but, er, I doubt it, I doubt it. Come on. Come on.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Another Museum room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: Well, they didn’t seem hostile. That’s
something to be thankful for. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, I don’t know. Even the Daleks are friendly to some. <br>
IAN: Vicki, yes. <br>
BARBARA: Anyway, even if they are friendly, I doubt if we’ll get much
conversation out of them, unless one of you can lip-read. <br>
(Vicki tries to touch an exhibit but her hand passes through it) <br>
VICKI: Doctor! Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Child, don’t make so much noise. What’s the matter? <br>
VICKI: I touched that thing and <br>
DOCTOR: I thought I told you not to touch. When are you going to learn
to obey me? How you <br>
BARBARA: All right, Doctor. You can save the scolding till later. Look,
can’t you see that Vicki’s upset? <br>
DOCTOR: Upset? Upset? Whatever for? Why are you upset child? What’s the
matter? <br>
VICKI: I touched that thing and my hand went right through it. <br>
(Ian tries to touch the apparatus too) <br>
VICKI: See? There isn’t anything there, is there? <br>
DOCTOR: Incredible. <br>
VICKI: Well, there is something there, isn’t there? I mean, we can all
see it, can’t we? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, of course we can, Vicki. <br>
DOCTOR: That’s strange. Strange indeed. You know, there must be a
logical explanation for this somewhere? You know, I think it’s just a
matter of putting two and two together to make three. You know there is
<br>
IAN: Doctor, look. <br>
(three black-clad men have entered) <br>
VICKI: Oh, quick, let’s hide! <br>
BARBARA: Well, where can we hide? Doctor, what shall we do? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Stand exactly where we are. <br>
(the three men walk past them) <br>
IAN: What do you make of that? <br>
DOCTOR: I’ve never known anything in my life. In all my years of time
travelling, I <br>
VICKI: That one looked straight at me. <br>
DOCTOR: Utterly unbelievable. <br>
VICKI: And he was talking. His lips were moving. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so strange. And yet we have no communication with them. <br>
BARBARA: Well then, obviously they couldn’t see us. I mean, we’re
strangers, our clothes are different. If they had seen us, they would
have made some sign, however slight. <br>
IAN: Right, we’re invisible. That settles it. <br>
DOCTOR: Does it, my boy? Does it? Either that or we’re not really here.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Museum Exhibit room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (another one) <br>
IAN: It’s the biggest museum I’ve ever been in. We must have walked for
miles. <br>
VICKI: And all the rooms are exactly the same, just cases and cabinets.
I’m beginning to think the Doctor’s wrong. <br>
IAN: Oh? <br>
VICKI: Well, how can we find the answer in here? <br>
DOCTOR: I have no idea, my child, but until I say otherwise, we
continue the search. Now, let us see what’s in here, hmm? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, same as all the others, I suppose. <br>
(and there's the Tardis) <br>
DOCTOR: Good gracious me! <br>
IAN: Well, how did that get in here? <br>
BARBARA: What does it matter? Look, now that we’ve found the Tardis,
come on, let’s get out of here. <br>
IAN: Yes, I agree, it’s a stroke of luck. Let’s leave at once. <br>
VICKI: I’ve had enough of this place, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? You’ve all decided, have you? <br>
(But the Tardis isn't tangible) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m afraid it’s going to be a little more difficult than
that. The mists are beginning to clear slightly. I’m just beginning to
see reason. Where are we? Where are we? <br>
BARBARA: Well, here, surely? <br>
DOCTOR: Are we? We must have arrived here in the Tardis sometime. Are
we here? Look! <br>
(Then they see themselves in exhibit cases) <br>
BARBARA: That’s us. That’s not models or pictures. That’s us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, exhibits in a Space Museum. <br>
IAN: Can you explain it, Doctor? <br>
VICKI: Time, like space, although a dimension in itself also has
dimensions of its own. <br>
DOCTOR: So you know about it, child? We must have a little chat some
time. <br>
VICKI: Yes, you see, we really are in those cases, but we’re also
standing here looking at ourselves from this dimension. <br>
BARBARA: Well, it’s horrible. Those faces, our faces, just staring. <br>
IAN: Well, at least it explains what’s been happening to us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it does, my boy. And if we’re not there, we can’t leave
footprints, and break glasses, or touch things. <br>
IAN: And nobody can see us. I see. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, they can. Oh yes, they can see us where we really are.
There. <br>
BARBARA: Is there anyway of getting out of this, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my dear, I suppose we got into it. There must be. You
know, I don’t mind admitting, I’ve always found it extremely difficult
to solve the fourth dimension. And here we are. Face to face with the
fourth dimension. You know, I think the Tardis jumped a time track and
ended up here in this fourth dimension. It’s extraordinary. It’s
inexplicable. No, wait a minute, wait a minute. I think you’re all
going to be delighted. I’m going to come up with the answer and it’s so
simple. Yes, so simple. <br>
BARBARA: How simple? <br>
DOCTOR: All we have to do is to wait here until we arrive. <br>
BARBARA: I beg your pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: You see, my dear, before they actually put us in those glass
cases, we must have arrived here sometime in the Tardis. These people
saw us and thought we were worthy people to be put in their Space
Museum. Then <br>
BARBARA: I see! I think. <br>
DOCTOR: But nothing has happened to us yet. What we are doing now is
taking a glimpse into the future, or what might be or could be the
future. All that leads up to it, is still yet to come. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, look. Why don’t we go and find the Tardis, the real one
I mean, and get into it and get out of here now? <br>
DOCTOR: And end up one day, my dear, like that? No, we must not. We’ve
got to stop it happening. <br>
IAN: Doctor, when will we arrive? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, my boy, I can’t be certain. You see, I’m quite
unable to measure the time dimension that the Tardis jumped. But you’ll
notice we’re all wearing the same clothes. So, it could be in a few
moments, or a few seconds. <br>
BARBARA: Well, how will we know when we have? Arrived, I mean. <br>
DOCTOR: The cases will disappear and we shall all become visible. <br>
IAN: And from that moment we’ll be in great danger. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. So you see we must succeed in stopping them making
exhibits of us. Otherwise, well, there it is. That’s how we’re all
going to end up. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
BARBARA: Something strange is happening! I can feel it.

more mimmians before I can go home. Yes, I say it often enough, but
it’s still two thousand Xeron days and it sounds more in days. Yeah, I
know, I volunteered, you were ordered. If the truth were known, I was
just as bored on Morok. Still it was home, and youth never appreciates
what it has. Oh, I don’t know what I’m going to do now. Still, let’s
get on with it, shall we? I have to sign these reports. I don’t know. <br>

calendar. Have the crew been detained? <br>

no trace of them. We were unable to enter the craft but it appears to
be uninhabited at the moment. <br>

LOBOS: Commander B Division? We have uninvited visitors. How many? <br>

used for. A museum. Well, if they came here knowing that, and they must
have done, it can only be to see the Moroks. <br>

never heard of the Moroks. <br>

BARBARA: We must break the chain of events that led up to it, and going
out of here might be just what we’re not supposed to do. <br>

here, it could change the future. Perhaps if we wait until we’re taken
out, that might change the future. The point is, what are we going to
do? Which is it to be? <br>
VICKI: But Doctor, if we find the Tardis and leave here, then we won’t
have to worry about being turned into dummies at all. <br>
IAN: That’s a good point, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: It isn’t a good point at all, my dear boy. The fact is the
future, our future, whether we leave here in the Tardis or not. <br>
IAN: Yes, I see. It’s a difficult problem, isn’t it? <br>

VICKI: There’s no answer. But, Doctor, we’ve got to decide on
something. <br>

BARBARA: The Doctor’s curious. That means we stay. <br>
VICKI: You’ve lost a button. <br>
IAN: Oh, so I have. <br>
DOCTOR: Lost a button? Hmm, that’s interesting. Yes, that’s very
interesting. <br>
IAN: Doctor, why do you always show the greatest interest in the least
important things? <br>
DOCTOR: The least important things sometimes, my dear boy, lead to the
greatest discoveries. Like steam, for instance, coming out of a kettle.
Yes, I was with him at the time. Let’s see now, yes, what was that
fellow's name? <br>
BARBARA: James Watt. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you know, losing a button could change the future. It’s a
pity, my dear boy, you didn’t discover it was missing in the cases when
we were standing there staring at each other. <br>
IAN: Doctor, I’d just come face to face with myself. I wasn’t counting
the buttons on my jacket. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I quite understand that. Well, I think we should leave the
Museum, try and find the Tardis, and make sure that it doesn’t end up
in here. Are you all agreeable? <br>
VICKI: Yes! <br>

LOBOS: Welcome to Xeros, a planet in the Morok empire. What is your
name? <br>

LOBOS: Very well. Mine is Lobos. I am the governor of this planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Curator of a Museum is a better title. <br>
LOBOS: Ah, so now you choose to speak. Good. Yes, Xeros is a museum. A
lasting memorial to the achievements of the Morok civilisation. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Well, from my observation it seems to arouse very
little interest. <br>
LOBOS: People tire of their heritage. Three hundred mimmians ago,
sightseers filled this planet, marvelling at what they saw. Today, the
occasional spaceship from Morok calls. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps if you reduced the price of admission? <br>
LOBOS: You have a sense of humour too. Unfortunately, that is not the
reason. Our civilisation rests on its laurels. Galactic conquests are a
thing of the past. Life, it is now said, is purely a thing to enjoy. <br>
DOCTOR: Decline and fall of the Roman empire. Oh yes, it’s happened
before, yes. In many galaxies far beyond your reach. <br>
LOBOS: Why do you come here? <br>

have someone intelligent and enquiring to talk to. <br>

your companions? We can get all the information we require without the
need to resort to brute force. Of course, your cooperation would have
made things easier, but it isn’t essential. I will repeat the question.

faulty connection has given our friend here another chance. Go with the
Commander. When you’ve got them, bring the aliens to me. <br>

VICKI: Barbara! Are you all right? You look terrible. <br>
BARBARA: No, I’m fine. <br>
DAKO: Sita! Where did you come from? And guns! <br>
SITA: Yes, the revolution's finally started. We broke into the armoury.
Tor is leading an attack on the Morok barracks. <br>
DAKO: Well, why aren’t you there? <br>
SITA: We came for you. <br>
VICKI: Is Ian still inside? <br>
BARBARA: Well, I don’t see how he could be. I think he must have been
captured by the guards. <br>
VICKI: Taken to wherever the Doctor is, I suppose. Oh, Barbara, we’ve
got to find them. We’ve got a chance now. <br>
BARBARA: Why? What’s happened? <br>
VICKI: Everything’s going to be all right, I know it is. When the
revolution succeeds, Tor and the Xerons are going to destroy this
Museum and all the exhibits. Well, we can’t be put in a museum that
doesn’t exist any more, can we? <br>
SITA: Dako and myself are going to try and see if we can find Tor. Are
you coming? <br>
VICKI: No, I don’t think so, are we, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: Well, we must find out where Ian and the Doctor were taken.
And if that means just wandering around the exhibition aimlessly, well,
we may as well go with them, Tor. <br>
VICKI: Where will they be taken? <br>
SITA: The Governor’s office, I expect. First of all, anyway. <br>
VICKI: We don’t want to go there, do we? <br>
COMMANDER: Possibly not, but that’s where you are going. <br>
(The Moroks shoot Sita and Dako) <br>
VICKI: Sita. <br>
COMMANDER: (taking Vicki's gun) Where did you get this? I asked you a
question. <br>
VICKI: I, I can’t remember. <br>
COMMANDER: Soldier. Have their been any guerilla actions against us? <br>
GUARD: None recently. <br>
COMMANDER: Have any arms fallen into Xeron hands? <br>
GUARD: No, sir, not that I know of. <br>
COMMANDER: It seems as though our illustrious Governor is going to have
more than his usual batch of questions to ask. Move.

report as soon as he gets there. <br>

LOBOS: I don’t think anything, Commander. All I know is that this gun
came from the weapons store. <br>

DOCTOR: Chesterton, Chesterton. Save your strength. It’ll take much
more than that to get us out of this situation. <br>
IAN: Well, exhibits in a forgotten museum, eh? Is that how we’re all
going to end up? Not with this apparatus. <br>
(Ian rips a piece of the dome contraption and stamps on it) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my boy, you’d hardly call me a pessimist, but I think
it’s most unlikely that that is the only contraption of its kind. <br>
BARBARA: Well, you can’t blame Ian for letting off steam, Doctor. Oh, I
wish I’d had thought of it. I’d have smashed the whole thing too. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I would have done the same thing. <br>
VICKI: But we must have changed the future! We just must have done! <br>
BARBARA: Must we Vicki? Or were all the things that happened planned
out for us? Four separate journeys. Four choices, that led all the
time, closer to here. Maybe it could have changed things if I hadn’t
left that Museum. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and perhaps I shouldn’t have got myself captured. <br>
IAN: Well, if your all joining in, I suppose I. Oh, what’s the use. <br>

BARBARA: But Doctor, what can we do now to <br>
DOCTOR: My dear Barbara, you must try and remember, the short time
we’ve been on this planet, we’ve met people, spoken to them and who
knows, we might have even influenced them. <br>
VICKI: That’s what I was trying to say, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I knew you were, child, yes. Yes, I knew you were. <br>
IAN: You mean we don’t necessarily have to change our own future. It
could be changed for us. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite so, yes, quite so, my boy. <br>

that’s been giving us all this dimensional trouble. <br>

don’t know whether you’ve gone into a room and switched on the light
and had to wait for a second or two before the thing lit itself up. <br>

will be broken up. <br>

need it. <br>

for what I take in my ship, and another thing, I will not have <br>
BARBARA: Oh no, Doctor, of course you don’t. But, er, what is it? It
looks terribly interesting. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, as a matter of fact, my dear, it’s what they call a
Time and Space Visualiser. You know, I couldn’t believe my eyes when I
saw it in the Space Museum. And I have an idea I can get it working
again. <br>
IAN: Yes, Doctor, but what exactly does it do? <br>
DOCTOR: You will see, you will see. All in good time. Now then, have
you said your goodbyes? <br>
