white plastic Christmas tree and putting presents under it. She looks
at the one for Rose and gazes wistfully into the distance. <br>
Meanwhile, at Mickey's work, Noddy Holder is screaming 'Merry
Christmas' on the radio when another sound can be faintly
heard above it and John's hammering.) <br>
MICKEY: Hey, turn that down. Turn it off, Stevo. Turn that off! John,
shut up! <br>
(It's a familiar whooshing sound. Mickey runs out.)

MICKEY: Jackie, it's the Tardis! <br>
JACKIE: I know, I know, I heard it. She's alive, Mickey. I said so,
didn't I? She's alive! <br>
MICKEY: Just shut up a minute. <br>
JACKIE: Well, where is it then? <br>
(The Tardis comes out of the vortex in mid air and bounces off one
block of flats, a second and a third before avoiding a post office van
and finally crashing into a set of waste bins. The Doctor opens the
door, still in t-shirt and leather jacket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here we are then, London. Earth. The Solar System. We did it.
Jackie. Mickey. Blimey! No, no, no, no, hold on. Wait there. I've got
something to say. There was something I had to tell you, something
important. What was it? No, hold on, hold on. Hold on, shush, shush,
shush, shush. Oh, I know! Merry Christmas! <br>
(The Doctor collapses. Rose comes out of the Tardis.) <br>
ROSE: What happened? Is he all right? <br>
MICKEY: I don't know, he just keeled over. But who is he? Where's the
Doctor? <br>
ROSE: That's him, right in front of you. That's the Doctor. <br>
JACKIE: What do you mean, that's the Doctor? Doctor who? </font></p>

bed. Jackie comes in with a stethoscope.) <br>
JACKIE: Here we go. Tina the cleaner's got this lodger, a medical
student, and she was fast asleep, so I just took it. Though I still say
we should take him to hospital. <br>
ROSE: We can't. They'd lock him up. They'd dissect him. One bottle of
his blood could change the future of the human race. No! Shush! <br>
(Rose listens to both sides of the Doctor's chest.) <br>
ROSE: Both working. <br>
JACKIE: What do you mean, both? <br>
ROSE: Well, he's got two hearts. <br>
JACKIE: Oh, don't be stupid. <br>
ROSE: He has. <br>
JACKIE: Anything else he's got two of? <br>
ROSE: Leave him alone. <br>
(Rose and Jackie leaves. The Doctor exhales some of the Tardis's golden
energy, which flies off into space.)

JACKIE: How can he go changing his face? Is that a different face or is
he a different person? <br>
ROSE: How should I know? Sorry. The thing is I thought I knew him, Mum.
I thought me and him were. And then he goes and does this. I keep
forgetting he's not human. The big question is where'd you get a pair
of men's pyjamas from? <br>
JACKIE: Howard's been staying over. <br>
ROSE: What, Howard from the market? How long's that been going on? <br>
JACKIE: A month or so. First of all, he starts delivering to the door
and I thought, that's a odd. Next thing you know, it's a bag of oranges
<br>
ROSE: Is that Harriet Jones? <br>
(Rose goes into the living room.) <br>
JACKIE: Oh, never mind me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: Why's she on the telly? <br>
JACKIE: She's Prime Minister now. I'm eighteen quid a week better off.
They're calling it Britain's Golden Age. I keep on saying my Rose has
met her. <br>
ROSE: Did more than that. Stopped World War Three with her. Harriet
Jones. <br>
MAN [on TV]: Prime Minister, what about those calling the Guinevere One
Space Probe a waste of money? <br>
HARRIET: [on TV]: Now, that's where you're wrong. I completely disagree
if you don't mind. The Guinevere One Space Probe represents this
country's limitless ambition. British workmanship sailing up there
among the stars. <br>
LLEWELLYN [on TV]: This is the spirit of Christmas, birth and
rejoicing, and the dawn of a new age, and that is what we're achieving
fifteen million miles away. Our very own miracle. <br>
NARRATOR [OC]: The unmanned probe Guinevere One is about to make it's
final descent. Photographs of the Martian Landscape should be
received by midnight tonight. <br>
(Out in space, the probe bumps into presumably either Phobos or Deimos.
A hatch opens in the Martian moon and the probe is sucked inside.)

Ye Merry, Gentlemen.) <br>
MICKEY: So what do you need? Twenty quid? <br>
ROSE: Do you mind? I'll pay you back. <br>
MICKEY: Call it a Christmas present. <br>
ROSE: God, I'm all out of synch. You just forget about Christmas and
things in the Tardis. They don't exist. You get sort of timeless. <br>
MICKEY: Oh, yeah, that's fascinating, because I love hearing stories
about the Tardis. Oh, go on Rose, tell us another one because I swear I
could listen to it all day. Tardis this, Tardis that. <br>
ROSE: Shut up. <br>
MICKEY: Oh, and one time the Tardis landed in a big yellow garden full
of balloons. <br>
ROSE: I'm not like that! <br>
MICKEY: Oh, you so are. <br>
ROSE: Mmm, must drive you mad. I'm surprised you don't give up on me. <br>
MICKEY: Oh, that's the thing, isn't it? You can rely on me. I don't go
changing my face. <br>
ROSE: Yeah. What if he's dying? <br>
MICKEY: Okay. <br>
ROSE: Sorry! <br>
MICKEY: Just let it be Christmas. Can you do that? Just for a bit. You
and me and Christmas. No Doctor, no bog monsters, no life or death. <br>
ROSE: Okay. <br>
MICKEY: Promise? <br>
ROSE: Yes! <br>
MICKEY: Right! What're you going to get for your mum? <br>
(They walk around the market.) <br>
MICKEY: I'm round there all the time now, you know. She does my dinner
on a Sunday, talks about you all afternoon, yap yap yap. <br>
(The band, which is wearing plastic masks, starts to follow them. Rose
notices. They stop playing and one fires a flame out of his trombone,
starting a panic. Mickey and Rose hide behind a stall. ) <br>
ROSE: It's us! They're after us! <br>
(The tuba fires a blast which demolishes a large tree, sending it
crashing onto him. Mickey and Rose flee.) <br>

got to get out. Where can we go? <br>

JACKIE: No, it's Christmas Eve! We're not going anywhere! What're you
babbling about? <br>

ROSE: That's a new tree. Where'd you get it? <br>
JACKIE: I thought it was you. <br>
ROSE: How can it be me? <br>
JACKIE: Well, you went shopping. There was a ring at the door, and
there it was! <br>
ROSE: No, that wasn't me. <br>
JACKIE: Then who was it ? <br>
(The tree lights up by itself and starts playing Jingle Bells.) <br>
ROSE: Oh, you're kidding me. <br>
(Sections of the tree start to rotate in different directions, creating
a strong wind. It starts to move, chopping through a coffee table.) <br>
MICKEY: Get out! Go, go! Get out! <br>
(Mickey picks up a chair to fend it off as Jackie and Rose run for the
door.) <br>
ROSE: We've got to save the Doctor. <br>
JACKIE: What're you doing? <br>
ROSE: We can't just leave him. <br>

across the door.) <br>
ROSE: Doctor, wake up! <br>
(Rose gets the sonic screwdriver from the jacket pocket and puts it in
the Doctor's hand. The tree smashes through the door.) <br>
JACKIE: I'm going to get killed by a Christmas tree! <br>
(Rose speaks into the Doctor's ear.) <br>
ROSE: Help me. <br>

explodes.) <br>

(The Doctor aims the screwdriver at them and the Santa's back away.
Then they are beamed away.) <br>
MICKEY: They've just gone. What kind of rubbish were they? I mean, no
offence, but they're not much cop if a sonic screwdriver's
going to scare them off. <br>
DOCTOR: Pilot fish. <br>
ROSE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: They were just pilot fish. <br>
(The Doctor is in pain.) <br>
ROSE: What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: You woke me up too soon. I'm still regenerating. I'm bursting
with energy. <br>
(He exhales the golden energy.)<br>
DOCTOR: You see? The pilot fish could smell it a million miles away. So
they eliminate the defence, that's you lot, and they carry me off. They
could run their batteries on me for a couple of ow! <br>

REPORTER [on TV]: Scientists in charge of Britain's mission to Mars
have re-established contact with the Guinevere One space probe. They're
expecting the first transmission from the planet's surface in the next
few minutes. <br>
LLEWELLYN [on TV]: Yes, we are. We're, we're back on schedule. We've
received the signal from Guinevere One. The Mars landing would seem to
be an unqualified success. <br>

tonight? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LLEWELLYN: Yes, we had a bit of a scare. Guinevere
seemed to fall off the scope, but it, it was just a blip. Only
disappeared for a few seconds. </font></p>

MICKEY: Here we go, pilot fish. Scavengers, like the Doctor said.
Harmless. They're tiny. But the point is, the little fish swim
alongside the big fish. <br>
ROSE: Do you mean like sharks? <br>
MICKEY: Great big sharks. So, what the Doctor means is, we had them,
now we get that. <br>
ROSE: Something is coming. How close? <br>
MICKEY: There's no way of telling, but the pilot fish don't swim far
from their daddy. <br>
ROSE: So, it's close? <br>
JACKIE: Funny sort of rocks. <br>

control, coming live from the depths of space on Christmas morning. <br>

and gurgles at the screen.) <br>

surface of Mars. Guinevere One was broadcasting from a point five
thousand miles above the planet. <br>
BLAKE: In other words, they've got a ship and the probe is on board. <br>
LLEWELLYN: But if they're not from the surface, then they might not be
from Mars itself. Maybe they're not actual Martians. <br>

ship was in flight when they just came across the probe. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: Where are we? <br>
MICKEY: We're just off Bloxom Road. We're just round the corner, we did
it! <br>
DOCTOR: Wait a minute, wait a minute. <br>
(The spaceship flies away.) <br>
MICKEY: Go on, my son! Oh, yeah! <br>
ROSE: Yeah! Don't come back! <br>
MICKEY: It is defended! <br>
(Rose and Mickey hug, then Rose hugs Alex.) <br>
HARRIET: My Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Prime Minister. <br>
(They hug.) <br>
HARRIET: Absolutely the same man. Are there many more out there? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, not just Sycorax. Hundreds of species. Thousands of them.
And the human race is drawing attention to itself. Every day you're
sending out probes and messages and signals. This planet's so noisy.
You're getting noticed more and more. You'd better get used to it. <br>
JACKIE: Rose! <br>
ROSE: Mum! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, talking of trouble. <br>
JACKIE: Oh, my God! You did it, Rose! Oh! <br>
(Alex answers a phone call.) <br>
ROSE: You did it too! It was the tea. Fixed his head. <br>
DOCTOR: That was all I needed, cup of tea. <br>
JACKIE: I said so. <br>
ROSE: Look at him. <br>
JACKIE: Is it him, though? Is it really the Doctor? Oh, my God, it's
the bleeding Prime Minister! <br>
DOCTOR: Come here, you. <br>
(Group hug.) <br>
JACKIE: Are you better? <br>
DOCTOR: I am, yeah. <br>
ALEX: It's a message from Torchwood. They say they're ready. <br>
JACKIE: You left me. <br>
ROSE: I'm sorry. <br>
JACKIE: I had all the food. <br>
HARRIET: Tell them to fire. <br>
ALEX: Fire at will. <br>
(Five green beams streak up into the sky, meet and fire out into space.
The Sycorax asteroid ship goes KaBOOM!) <br>
ROSE: What is that? What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: That was murder. <br>
HARRIET: That was defence. It's adapted from alien technology. A ship
that fell to Earth ten years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: But they were leaving. <br>
HARRIET: You said yourself, Doctor, they'd go back to the stars and
tell others about the Earth. I'm sorry, Doctor, but you're not here all
the time. You come and go. It happened today. Mister Llewellyn and the
Major, they were murdered. They died right in front of me while you
were sleeping. In which case we have to defend ourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: Britain's Golden Age. <br>
HARRIET: It comes with a price. <br>
DOCTOR: I gave them the wrong warning. I should've told them to run as
fast as they can, run and hide because the monsters are coming. The
human race. <br>
HARRIET: Those are the people I represent. I did it on their behalf. <br>
DOCTOR: Then I should have stopped you. <br>
HARRIET: What does that make you, Doctor? Another alien threat? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't challenge me, Harriet Jones, because I'm a completely new
man. I could bring down your Government with a single word. <br>
HARRIET: You're the most remarkable man I've ever met, but I don't
think you're quite capable of that. <br>
DOCTOR: No, you're right. Not a single word, just six. <br>
HARRIET: I don't think so. <br>
DOCTOR: Six words. <br>
HARRIET: Stop it! <br>
DOCTOR: Six. <br>
(The Doctor goes over to Alex and whispers in his ear.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you think she looks tired? <br>
(The Doctor, Rose, Mickey and Jackie leave.) <br>
HARRIET: What did he say? <br>
ALEX: Oh, well, nothing, really. <br>
HARRIET: What did he say? <br>
ALEX: Nothing. I don't know. <br>
HARRIET: Doctor! Doctor, what did you? What was that? What did he say?
What did you say, Doctor? Doctor! I'm sorry. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is picking himself a new outfit in the
Tardis wardrobe, and considers David's Casanova costume. We hear the
specially written Song For Ten by Murray Gold sung by Tim Phillips.) <br>
SINGER: When I woke up today and the world seemed a restless place, it
could have been that way for me. <br>
(Mickey, Rose and Jackie are back at the flat having Christmas dinner.
Mickey carves the turkey.) <br>
SINGER: Then I wandered around and I thought of your face that
Christmas looking back at me. <br>
(The Doctor finds a brown pinstripe suit and long brown coat. He leaves
the wardrobe past the old
hat stand with a long scarf on it.) <br>
SINGER: I wish today was just like every other day. Cause today has
been the best day. <br>
(The Doctor is back to a nice suit and tie after his recent
aberration.) <br>
SINGER: Everything I ever dreamed. Then I started to walk, pretty soon
I will run. And I'll be running back to you. Because I followed my
star, and that's what you are. I've had a merry time with you. <br>
(The Doctor enters. The dinner progresses to the crackers.) <br>
SINGER: I wish today was just like every other day. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's yours. <br>
ROSE: It's pink! Mum, it should be yours. Look, it's Harriet Jones. <br>
(That television is never switched off BBC24, it seems.) <br>
MAN [on TV]: Prime Minister, is it true you are no longer fit to be in
position? <br>
HARRIET [on TV]: No. Now, can we talk about other things? <br>
MAN [on TV]: Is it true you're unfit for office? <br>
(The Doctor puts on a pair of spectacles to watch the interview.) <br>
HARRIET [on TV]: Look, there is nothing wrong with my health. I don't
know where these stories are coming from. And a vote of no confidence
is completely unjustified. <br>
MAN [on TV]: Are you going to resign? <br>
(The telephone rings.) <br>
HARRIET [on TV]: On today of all days, I'm fine. Look at me, I'm fine.
I look fine, I feel fine. <br>
JACKIE: It's Beth. She says go and look outside. <br>
ROSE: Why? <br>
JACKIE: I don't know, just go outside and look. Come on, shift! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Powell Estate]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The ground is covered with white flakes falling
from the sky. Streaks of light
cris-cross the sky.) <br>
ROSE: Oh, it's beautiful. What are they, meteors? <br>
DOCTOR: It's the spaceship breaking up in the atmosphere. This isn't
snow, it's ash. <br>
ROSE: Okay, not so beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR: This is a brand new planet Earth. No denying the existence of
aliens now. Everyone saw it. Everything's new. <br>
ROSE: And what about you? What are you going to do next? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, back to the Tardis. Same old life. <br>
ROSE: On your own? <br>
DOCTOR: Why, don't you want to come? <br>
ROSE: Well, yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you, though? <br>
ROSE: Yeah! <br>
DOCTOR: I just thought, because I changed. <br>
ROSE: Yeah, I thought, because you changed you might not want me
anymore. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'd love you to come, <br>
ROSE: Okay. <br>
MICKEY: You're never going to stay, are you? <br>
ROSE: There's just so much out there. So much to see. I've got to. <br>
MICKEY: Yeah. <br>
JACKIE: Well, I reckon you're mad, the pair of you. It's like you go
looking for trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: Trouble's just the bits in-between. It's all waiting out there,
Jackie, and it's brand new to me. All those planets, and creatures and
horizons. I haven't seem them yet! Not with these eyes. And it is going
to be fantastic. <br>
ROSE: That hand of yours still gives me the creeps. <br>
(She takes hold of it anyway.)<br>
ROSE: So, where're we going to go first? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, that way. No, hold on. That way. <br>
(He points up.) <br>
ROSE: That way? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
ROSE: Yeah, that way.
