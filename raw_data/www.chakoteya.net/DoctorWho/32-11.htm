<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A lone policewoman walks the corridors of a
deserted hotel, then opens the door to room 214. There is a sad clown
in there, holding a balloon and sitting on the bed.) <br>
LUCY [OC]: My name is Lucy Hayward, and I'm the last one left. <br>
(Room 215 has an old-fashioned photographer with a girl and a birthday
cake.) <br>
LUCY [OC]: It's funny. You don't know what's going to be in your room
until you see it, then you realise it could have never been anything
else. <br>
(Further along is a second Room 214, and a gorilla comes out of the
bathroom. Lucy remembers some news reports, screams and backs out. She
writes in her notebook.) <br>
LUCY [OC]: The gaps between my worship are getting shorter. This is
what happened to the others. It's all so clear now. I'm so happy.
Praise him. Praise him. <br>
(Something big, heavy and snarling comes down the corridor. She stands
to meet it.) <br>
LUCY [OC]: Praise him. <br>
VOICE [OC]: Praise him.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Of the same hotel. The Tardis has parked herself
on the first floor landing of a staircase which winds its way up the
floors in a tight set of flights.) <br>
AMY: Let's go to Ravan-Skala, he says. The people are six hundred feet
tall. You have to talk to them in hot air balloons and the Tourist
Information Centre is made of one of their hats, he says. I'm sorry,
but I don't see any huge hats. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, Beaky, this could be the most exciting thing I have ever
seen. <br>
RORY: You're kidding. <br>
AMY: How can you be excited about a rubbish hotel on a rubbish bit of
Earth? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Reception]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Because, assembled Ponds, this is not
Earth. This has just been made to look like Earth. The craftsmanship
involved. Can you imagine? <br>
AMY: What? Then where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Something must have yanked us off course. Look at
the detail on that cheese plant! <br>
RORY: Right, but who would mock up an Earth hotel? <br>
(The Doctor finds an apple in a large bowl.) <br>
DOCTOR: Colonists maybe, recreating a bit of home, like when ex-pats
open English pubs in Majorca. No, whoever did this, I am shaking his
stroke her hand stroke tentacle. <br>
RORY: Have you seen these? Look at the labels underneath. <br>
(A set of photographs on the wall.) <br>
RORY: Commander Halke, defeat. <br>
(A Sontaran.) <br>
RORY: Tim Heath, having his photo taken. Lady Silver-Tear, Daleks. <br>
AMY: Paige Barnes, other people's socks. Tim Nelson, balloons. Novice
Prin, sabrewolves. Royston Luke Gold, Plymouth? Lucy Hayward, that
brutal gorilla. Doctor, what does it mean? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Let's find out. <br>
(He rings the bell on the desk and three people appear, two of them
brandishing objects as weapons, the third waving a white flag.) <br>
RORY: Whoa! <br>
DOCTOR: Blimey, that was a bit quick. <br>
GIBBIS: We surrender. <br>
(A grey alien with slightly rodent front teeth and no hair.)&nbsp;<br>
RORY: No, it's okay, we're not <br>
GIBBIS: We surrender. <br>
RORY: We're nice. <br>
DOCTOR: She's threatening me with a chair leg. <br>
RITA: Who are you? <br>
(Dressed in hospital scrubs.)&nbsp;<br>
HOWIE: Oh god, we're back in reception. <br>
(A bespectacled awkward teenager.)&nbsp;<br>
GIBBIS: We surrender. <br>
DOCTOR: I've never been threatened with a chair leg before. No, hang
on, I tell a lie. <br>
AMY: Did you just say, it's okay, we're nice? <br>
RITA: Okay, I need everyone to shut up, now. <br>
(Someone or something is watching on the CCTV.) <br>
HOWIE: Rita, be careful, yeah? <br>
RITA: Their pupils are dilated. They're as surprised as we are. Besides
which, if it's a trick, it'll tell us something. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you're good. Oh, she's good. Amy, with regret, you're
fired. <br>
AMY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm kidding. (silent) We'll talk. (normal) I take it from the
pathological compulsion to surrender, you're from Tivoli. <br>
GIBBIS: Yes. The most invaded planet in the galaxy. Our anthem is
called Glory To Insert Name Here. <br>
DOCTOR: You with the face, Howie, you said you were surprised to be
back in reception. <br>
HOWIE: The walls move. Everything changes. <br>
DOCTOR: You, clever one. What's he talking about? <br>
RITA: The corridors twist and stretch. Rooms vanish and pop up
somewhere else. It's like the hotel's alive. <br>
(The Doctor turns off the musak.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's quite enough of that. <br>
HOWIE: Yeah, and it's huge, with, like, no way out. <br>
RORY: Have you tried the front door? <br>
RITA: No. In two days it never occurred to us to try the front door.
Thank God you're here. <br>
(Amy laughs. The Doctor opens the front doors.) <br>
DOCTOR: They're not doors, they're walls. Walls that look like doors.
Door-walls, if you like, or dwalls. Woors even, though you'd probably
got it when you said they're not doors. I mean, the windows are <br>
(Pulls back the curtains to reveal more bricks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, big day if you're a fan of walls. <br>
RITA: It's not just that. The rooms have things in them. <br>
DOCTOR: Things? Hello! What kind of things? Interesting things? I love
things, ask anyone. <br>
RITA: Bad dreams. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that killed the mood. How did you get here? <br>
RITA: I don't know. I'd just started my shift. I must have passed out,
because suddenly I was here. <br>
HOWIE: I was blogging. Next thing, this. <br>
GIBBIS: Oh, I was at work. I'm in Town Planning. We're lining all the
highways with trees so invading forces can march in the shade. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
GIBBIS: Which is nice for them. <br>
ALL: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: So, what have we got. People snatched from their lives and
dropped into an endless, shifting maze that looks like a 1980s hotel
with bad dreams in the bedrooms. <br>
(The Doctor takes George's Rubik's cube from his pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, apart from anything else, that's just rude. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[First floor landing]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: We'll pop back to the Tardis, I'll do a
planet-wide diagnostic sweep, and then we'll have a sing song. <br>
AMY: Where's the Tardis? You parked it there, didn't you? <br>
HOWIE: What's a Tardis? <br>
RORY: Our way out. And it's gone. <br>
(The musak starts up again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, this is bad. At the moment, I don't know how bad, but
certainly we're three buses, a long walk and eight quid in a taxi from
good. Are there any more of you? <br>
RITA: Joe. But he's tied up right now. <br>
DOCTOR: Doing what? <br>
RITA: No, I mean he's tied up right now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Joe is tied to a chair. All the tables are
populated with ventriloquist's dummies, which are laughing. They fall
silent and look around as the Doctor enters, followed by Amy and Rory,
then the others.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor. <br>
JOE: We're going to die here. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they certainly didn't mention that in the brochure. Is
Joe there? Can I have a quick word? <br>
JOE: Oh, it's still me, Doctor, but I've seen the light. I lived a
blasphemous life, but he has forgiven my inconstancy, and soon he shall
feast. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you've been here two days. What's he waiting for? <br>
JOE: We weren't ready. We were still raw. <br>
DOCTOR: But now you're what, cooked? <br>
(The Doctor observes Joe's horseshoe tie clip and dice cufflinks.) <br>
JOE: If you like. Soon you will be, too. Be patient. First, find your
room. <br>
DOCTOR: My room. <br>
JOE: There's a room here for everyone, Doctor. Even you. <br>
DOCTOR: You said you'd seen the light now. <br>
JOE: Nothing else matters anymore. Only him. It's like these things. I
used to hate them. They make me laugh now. Gottle o' geer. Gottle o'
geer. <br>
(Laughter.) <br>
JOE: You should go. He'll be here soon. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you should come with me. <br>
(The Doctor slides a luggage trolley under Joe's chair.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Why you four? That's what I don't
understand. Aside from all the other things I don't understand. <br>
GIBBIS: What does it matter? Sooner or later, someone will come along
and rescue us. <br>
(He turns off the musak.) <br>
GIBBIS: Or enslave us. <br>
DOCTOR: First, we find the Tardis. Quick thing before we go. If you
feel drawn to a particular room, do not go in, and make sure someone
else can see you at all times. <br>
RITA: Joe said, he will feast. Is there something here with us? <br>
DOCTOR: Something to add, Joe? <br>
JOE: Here comes a candle to light you to bed. Here comes a chopper to
chop off your head. Chop, chop, chop, chop. <br>
HOWIE: Can we do something about him? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Joe's mouth has been taped shut, and Gibbis is
wheeling him along.) <br>
GIBBIS: Personally, I think you've got the right idea. Times like this,
I think of my old school motto. Resistance Is Exhausting. <br>
HOWIE: I've worked out where we are. <br>
RORY: Hmm? <br>
HOWIE: Norway. <br>
RORY: Norway? <br>
HOWIE: You see, the US government has entire cities hidden in the
Norwegian mountains. You see, Earth is on a collision course with this
other planet, and this is where they're going to send all the rich
people when it kicks off. <br>
RORY: Amazing. <br>
HOWIE: It's all there on the internet. <br>
RORY: No, it's amazing you've come up with a theory even more insane
than what's actually happening. <br>
(A man in his underwear and with a whistle around his neck steps out of
room 158.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
TEACHER: Have you forgotten your PE kit again? Right, that's it, you're
doing it in your pants! <br>
(And goes back inside the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hey! Don't! <br>
(Howie opens room 155. There are a lot of pretty girls there.) <br>
BLONDE: Oh, look, girls, it's H-H-H-Howie! <br>
BRUNETTE: What's loser in K-K-K-Klingon? <br>
HOWIE [OC]: Praise him. <br>
HOWIE: Shut the d, d, d, the door. This is just some m, m, messed up
CIA stuff, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you. <br>
DOCTOR: You're right. Keep telling yourself that. It's a CIA thing,
nothing more.

DOCTOR: No. No, I'm sure it isn't, but just in case, let's run away and
hide anyway. In here. <br>

DOCTOR: Amy, get back. Why haven't they got us yet? <br>

it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, they're not real. <br>

goes into the corridor. He sees a shadow turning the corner at the

RORY: If we can wedge a chair under the door handles, that should stop
anything from getting in. <br>
RITA: Help yourself to tea. Guys, tea over here. <br>
AMY: If it's any consolation, I've met the Weeping Angels, so I know
how. In fact, I thought that room was for me. <br>
GIBBIS: Joe was right. Whatever it is in here, it actually wants to
kill us. Not oppress us or enslave us, kill us! <br>
AMY: Listen. The Doctor's been part of my life for so long now, and
he's never let me down. Even when I thought he had, when I was a kid
and he left me, he came back. He saved me. And now he's going to save
you. But don't tell him I said that, because the smugness would be
terrifying. <br>
GIBBIS: Of course, if the Weeping Angels were meant for me, then your
room is still out there somewhere. <br>
RITA: Tea? <br>
RORY: Every time the Doctor gets pally with someone, I have this
overwhelming urge to notify their next of kin. (laughs then flinches)
Ooo. Sorry. The last time I said something like that, you hit me with
your shoe. And you literally had to sit down and unlace it first. <br>
RITA: What exactly happened to him? <br>
DOCTOR: He died. <br>
RITA: You are a medical doctor, aren't you? You haven't just got a
degree in cheese-making or something. <br>
DOCTOR: No! Well, yes, both, actually. I mean, there is no cause. All
his vital organs simply stopped, as if the simple spark of life, his
loves and hates, his faiths and fears were just taken, and this is a
cup of tea. <br>
RITA: Of course, I'm British, it's how we cope with trauma. That and
tutting. <br>
DOCTOR: But how did you make it? <br>
RITA: All hotels should have a well stocked kitchen, even alien fake
ones. I heard you talking when you arrived. Look, it's no more
ridiculous than Howie's CIA theory, or mine. <br>
DOCTOR: Which is? <br>
RITA: This is Jahannam. <br>
DOCTOR: You're a Muslim. <br>
RITA: Don't be frightened. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha! You think this is Hell. <br>
RITA: The whole '80s hotel thing took me by surprise, though. <br>
DOCTOR: And all these fears and phobias wandering about, most are
completely unconnected to us, so why are they still here? <br>
RITA: Maybe the cleaners have gone on strike. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha! I like you. You're a right clever clogs. But this isn't
Hell, Rita. <br>
RITA: You don't understand. I say that without fear. Jahannam will play
its tricks, and there'll be times when I want to run and scream, but
I've tried to live a good life, and that knowledge keeps me sane,
despite the monsters and the bonkers rooms. Gibbis is an alien, isn't
he? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Sorry. <br>
RITA: Okay. I'm going to file that under Freak Out About Later. <br>
AMY: Doctor, look at this. I found it in a corridor, I completely
forgot I had it. <br>
DOCTOR: (reads) Er, my name is Lucy Hayward and I'm the last one left.
It took Luke first. It got him on his first day, almost as soon as we
arrived. <br>
LUCY [OC] + DOCTOR: It's funny. You don't know what's going to be in
your room until you see it, then you realise it could never have been <br>
DOCTOR: Anything else. I just saw mine. It was a gorilla from a book
I'd read as a kid. My God, that thing used to terrify me. The gaps
between my worships are getting shorter, like contractions. <br>
LUCY [OC]: This is what happened to the others, and how lucky they
were. It's all so clear now. I'm so happy. Praise him. <br>
DOCTOR: Praise him. <br>
HOWIE: Praise him. <br>
DOCTOR: What did you just say? <br>
HOWIE: Nothing. Praise him! <br>
GIBBIS: This is what happened to Joe! <br>
HOWIE: God, it's going to come for me now. <br>
GIBBIS: You'll lead it right here. <br>
DOCTOR: I won't leave you. I promise you. You have my word on that. <br>
HOWIE: I don't want to get eaten. <br>
AMY: Calm down. <br>
GIBBIS: He's going to lead the creature right here! <br>
DOCTOR: Hold it! <br>
(He fires his sonic screwdriver to get silence.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
GIBBIS: Don't you see? He'll lead it right here. <br>
RITA: What do you suggest? <br>
GIBBIS: Look, whatever it is out there, it's obviously chosen Howard as
its next course. Now, tragic though that is, this is no time for
sentiment. I'm saying if it were to find him, it may be satisfied and
let the rest of us go. All I want to do is go home and be conquered and
oppressed. Is that too much to ask?! <br>
RITA: It's okay. I'll stay with Howie. You take the others and go. <br>
DOCTOR: No. We stay together. <br>
(He goes over to Gibbis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Your civilisation is one of the oldest in the galaxy. Now I see
why. Your cowardice isn't quaint, it's sly, aggressive. It's how that
gene of gutlessness has survived while so many others have perished.
Well, not today. No one else dies today. Right? Brilliant. Howie, any
second, it's going to possess you again. When it does, I'm going to ask
you some questions. Please try to answer them. <br>
HOWIE: I hope my mum's all right, she's going to be w, worried. <br>
DOCTOR: Howie? Howie. Howie, you're next. We're all dead jealous. So,
tell us. How do we get a piece of the action? Why isn't he possessing
all of us? <br>
HOWIE: You guys have got all these distractions, all these obstacles.
It'd be so much easier if you just let it go, you know? Clear the path.
<br>
AMY: You want it to find you even though you know what it's going to
do? <br>
HOWIE: Are you kidding? He's going to kill us all. How cool is that? <br>
(They leave Howie at the table.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's as I thought. It feeds on fear. Everything, the rooms,
Lucy's note, even the pictures in reception, has been put here to
frighten us. So we have to resist it. Do whatever you have to. Cross
your fingers, say a prayer, think of a basket of kittens, but do not
give in to the fear. <br>
AMY: Okay, but what are we actually going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: We're going to catch ourselves a monster. </font></p>

HOWIE: It's not like chucking me out of a plane to lighten the load.
I'm asking you for this. I'm begging you. <br>
GIBBIS: You're possessed. You'd say anything. <br>
HOWIE: Possessed guys can be quite strong. Who's to say I didn't
overpower you?

not ripe. This is what Joe said, that we weren't ready. So, what, what,
you make us ready. You what? Replace? Replace what, fear? You have

RORY: Well, after all the time I spent with you in the Tardis, what was
left to be scared of? <br>
DOCTOR: You said that in the past tense. <br>
RORY: No, I didn't. You know, Howie had been in speech therapy. He'd
just got over this massive stammer. What an achievement. I mean, can
you imagine? I'd forgotten not all victories are about saving the
universe. <br>

RITA: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Excellent question. Excellent question. Why what? <br>
DOCTOR: Why is it up to you to save us? That's quite a God complex you
have there. <br>
DOCTOR: I brought them here. They'd say it was their choice, but offer
a child a suitcase full of sweets and they'll take it. Offer someone
all of time and space and they'll take that, too. Which is why you
shouldn't. Which is why grown-ups were invented. <br>
RITA: All of time and space, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. And when we get out of this, I'll show you too. <br>
RITA: I don't know what you're talking about, but whatever it was, I
have a feeling you just did it again. <br>

RITA [on screen]: No, I need to get as far away from you all as
possible. <br>

praising it. <br>
RITA [on screen]: And then you'll put yourself in its way. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm coming to get you. Block out the fear and stay focused on
your belief. <br>
RITA [on screen]: The hotel will keep us apart. I could be fifty miles

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Gibbis is raiding the kitchen. Three bodies laid
out now. The Doctor is smashing breakables in frustration.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. It preys on people's fear and possesses them. But Rita
wasn't afraid. She was brave and calm. Maybe it's something to do with
the people, some connection between the four of you that'll tell me how
to fight it. <br>
GIBBIS: Yes, you keep saying that, but you never do. And while we wait,
people keep dying. And we'll be next. <br>
AMY: Look, he'll work it out. He always does. Just let him riff and
move anything expensive out of his way. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. Oh, no, no. <br>
AMY: Doctor, what is wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not fear. It's faith. Not just religious faith, faith in
something. Howard believed in conspiracies, that external forces
controlled the world. Joe had dice cufflinks and a chain with a
horseshoe. He was a gambler. Gamblers believe in luck, an intangible
force that helps them win or lose. Gibbis has rejected any personal
autonomy and is waiting for the next batch of invaders to oppress him
and tell him what to do. They all believe there's something guiding
them, about to save them. That's what it replaces. Every time someone
was confronted with their most primal fear, they fell back on their
most fundamental faith. And all this time, I have been telling you to
dig deep, find the thing that keeps you brave. I made you expose your
faith, show them what they needed. <br>
RORY: But why us? Why are we here? <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't want you. That's why it kept showing you a way out.
You're not religious or superstitious, so there's no faith for you to
fall back on. It wants her. <br>
AMY: Me? Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Your faith in me. That's what brought us here. <br>
RORY: But why do they lose their faith before they die and start
worshipping it? <br>
DOCTOR: It needs to convert the faith into a form it can consume. Faith
is an energy, the specific emotional energy the creature needs to live.
Which is why at the end of her note, Lucy said <br>
AMY: Praise him. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
RORY: No. Oh, please, no. <br>

thoughts. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't save you from this. There's nothing I can do to stop
this. <br>
AMY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I stole your childhood and now I've led you by the hand to your
death. But the worst thing is, I knew. I knew this would happen. This
is what always happens. <br>
(The Minotaur bursts in.) <br>
DOCTOR: Forget your faith in me. I took you with me because I was vain.
Because I wanted to be adored. Look at you. Glorious Pond, the girl who
waited for me. I'm not a hero. I really am just a mad man in a box. And
it's time we saw each other as we really are. <br>

morning. <br>
DOCTOR: It's both, actually. Yeah. Here we go. <br>
(He reads a holographic database.) <br>
DOCTOR: Distant cousin of the Nimon. They descend on planets and set
themselves up as gods to be worshipped. Which is fine, until the
inhabitants get all secular and advanced enough to build bonkers
prisons. <br>
RORY: Correction. Prisons in space. <br>
(He and Gibbis are looking down through a porthole.) <br>
AMY: Where are the guards? <br>
DOCTOR: No need for any. It's all automated. It drifts through space,
snatching people with belief systems and converts their faith into food
for the creature. <br>
GIBBIS: See that planet there? <br>
RORY: Which one? <br>
GIBBIS: There. The grey one there. <br>
RORY: Mmm hmm. <br>
GIBBIS: That's where I'm from. <br>
AMY: It didn't want just me, so you must believe in some god or
someone, or they'd have shown you the door too. So what do Time Lords
pray to? <br>
DOCTOR: According to the in-flight recorder, the programme developed
glitches. It got stuck on the same setting, the fears from the people
before us weren't tidied away. <br>
(The Minotaur growls.) <br>
AMY: What's it saying? <br>
DOCTOR: An ancient creature, drenched in the blood of the innocent,
drifting in space through an endless, shifting maze. For such a
creature, death would be a gift. Then accept it, and sleep well. I
wasn't talking about myself. <br>

inside lives a goblin, who feeds on indecision. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Real Earth, real house, real door keys. <br>
AMY: You're not serious? <br>
RORY: The car too? But, that's my favourite car. How did you know that
was my favourite car? <br>
DOCTOR: You showed me a picture of it once and said this is my
favourite car. <br>
AMY: Rory, can you give us two minutes? Two minutes? <br>
RORY: She'll say that we can't accept it because it's too extravagant
and we'll always feel a crippling sense of obligation. It's a risk I'm
willing to take. <br>
AMY: Hey. <br>
(The Doctor leans against the long red bonnet with Amy.) <br>
AMY: So. You're leaving, aren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: You haven't seen the last of me. Bad Penny is my middle name.
Seriously, the looks I get when I fill in a form, it's <br>
AMY: Why now? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you're still breathing. <br>
AMY: Well, I think this is about the washing up, personally. <br>
DOCTOR: I mean, you're right, there's still heaps of stuff out there to
look at. Do you know, there's a planet whose name literally translates
as Volatile Circus? Or maybe there's a bigger, scarier adventure
waiting for you in there. <br>
AMY: Even so, it can't happen like this. After everything we've been
through, Doctor. Everything. You can't just drop me off at my house and
say goodbye like we've shared a cab. <br>
DOCTOR: And what's the alternative? Me standing over your grave? Over
your broken body? Over Rory's body? <br>
AMY: If you bump into my daughter, tell her to visit her old mum
sometime. <br>
DOCTOR: And look after him. <br>
AMY: Look after you. Bye. <br>

of the house with champagne and glasses.) <br>
