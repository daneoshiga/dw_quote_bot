[OC]: This is the story of our planet, Earth. Of the day a thousand
years past when we came to share it with a race know as Humanity. It is
the story of the Doctor, who helped our races find common ground, and
the terrible losses he suffered. It is the story of our past and must
never be forgotten.

NASREEN: But Doctor, how can all this be here? I mean, these plants. <br>
DOCTOR: Must be getting closer to the centre of the city. <br>
NASREEN: You're sure this is the best way to enter? <br>
DOCTOR: Front door approach. Definitely. Always the best way. <br>

COMPUTER: Hostile life forms detected area seventeen. <br>
DOCTOR: Apart from the back door approach. That's also good. Sometimes
better. <br>
COMPUTER: Hostile life forms detected area seventeen. <br>
NASREEN: Doctor. <br>
(Warriors approach from both sides.) <br>

resistant to the cold than the male. <br>
AMY: I dressed for Rio! <br>
MO: Leave her alone. You've got me. <br>
(Amy's wrists are clamped tighter.) <br>
AMY: Argh. <br>

She frees herself, then Mo.) <br>

Any more of them, do you think? Do you think the Earth's been invaded? <br>
AMY: Don't know. But I know someone who could have some answers. We
need to get back to the surface and find him. I wonder where this
leads. <br>
MO: Maybe it's a way out of here. <br>
(Amy presses a button on a wall panel. A screen lights up, then the
area behind the door. It is a stasis alcove, and Elliot is inside.) <br>
MO: Oh, my God, no. <br>
AMY: What is it? <br>
MO: It's my son. It's Elliot. What've they done to him? He's in there.
We have to get him out. Elliot? Elliot, it's Dad. <br>
COMPUTER: Access denied. Unauthorised genetic imprint. <br>
AMY: Stop. Seriously, we can't get in. <br>
MO: That's my boy in there. <br>
AMY: These screens, they're monitoring something. I think they're vital
signs. Heartbeats, pulses. Why else would he be wired up? He's still
alive. <br>
MO: All right. We find weapons, get that creature from the lab and
force it to release Elliot, yeah? <br>
AMY: Yeah. Trust me. We'll get him out.

RORY: It was a misunderstanding. <br>
AMBROSE: Who are you? You and the Doctor? Why is this happening to us?
What did we ever do? <br>
RORY: The Doctor'll get your son back, I promise. In the meantime, we
take turns guarding the creature. <br>
AMBROSE: Oh, so that's it? We just sit and wait. <br>
RORY: And then we exchange her for your family. I promise you, Ambrose,
I trust the Doctor with my life. We stick to his plan. We keep that

remain under military guard. <br>
MALOHKEH: I'm sure you'd prefer to be in charge of everything and
everyone, Restac, but we rank the same. Is there any word from Alaya? <br>
RESTAC: No. <br>
MALOHKEH: It's fine to show concern, you know. She's part of your

you should have died. Why aren't you dead? Show me. <br>
(Mack shows her the green veins.) <br>
ALAYA: How does it feel, ape? <br>
MACK: Like it's burning in my blood. Please, if you help me, I can help
you. If you could cure me, I could help you escape. <br>
ALAYA: You see? You beg and offer betrayal so early. Why would I want
to escape when I can watch you die? The first ape death of the coming
war.

MALOHKEH: It's all right, it won't harm you. I'm only neutralising all
your ape bacteria. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not an ape. Look at the scans. Two hearts. Totally
different. Totally not ape! Remove all human germs, you remove half the
things keeping me alive. <br>
(Malohkeh turns off the decontamination machine.) <br>
RESTAC: No, complete the process. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's much better, thanks. Not got any celery, have you?
No. No, not really the climate. Tomatoes, though. You'd do a roaring
trade in those. I'm the Doctor. Oh, and there's Nasreen. Good. <br>
(Nasreen wakes.) <br>
NASREEN: Oh, a green man. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. Who are you? <br>
RESTAC: Restac, Military commander. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear, really? There's always a military, isn't there? <br>
MALOHKEH: Your weapon was attacking the oxygen pockets above our city. <br>
DOCTOR: Oxygen pockets, lovely. Ooo, but not so good with an impending
drill. Now it makes sense. <br>
RESTAC: Where is the rest of your invasion force? <br>
DOCTOR: Invasion force. Me and lovely Nasreen? No. We came for the
humans you took. And to offer the safe return of Alaya. Oh wait, you
and she, what is it, same genetic source? Of course you're worried, but
don't be, she's safe. <br>
RESTAC: You claim to come in peace, but you hold one of us hostage. <br>
DOCTOR: Wait, wait, we all want the same thing here. <br>
RESTAC: I don't negotiate with apes. I'm going to send a clear message
to those on the surface. <br>
DOCTOR: What's that? <br>

AMY: The Doctor would know. The Doctor always knows. <br>
MO: Hey, look. <br>
(Above the two Silurians are tunnels heading straight up.) <br>
AMY: Wait. I've got it. It's how they came up to the surface. Some sort
of powered transport discs. It's our way out of here. <br>
MO: Even better. Weapons. Come on, now we can fight back. <br>
(They take the Silurian disc weapons from the warriors and back out of
the chamber. Amy switches it off.) <br>

DOCTOR: These must be the only ones awake. The others must still be in
hibernation. <br>
NASREEN: So, why did they go into hibernation in the first place? <br>
DOCTOR: Their astronomers predicted the planet heading to Earth on a
crash course. They a built life underground and put themselves to sleep
for millennia in order to avert what they thought was the apocalypse,
when in reality it was the moon coming into alignment with the Earth. <br>
MALOHKEH: How can you know that? <br>
DOCTOR: Long time ago, I met another tribe of Homo Reptilia. Similar,
but not identical. <br>
RESTAC: Others of our species have survived? <br>

AMBROSE: What? <br>

AMBROSE: No, it's about your grandson. If you won't do it for me, do it
for Elliot. I know I did wrong, but I can't lose him, Dad.

MO: If you've harmed him in any way. <br>
MALOHKEH: Of course not. I only store the young. <br>
DOCTOR: But why? <br>
MALOHKEH: I took samples of the young, slowed their lifecycles to a
millionth of their normal rate so I could study how they grew, what
they needed, how they lived on the surface. <br>
DOCTOR: You've been down here working by yourself, all alone? <br>
MALOHKEH: My family, through the millennia, and for the last three
hundred years, just me. I never meant to harm your child. <br>
DOCTOR: Malohkeh, I rather love you. <br>
MALOHKEH: It's safe. We can wake him. <br>

ELLIOT: Dad. <br>

ELLIOT: Where are we? <br>
MO: Well, I've got to be honest with you, son. We're in the centre of
the Earth, and there are lizard men. <br>
MALOHKEH: Hi. <br>
ELLIOT: Wow. <br>
DOCTOR: Elliot. I'm sorry. I took my eye off you. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ELDANE: We lived on the surface of the planet long
before you did. Our sole purpose has been to return to our rightful
place. <br>
NASREEN: And we've got a planet that can't already sustain the people
who live there. And you want to add a whole other species to drain
resources <br>
ELDANE [OC]: As I sat there that day across the table from the humans,
the future of both species and of our beloved planet Earth rested in
our hands. But as the discussions went on, I began to despair about
whether we would ever find any common ground. As ambassadors for our
species we all had too much to lose. <br>
AMY: So, what about the areas that aren't habitable to us? Australian
outback, Sahara desert, Nevada plains. They're all deserted. <br>
NASREEN: Yes, fine, but what happens when their population grows and
breeds and spreads? And anyway, what benefit does humanity get, and how
will we ever sell this to people on the surface? <br>
ELDANE: If I could get a word in, maybe I could tell you. You give us
space, we can bring new sources of energy, new methods of water supply,
new medicines, scientific advances. We were a great civilisation. You
provide a place for us on the surface, we'll give you knowledge and
technology beyond humanity's dreams. If we work together, this planet
could achieve greatness. <br>
NASREEN: Okay. Now I'm starting to see it. <br>
AMY: Oh yeah. <br>
(The Doctor enters with Mo and Elliot.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not bad for a first session. More similarities than
differences. <br>
ELDANE: The transport has returned. Your friends are here.

a chance but you were so much less than the best of humanity. <br>
(Restac and her troops march in.) <br>
RESTAC: My sister. Oh. And you want us to trust these apes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: One woman. She was scared for her family. She is not typical. <br>
RESTAC: I think she is. <br>
DOCTOR: One person let us down, but there is a whole race of dazzling,
peaceful human beings up there. You were building something here. Come
on. An alliance could work. <br>
AMBROSE: It's too late for that, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
AMBROSE: Our drill is set to start burrowing again in fifteen minutes. <br>
NASREEN: What? <br>
MACK: What choice did I have? They had Elliot. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't do this. Don't call their bluff. <br>
AMBROSE: Let us go back. And you promise to never come to the surface
ever again. We'll walk away, leave you alone. <br>

DOCTOR: Tony Mack. Sweaty forehead, dilated pupils. What are you
hiding? <br>
(The green veins are all across his chest.) <br>
NASREEN: Tony, what happened? <br>
MACK: Alaya's sting. She said there's no cure. I'm dying, aren't I? <br>
DOCTOR: You're not dying, you're mutating. <br>
MACK: How can I stop it? <br>
DOCTOR: Decontamination program. Might work. Don't know. Eldane, can
you run the program on Tony? <br>
MO: Doctor, shedload of those creatures coming our way. We're
surrounded in here. <br>
DOCTOR: So, question is, how we do stop the drill given we can't get
there in time? Plus, also, how do we get out, given that we're
surrounded? Nasreen, how do you feel about an energy pulse channelled
up through the tunnels to the base of the drill? <br>
NASREEN: To blow up my life's work? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Sorry. No nice way of putting that. <br>
NASREEN: Right, well, you're going to have to do it before the drill
hits the city, in er <br>
AMY: Eleven minutes forty seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Squeaky bum time. <br>
NASREEN: Yes, but the explosion is going to cave in all the surrounding
tunnels, so we have to be out and on the surface by then. <br>
RORY: But we can't get past Restac's troops. <br>
ELDANE: I can help with that. Toxic Fumigation. An emergency failsafe
meant to protect my species from infection. A warning signal to occupy
cryo-chambers. After that, citywide fumigation by toxic gas. Then the
city shuts down. <br>
AMY: You could end up killing your own people. <br>
ELDANE: Only those foolish enough to follow Restac. <br>
DOCTOR: Eldane, are you sure about this? <br>
ELDANE: My priority is my race's survival. The Earth isn't ready for us
to return yet. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
AMY: Ten minutes, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: But maybe it should be. So, here's a deal. Everybody listening.
Eldane, you activate shutdown. I'll amend the system, set your alarm
for a thousand years time. A thousand years to sort the planet out. To
be ready. Pass it on. As legend, or prophesy, or religion, but somehow
make it known. This planet is to be shared. <br>
ELLIOT: Yeah. I get you. <br>
AMY: Nine minutes, seven seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Fluid controls, my favourite. Energy pulse. Timed, primed
and set. Before we go, energy barricade. Need to cancel it out quickly.
<br>
ELDANE: Fumigation pre-launching. <br>
RORY: There's not much time for us to get from here to the surface,
Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha, super-squeaky bum time. Get ready to run for your lives.
Now. <br>
