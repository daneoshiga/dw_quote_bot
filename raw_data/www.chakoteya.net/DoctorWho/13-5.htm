looks of it, crawls through some ruins towards a small craft with a
bubble dome. A humanoid with a hook instead of one hand watches, draws
a knife then pounces. The alien squeals as it is stabbed.) </font></p>

Madoc</a> is putting the final touches to a bust he is sculpting
when the man with the hook enters carrying something covered in a
sack.) <br>
SOLON: You were quick, Condo. Were there no survivors? <br>
CONDO: One, an oxygen breather. <br>
SOLON: Humanoid? Excellent. Let me see. <br>
(Solon takes the sacking off the item to reveal the insectoid's head.) <br>
SOLON: No, that won't do. Even if the ganglia could be. No, the
cranium's too narrow, the cerebrum undeveloped. That is an insect! Even
a half-witted cannibal like you can see it won't do! <br>
CONDO: But the big head's not come, master. Not to Karn. <br>
SOLON: It must, Condo. One day, a true humanoid species, warm blooded,
with a central nervous system. One such specimen, just one, and I can
complete my work here. </font></p>

Doctor rushes out. Thunder rolls.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come out, meddlesome, interfering idiots. I know you're up
there so come on out and show yourselves! <br>
(Sarah sneaks out cautiously with a torch.) <br>
DOCTOR: Messing about with my Tardis. Dragging us a thousand parsecs
off course. <br>
SARAH: Oi, have you gone potty? Who are you shouting at? <br>
DOCTOR: The Time Lords, who else? Now, you see? You see? They haven't
even got the common decency to come out and show their ears. <br>
SARAH: They're probably afraid of getting them boxed, the way you're
carrying on. <br>
DOCTOR: It's intolerable. I won't stand for any more of it. <br>
SARAH: Oh look, why can't it have just gone wrong again? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
SARAH: The Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Do you think I don't know the difference between an
internal fault and an external influence? Oh, no, no, no. There's
something going on here, some dirty work they won't touch with their
lily white hands. Well, I won't do it, do you hear! <br>
(Thunder rolls in reply.) <br>
SARAH: There's something ominous. Where are we, do you think? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know and I don't really care. <br>
SARAH: Oh, come on. Come on, stop being so childish. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm just going to sit here and do nothing. <br>
SARAH: So there. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(Sarah spots the insectoid's spacecraft.) <br>
SARAH: Look, Doctor. Oh, come on, have a look at it. I mean, you don't
know what you might be missing. Well, do you know what it is? <br>
(The Doctor plays with his yoyo.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Ejection bubble. <br>
SARAH: A what? <br>
DOCTOR: A space parachute. <br>
SARAH: Pardon? <br>
(She climbs onto the ruins to get a better look around.) <br>
SARAH: Hey, Doctor, quick. Come and look at this! There must be about a
dozen wrecked spaceships out there. It's like the Sargasso Sea. <br>
DOCTOR: Fancy. <br>
SARAH: It's incredible. I mean, why should they all have crashed here? <br>
DOCTOR: I've no idea. <br>
SARAH: Well, I think you should take a look. Coming? <br>
DOCTOR: No, thanks. I'm just going to sit here and practise my double
loops. <br>
SARAH: Well, please yourself. I'm going anyway. Are you sure? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(Sarah leaves. The Doctor goes over to the Tardis and wipes some dirt
off its notice board. Then Sarah screams. He runs over to the ruins
where she is kneeling by the remains of the insectoid.) <br>
SARAH: I suppose it was the crash? <br>
DOCTOR: Not the crash. Afterwards. <br>
SARAH: After? So it was deliberate? <br>
DOCTOR: Looks as if he escaped in the ejection bubble, and while he was
wandering around dazed someone or something attacked him. Poor Mutt. <br>
SARAH: Mutt? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, a mutant insect species. Widely established in the Nebula
of Cyclops. I thought I recognised the stars. <br>
SARAH: You've been here before? <br>
DOCTOR: I was born in these parts. <br>
SARAH: Near here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, within a couple of billion miles, yes. <br>
SARAH: Hey, look! <br>
(The lightning reveals Solon's castle nearby, looking like a basilica
with lots of flying buttresses.) <br>
SARAH: Come on. At least it's civilisation. <br>
(It starts to rain. Sarah tries to cover her head with her quilted
jacket, while the Doctor puts up a broken umbrella.) <br>
SARAH: Oh god. Come on. <br>

to one of his contraptions, and puts electrical currents through it.
The eyes move, then the mandibles. He notes the results.) <br>
SOLON: Motor reflexes seven tenths. <br>
(A lightning strike blows out his power supply. He lights a candle.) <br>
SOLON: Condo! Condo, fetch some lamps. <br>
(He goes to the door.) <br>
SOLON: Condo! <br>

lab.) </font></p>

MAREN: Two of them? <br>
OHICA: A male and a female, Maren, in the valley below. <br>
MAREN: Our senses reach beyond the five planets. They were not <br>
OHICA: They are here. <br>
MAREN: No ship can approach Karn without detection. Even the silent gas
dirigibles of the Hoothi are felt in our bones while still a million
miles distant. <br>
OHICA: There was no ship, Maren. The last was the cruiser of the Mutts.
<br>
MAREN: Then how? How, Ohica? <br>
OHICA: I do not know. I say only what my eyes have seen. <br>
MAREN: Is it as I feared? For months now I have had a dream that the
Elixir of Life would be taken from us. <br>
OHICA: Taken? <br>
MAREN: Next to myself, Ohica, you are the oldest of our sisterhood.
Come, let me show you. <br>
(They cross the room to an oval metal panel set partway up the wall.
Maren unlocks the clasp and opens it to reveal a flame flickering in a
rock alcove. Below it is a goblet.) <br>
OHICA: The Flame of Life! Maren, what is wrong? Why is it so low? <br>
MAREN: The Flame dies, Ohica. Every month, every day, it sinks lower. <br>
OHICA: How can this be? At our ceremonies the Flame has burned
brightly, higher than my shoulder. <br>
MAREN: A deception. For many months past, before each ceremony, I have
secretly fed the Flame with powdered Rine Weed. <br>
OHICA: But if the Flame dies, there will be no more Elixir. <br>
MAREN: It has been low now for over a year. The vessel remains empty. <br>
OHICA: Then we are doomed. Our sisterhood will perish. <br>
MAREN: We are only servants of the Flame. If the Flame dies, then so
must we. <br>
(Maren closes the panel and locks it again.) <br>
OHICA: Maren, should not the others know? <br>
MAREN: Not until the end is certain. As you know, Ohica, the secret of
the Life Elixir is known only to our sisterhood and the High Council of
the Time Lords. Since the time of the stones we have shared the Elixir
with them. Now there is none to share. <br>
(Ohica helps Maren back to her throne.) <br>
MAREN: The few phials that are left I have kept for ourselves. But for
months I have felt the Time Lords would come to rob us of these last
precious drops. <br>
OHICA: You think the two I saw have been sent to steal the Elixir? <br>
MAREN: If that is so, we must deal with them. Summon our sisters. We
will form a circle. </font></p>

SOLON: Where have you been? <br>
(Condo is on an upper level.) <br>
CONDO: Master. <br>
SOLON: I asked you, you stupid ox, where have you been? (Condo comes
down the stairs.) <br>
CONDO: I go find food, master. <br>
SOLON: You're lying. You can't deceive me, Condo. You've been looking
for that arm again, haven't you. I've told you before. You get the arm
back when our task here is finished. You serve me well and I'll put it
back as neatly as I took it off. But if you fail me, you'll keep this
for the rest of your life. Do you understand? <br>
CONDO: Yes, master. <br>
(A bell rings.) <br>
CONDO: The door. Somebody ring. <br>
SOLON: Answer it, you fool. <br>
(Condo opens the door to reveal the Doctor and Sarah.) <br>
DOCTOR: Can you spare a glass of water? <br>
SARAH: Can we come in? <br>
SOLON: Humans. At last. Humans! <br>
(Solon goes to greet them.) <br>
SOLON: My dear sir. My dear, dear sir. You have no idea what a pleasure
this is. It's so long since we've. Condo, take their clothes. <br>
SARAH: Well, if we could just shelter for a while, that would be fine. <br>
SOLON: Great heavens, you can't go walking on a night like this. I
wouldn't dream of letting you proceed one step further. Condo, stir
yourself. Our guests are cold and tired and wet and. Let me take your
hat, sir. There. Oh. What a magnificent head. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
SOLON: Superb head. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad you like it. I have had several. I used to have
an old grey model before this. Some people liked it. <br>
SARAH: I did. <br>
SOLON: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I said, some people liked it, but I prefer this model. <br>
SOLON: Forgive me. What a surly host you must think me. Please, come
in, come in. Make yourselves at home. Warm yourselves and sit down.
Condo, pour the wine. <br>
SARAH: Oh, it's very kind of you. Thank you. <br>
SOLON: Not at all, not at all. It's an honour to offer you whatever
comforts my humble abode can provide. As you see, the amenities here
are rather antiquated. <br>
SARAH: Oh, no, I think it's very <br>
DOCTOR: Interesting. <br>
SARAH: Oh, yes, yes. <br>
SOLON: Well then, tell me, tell me about your adventures. <br>
(They all sit at a round table in front of the log fire.) <br>
SOLON: It's so rare that anyone arrives here on Karn. <br>
DOCTOR: Karn, is it? I should have known. <br>
SOLON: You mean you arrived here without knowing? <br>
SARAH: Oh well, we often go on a sort of mystery tour, don't we,
Doctor? Doctor? <br>
(The Doctor is staring over his shoulder at the mystery bust, now in
darkness. <br>
DOCTOR: You seem very keen on heads, Mister er. <br>
SOLON: Solon. <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Solon. <br>
SOLON: Mehendri Solon. <br>
DOCTOR: It's very good. <br>
(The Doctor goes over to the bust and Solon follows.) <br>
SOLON: Yes, I. Modelling is one of my hobbies, you know, but
unfortunately this is not a very good example. <br>
(Solon covers the bust with a cloth.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, I thought I recognised the face. <br>
SOLON: No. <br>
DOCTOR: No? <br>
SOLON: You made a mistake. <br>
(They return to the table.) <br>
DOCTOR: Talking of heads, or their absence, we found a headless body
lower down the mountain. <br>
SOLON: How distressing. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it was. <br>
SOLON: It must have been from one of those crashed spacecraft, no
doubt. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's another thing. How many did we count, Sarah? <br>
SARAH: Fifteen. <br>
DOCTOR: Fifteen. The wreckage of fifteen ships all in this one area. <br>
SOLON: There's a belt of magnetic radiation. <br>
DOCTOR: Magnetic radiation? <br>
SOLON: Oh, I don't know anything about it, but I believe that is the
theory. In fact, Karn has become quite notorious. <br>
(Condo brings a tray with goblets and a jug, bowls and a plate of
food.) <br>
SOLON: Ah, here we are. Now, let's hope that Condo has brought
something special. Thank you. Condo, how many times have I told you the
wine must be opened and allowed to breathe. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, please, please. <br>
SOLON: No, no, no. So would you please do as you've been instructed?
Hurry. <br>
(Condo leaves with the jug.) <br>
SOLON: He's an excellent fellow, very devoted to me, but his
intelligence is not the highest. <br>
SARAH: What happened to his arm? <br>
SOLON: Oh I, er, many years ago I dragged him from the wreck of a
Dravidian starship and his arm? Well, amputation was the only way of
saving his life. <br>
(Solon serves up the food in the bowls.) </font></p>

raised circular dais as she gazes into the large stone on her ring.) <br>

SISTERS: Sacred. <br>
MAREN: I see it. <br>

MAREN: Enough. Enough. It is done. <br>
(They all go over to the Tardis and hold their hands an inch away from
its surface.) <br>
MAREN: I was right, Ohica. It is a time machine. <br>
OHICA: Of the kind <br>
MAREN: A Tardis. Only the Time Lords know the secret of such machines. <br>
OHICA: Then the one I saw is a Time Lord. <br>
MAREN: Sent here to steal the Elixir. <br>
OHICA: Maren, what can we do? Alone among all the races in our galaxy,
the Time Lords are our equals in mind power. <br>
MAREN: That is true, Ohica. Other races we can destroy from within. We
can place death in the centre of their beings, send them mad with false
visions. But with this one such powers would have no effect. He would
close his mind to us. <br>
OHICA: Then we are lost! <br>
MAREN: There are other ways. But first we must find him. Form a circle,
sisters. <br>
(They return to the dais.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Condo brings the open jug of wine.) <br>
SOLON: One never really overcomes the nostalgia for one's planet of
origin. Sometimes at night I look up at the sky and I think, will I
ever see Earth again? <br>
SARAH: I know the feeling. <br>
DOCTOR: What made you settle on Karn? <br>
SOLON: Well, nobody lives here. Nobody bothers me. I can get on with my
work. <br>
SARAH: What kind of work is that? <br>
DOCTOR: Microsurgical techniques into tissue transplant. It was the
title of the book you published. <br>
SOLON: You know something of my history, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: One of the foremost neurosurgeons of your time. Considerably
after your time, Sarah. Yes, your disappearance caused quite a stir. It
was said by some you'd joined the followers of the cult of Morbius. <br>
SOLON: Malice. Academic jealousy. I just had to get away. <br>

looking.) <br>
SOLON: You know, I always knew that one day I'd have a guest with a
head for such a fine vintage. <br>
(Suddenly, the doors blow open and the wheel chandelier crashes to the
floor. The cloth is ripped away from the bust and the fire is blown
out. The doors slam shut again. Sarah comes out from underneath the
table.) <br>
SARAH: What was that? <br>
SOLON: Oh, just a freak squall. <br>
DOCTOR: Or a telekinetic visit. <br>
SOLON: What? <br>
DOCTOR: From the Sisterhood of Karn. <br>
SOLON: What do you know of the Sisterhood? <br>
(The Doctor drunkenly taps the side of his nose and turns to look at
the bust. He stands.) <br>
DOCTOR: I know who that reminds me of now. One of the Time Lords.
Morbius. <br>
(The Doctor staggers slightly.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor, are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: One of the most despicable criminally minded wretches that ever
lived. <br>
(The Doctor sits down again then passes out.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
SOLON: There are some of us who would not agree with that, Doctor. <br>
(Sarah slumps back in her chair, unconscious.) <br>
SOLON: It worked, Condo. He is ours! <br>
CONDO: We take head now? <br>
SOLON: You put that away. This will be no crude butchery. A head such
as this, a head that will soon command the universe, must be taken with
care and skill. Every step must be planned. Every suture, every small
incision has to be perfect. This will be my great triumph, Condo. A
thousand years from now, people will remember Solon's last and greatest
operation. <br>
(He measures the Doctor's head.) <br>
CONDO: Not last, master. Me last. <br>
SOLON: What? <br>
CONDO: Arm. You made promise. <br>
SOLON: Any third rate hack can fix an arm, but a head, the centre of
the nervous system, that takes more than just skill. That takes genius.
<br>
CONDO: Girl. <br>
SOLON: What girl? <br>
CONDO: Her. <br>
SOLON: Kill her. <br>

SOLON: Condo! I am anxious to get on. Now take him to the laboratory. I
want to start my work. <br>

wooden stethoscope.) <br>
SOLON: A secondary cardiovascular system. So he's a Time Lord. I
thought as much. That's excellent, because we have no problem of tissue
rejection. <br>
CONDO: Time Lord dangerous. <br>
SOLON: What? <br>
CONDO: Much power, master. <br>
SOLON: Rubbish! The Time Lords are spineless parasites. Morbius offered
them greatness once but he was betrayed and rejected. They'll pay for
that mistake, Condo. These pacifist degenerates will be the first to
feel the power of his revenge. <br>
(Solon puts a scalpel against the Doctor's throat. Meanwhile, Sarah is
searching the corridors. Condo brings a trolley of surgical
implements.) <br>
SOLON: What's that for? Do you think I'm going to operate in this
light? We need proper lighting and power for the instruments, so we
have to repair the generators. Come. <br>

how? And where? That drug. Did you put it all into the wine? <br>
CONDO: Yes, master. All little bottle in big. <br>
SOLON: Then he must still be unconscious. He can't have moved. That
squalid brood of harpies, the Sisterhood. That accursed hag Maren found
I was holding a Time Lord and rescued him. May her stinking bones rot!
I'll see her die, Condo. I'll see that palsied harridan scream for
death before Morbius and I are finished with her. <br>
CONDO: What do? <br>
SOLON: We must get the Doctor back. We must! <br>
CONDO: Sisters see much, master. See with mind. <br>

blink recently. <br>

quaint. Now, if you got yourself a decent forklift truck <br>

prattling nonsense or confess your guilt. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, I have but a little time left? <br>

your death will be made easy. <br>

DOCTOR: How did I get that impression? <br>
MAREN: The Time Lords destroyed Morbius for his crimes here on Karn. <br>
DOCTOR: Solon had a clay model of his head. But it was more than that.
A living mental contact. I felt the mind of Morbius. <br>
OHICA: Morbius was executed for leading the rebellion. His body was
placed in a dispersal chamber and atomised to the nine corners of the
universe. <br>
DOCTOR: I know that. But I tell you, Maren. Just for a second, before I
passed out, his mind touched mine. I felt his burning hatred and
anguish. Morbius is alive. <br>
MAREN: I suppose you think raising these old fears can somehow help
you, but I was present at his execution. Morbius is dead, Doctor, and
you will join him very shortly. </font></p>

MAREN: With your spoken confession, the Time Lords can never deny they
plotted against the Sisterhood. <br>
DOCTOR: Plotted against you? You've got it wrong, matron. <br>
MAREN: Nevertheless <br>
DOCTOR: Nevertheless nothing. For years, the Time Lords have extended
their friendship towards the Sisters. When Morbius and his rebels
overran this planet, who was it saved you? <br>
MAREN: The Time Lords acted then as they do now, from self-interest.
They too feared Morbius. They too depended on the Elixir of Life for
their survival. <br>
OHICA: And now the Elixir no longer forms, you Time Lords want for
yourselves the little that remains. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, the Elixir no longer forms? <br>
OHICA: The Sacred Flame dies. <br>
DOCTOR: How can it? That flame is the product of gases forcing up along
a geological fault from deep in the molten heart of the planet. It will
burn for millions of years. <br>
MAREN: It dies. <br>
DOCTOR: Unless some subterranean movement. Have you noticed any tremors
recently? <br>

from you, would I come in through the front door? <br>
MAREN: Then why did you come to Karn if not to steal? <br>
(The Doctor removes the net.) <br>
DOCTOR: I can't answer that question, Maren, until I know what Solon
intends, but I have a feeling something incredibly evil is brewing. <br>
OHICA: Nothing happens on Karn without our knowledge. <br>
DOCTOR: A Time Lord could live on Karn without your knowledge. He could
place a barrier around his mind. <br>
MAREN: What are you suggesting? <br>
DOCTOR: Morbius was a Time Lord. <br>
MAREN: Oh, that name again. I tell you, I saw his execution. I saw his
body placed in the dispersal chamber. Nothing of Morbius, not the
smallest atom, still exists. <br>
DOCTOR: Was Solon living on Karn at the time? <br>
MAREN: I believe so. There were many on Karn then. They came from all
across the galaxy to attend the trial of Morbius. <br>
DOCTOR: A war criminal. A ruthless dictator, but with millions of
fanatical followers and admirers. <br>
MAREN: Riff-raff and mercenaries. The army he brought to Karn was the
scum of the galaxy. <br>
OHICA: He promised them the Elixir of Life and immortality. <br>
MAREN: Morbius betrayed our secret. Until then, only the Time Lords
knew of the Elixir. Now we have to remain constantly on guard against
the entire cosmos. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's something else I want to mention. You really
can't go on dragging innocent space travellers to their deaths. <br>
MAREN: Innocent? <br>
DOCTOR: Until proved guilty. Those spaceships might just be passing.
No, if I'm going to help you, I must insist upon one thing. <br>
MAREN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Wrecking of spaceships has got to stop. Agreed? </font></p>

with rising superheated gases and you have your Elixir. The impossible

MAREN: Do not try to understand mysteries beyond the reach of the mind.

Maren. One could probably synthesise that stuff by the gallon, though
the consequences would be appalling. <br>
OHICA: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: What? Everyone trying to live forever? No. Death is the price
we pay for progress, you know. <br>
MAREN: You speak in riddles, Doctor. The Time Lords were glad enough of
the Elixir. <br>
DOCTOR: Only in rare cases. When, for instance, there's some difficulty
in regenerating a body. We don't take it regularly like you, otherwise
we'd fall into the same trap. <br>
MAREN: And what trap are we in? <br>
DOCTOR: Immortality. You must have been old when the Elixir was
discovered. How many centuries have passed while you have remained
unchanged. How long since anything here changed? <br>
MAREN: Nothing here ever changes. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly my point. No progress. Please, stand back. <br>

MORBIUS: Why? <br>
SOLON: Because there were too many problems. Formidable problems. There
was no way of eliminating the build-up of static electricity within the
cranial cavity. Periodically it would have earthed through the brain,
upsetting the delicate equilibrium, dislocating the neural centres. <br>
MORBIUS: But you made a braincase. <br>

SARAH: Sonic screwdriver. <br>
DOCTOR: It's in the Tardis. <br>
SARAH: Oh. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Solon's lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Solon has the braincase open, and is working on
the connections to the body.) <br>
SOLON: This time, Morbius, there'll be no mistakes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Shrine]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> OHICA: Is it right that we should let the Doctor
fight our battles for us? <br>
MAREN: What are you saying? <br>
OHICA: Morbius is our enemy also. <br>
MAREN: There is no proof. No proof, Ohica, that the brain of Morbius
still survives. That was simply the Doctor's theory. <br>
OHICA: One that makes meaning of Solon's meaningless work. And Solon
himself is evil. The blood of our sister Kelia stains his hands. <br>
MAREN: Away from the Flame our powers fade. Even if the Doctor is
right, there is little we can do to help. <br>
OHICA: We should do the little we can. If the Doctor faces both Solon
and Morbius then <br>
MAREN: Ohica, I am too old. Too old and weak to leave the Shrine. I
could not lead you. <br>
OHICA: Then let me, High One. Give the order and let me lead the
Sisterhood. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Basement]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SARAH: There must be something we can do. It's not
like you to give up. I mean, Solon has got to be stopped, hasn't he? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a thousand tons of reinforced concrete between us and
Solon's laboratory. I know these places. Hydrogen plants are all built
to the same basic design, the Scott Bailey principle. I've got an idea.
<br>
SARAH: I knew you would. <br>
DOCTOR: Solon must've kept the brain alive in a colloidal nutrient.
Hydrogen cyanide, Sarah. Hydrogen cyanide. <br>
SARAH: Hydrogen cyanide. <br>
(They search the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: HCN. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: HCN. <br>
SARAH: Ah ha! HCN. <br>
(Sarah holds up a small bottle.) <br>
DOCTOR: Prussic acid. Good girl. <br>
SARAH: So what do we do now, drink ourselves to death? What are you
looking for? If you tell me, I can help you. Is it big, is it small?
What is it? <br>
(The Doctor kicks over a side table to reveal a small ventilation duct
in the wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: I knew there'd be one. <br>
SARAH: Oh, come on. We're not going to get out through there. <br>
DOCTOR: That isn't the idea. That duct should lead to Solon's
laboratory. <br>
SARAH: Are you suggesting I crawl <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm not. <br>
SARAH: Then what? <br>
DOCTOR: We've got all we need to make cyanogen. <br>
(The Doctor starts pouring liquids into a kidney bowl.) <br>
DOCTOR: Cyanogen. Just a drop, two, three. <br>
(He puts the bowl into the duct.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stand back, Sarah. I mean well back. <br>
SARAH: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: If we can create the right combustion conditions <br>
(He pours the Prussic acid into the mix and retreats as it produces a
gas.) <br>
DOCTOR: Something should happen. <br>
(Upstairs, Solon is closing up the braincase as the gas starts to drift
in through a vent.) <br>
SARAH: How do we tell if it's worked? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if we're still here in a month <br>
SARAH: It hasn't worked. <br>
DOCTOR: Correct. <br>
SARAH: Hmm. How many hours in a month? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Solon's lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SOLON: I've done it. Morbius, I've done it.
(coughs) You will live. You will (cough) You will live again. <br>
(Solon clutches his throat and falls across Morbius' body. Morbius sits
up and he falls to the floor.) <br>
MORBIUS: Cyanide. <br>
(He sees the gas coming from the vent.) <br>
MORBIUS: Ah. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Basement]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ohica leads the Sisterhood through the rocks.) <br>
SARAH: How many seconds in a month? <br>
DOCTOR: Two million six hundred and seventy eight thousand four
hundred. <br>
(Morbius makes a noise behind them.) <br>
SARAH: Short month. <br>
MORBIUS: An ingenious idea, Doctor, but ineffectual. Your poison
affected only Solon. I have the lungs of a birastropthe. <br>
DOCTOR: With a methane filter. What does it feel like to be the biggest
mongrel in the universe? <br>
MORBIUS: Solon designed this body for efficiency, not for its
appearance. To be free again is all that matters. <br>
DOCTOR: Free to cause more havoc, more destruction? <br>
MORBIUS: The Time Lords will not oppose me again, nor the Sisterhood.
When it is learnt that I, Morbius, have returned from the grave, my
followers will rise in their millions. <br>
DOCTOR: You really can't go on calling yourself Morbius. There's very
little of Morbius left. Why don't you think of another name? Potpourri
would be appropriate. <br>
SARAH: How about Chop Suey? <br>
MORBIUS: What! <br>
DOCTOR: Chop Suey, the galactic emperor. <br>
MORBIUS: You will be the first to die. <br>
DOCTOR: Brain getting a little overheated, is it? Careful, not as
strong as it was. <br>
MORBIUS: My brain functions perfectly. <br>
DOCTOR: I doubt it, Morbius. All that time in a tank, it's gone soft.
Do you dare put it to the test? <br>
MORBIUS: What test? <br>
DOCTOR: We have all the apparatus here. I challenge you to a
mind-bending contest. <br>
MORBIUS: I am a Time Lord of the first rank. What are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing, nothing. A mere nobody, but I don't think you're
in the first rank any more. <br>
MORBIUS: Very well, Doctor. If that is how you want to die, I accept
your challenge. <br>
DOCTOR: There's sporting gentleman. <br>
SARAH: What's mind-bending? <br>
DOCTOR: Time Lord wrestling. It's usually a game but it can end in
death lock. <br>
MORBIUS: It will, Doctor. I, Morbius, do not play games. <br>
DOCTOR: Neither do I. Are you ready? <br>
(There is a tall piece of metalwork with a circular piece at head
height. The Doctor and Morbius place their foreheads against armatures
at head height which are connected to the circle by wires.) <br>
DOCTOR: En garde, Morbius. <br>
(The Doctor switches it on. The circle fills with images, first of
Morbius and how he originally looked, then the Doctor and his previous
incarnation.) <br>
MORBIUS: Is your mind, Doctor, going? <br>
SARAH: Doctor. <br>
MORBIUS: How far, Doctor? How long have you lived? <br>
(Patrick and Bill, then a man with a moustache, someone with a powdered
wig.) <br>
MORBIUS: Your puny mind is powerless against the strength of Morbius. <br>
(More faces, including a William Shakespeare lookalike. Presumably
these are Morbius' previous appearances.) <br>
MORBIUS: Back. To. The. Beginning! <br>
(Then there is a bang inside his braincase and it fills with smoke.
They both disconnect, and Morbius staggers away. The Doctor falls
sideways.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor? <br>
(Morbius leaves while Sarah waves smelling salts under the Doctor's
nose. <br>
The Sisterhood enters the parlour as Morbius comes up the stairs. They
brandish their torches at him and drive him outside. Ohica takes the
opportunity to go down to the basement. She finds Sarah cradling the
Doctor's head.) <br>
OHICA: What has happened? <br>
SARAH: I think he's dying. <br>
(The Sisterhood drive Morbius up the rocks and over a cliff. It is a
long way down.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Shrine]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MAREN: The Time Lord dies. Only the Elixir of Life
can save him. <br>
OHICA: And we have none. <br>
(Maren goes to the Flame and opens the cover.) <br>
SISTERS: Sacred Flame. Sacred fire. Sacred Flame. Sacred fire. <br>
(Maren takes the goblet.) <br>
MAREN: Enough has formed, Ohica. Enough for the Doctor. <br>
OHICA: But High One, your own need. <br>
MAREN: Here, take it. Perhaps the Doctor was right. There should be an
end. <br>
(Maren turns to the Flame, and Ohica pours the Elixir into the Doctor's
mouth. He sits up, then lies back again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nectar? Stewed apricots. No custard. Ah! <br>
OHICA: Maren! <br>
(The old woman is sitting in the Flame. As they stare, she turns into a
young woman before vanishing completely.) <br>
DOCTOR: Was that the last? <br>
SARAH: Without it, you would have died. <br>
OHICA: It was ordained. <br>
DOCTOR: And Morbius? <br>
OHICA: He is destroyed. We owe you thanks, Doctor, <br>
DOCTOR: Oh please, Ohica, please, no speeches of gratitude. Sarah and I
have an engagement. <br>
SARAH: We have? <br>
DOCTOR: Come along. <br>
SARAH: Thank you, Ohica. <br>
(The Doctor gives Sarah the key and she opens the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Sisters. Oh, in case you have trouble with the
chimney. <br>
(He hands her two flash-bangs.) <br>
OHICA: What are they? <br>
DOCTOR: A might atom and a thunder flash. <br>
(He goes into the Tardis.) <br>
OHICA: There is some ancient writing here, Doctor. Is it a Time Lord
spell? What does it say? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Light the blue touch paper and stand clear. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises with a bang and flash.) </font> </p>
