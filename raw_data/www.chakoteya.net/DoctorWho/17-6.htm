note - Shada (pronounced Shah-da) was not fully made, due to union
action at the BBC, and never broadcast apart from the sequence of the
Doctor and Romana punting on the River Cam and a bit of chase scene
which was used in the Five Doctors.) The existing footage was <a href="17-6v.htm"><font color="#000000">released
on videotape </a>with linking narration by Tom Baker filmed in the Doctor
Who area of the Museum Of The Moving Image, which sadly closed in 1999. <br>

<u><i><b>Part One</b></i></u>
<p><b>[FSAS Space Station]</b>
<p>
(Inside a space station hanging by a red giant
star, six men dressed in white sit in recliners with their heads
towards a central device with a globe on it. Very Alien. A monitor
starts counting down in roman numerals, from XXX. One of the men is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623762/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Christopher
Neame</a>, who is dressed slightly differently from the others,
and has a nasty scar down his right cheek. When the countdown finishes,
his eyes open. Another count begins, this time going upwards. The other
five men start jerking in their seats while our man gets up and goes to
a wall panel, where he presses some buttons. The countdown reverses back up to XXX. The men stop jerking, and
voices begin whispering. Eventually they become still. Our man walks to
a control console and flicks some more switches. A male voice comes from the
speakers.) <br>
COMPUTER [OC]: This is a recorded message. The Foundation for the Study
for Advanced Sciences is under strict quarantine. Do not approach. Do
not approach. Everything is under our control. <br>
(The man holds up his hand, and the sphere from the top of device rises
into the air and glides into it. He leaves. The computer repeats its
message as the man goes into the shuttlebay. Then the five remaining
men jerk briefly and get up. They stagger around then fall down as a
spaceship undocks and flies away.)

removes the gown to reveal a slightly tatty jacket underneath. His
study is lined from floor to ceiling with bookshelves, and the tables
are also loaded with volumes. A police telephone box sits somewhat out
of place amongst it all. The Professor looks at it, then goes and draws
his curtains. There is a knock at the door.)&nbsp;<br>

CHRONOTIS [OC]: Tea? <br>
PARSONS: Oh, thanks. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Just put the kettle on. <br>
PARSONS: Er, Professor Chronotis, I don't know if you remember me. We
met at a faculty party a few weeks ago. It's Chris Parsons. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, of course. Enjoy these faculty dos, do you? <br>
PARSONS: Well, you know, it's <br>
CHRONOTIS: A lot of boring old dons talking away at each other, who
never listen to a word anybody else says. <br>
PARSONS: No, well, you said that <br>
CHRONOTIS: Talk, talk, talk. Never listen. <br>
PARSONS: No, well, er, look, I hope I'm not taking up any of your

CHRONOTIS: Time? Oh no. When you get to my age, you'll find that time
doesn't matter too much. Not that I expect you'll get to my age. <br>
PARSONS: Oh, really? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh, yes. I remember talking to the last Master of College but
one, or was it the last Master but two? Could have been three. <br>
PARSONS: Three? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes, nice young chap. Died rather tragically at the age of
oh. Run over by a coach and pair. <br>
PARSONS: What was it you said to him? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh, I don't know. Long time ago, you know. <br>
PARSONS: Yes. Professor, when we met you were kind enough to say that
if I dropped round you would lend me some of your books on carbon
dating. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, of course. Happy to. Ah, there's the kettle. <br>
(Chronitis disappears into the kitchen.) <br>
PARSONS: Professor? <br>
CHRONOTIS: You'll find the books you want at the far end of this bookshelf. Third shelf down. <br>
(He goes back into the kitchen.) <br>
PARSONS: Thanks. <br>
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Or is it the second shelf down? Second, I think. Anyway, take what you want. Milk? <br>
PARSONS: Oh, yes please. <br>
CHRONOTIS [OC]: One lump or two? <br>
PARSONS: Two please. <br>
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Sugar? <br>
(Chronotis enters with two china cups of tea on a tray.) <br>
CHRONOTIS: Ah, Here we are. <br>
(Parsons tucks his three selected books under his arm and looks at his wrist
watch.) <br>
PARSONS: Oh, actually Professor, I've just realised I'm going to be
really late for a seminar. Look, I'm terribly sorry. Look, I'll bring
these back to you next week, all right? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes, of course. Goodbye. <br>
(Chronotis takes his newly purchased slim paperback out of its plastic bag.) <br>
PARSONS: Goodbye. Actually, Professor, could I just ask you, where did
you get that? <br>
(He points to the Tardis.) <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh, I don't know. I think someone must have left it there
when I was out. <br>
PARSONS: Yes, well, I'll bring these back as soon as I can. <br>
(Parsons leaves. Chronotis settles down to read his Pan paperback copy of The Time Machine by H G Wells.)

is reading a book.) <br>
DOCTOR: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvel, Judge
Jefferies, Owen Chadwick. <br>
ROMANA: Who? <br>
DOCTOR: Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes. Some of the greatest labourers in the
history of Earth have thought here. <br>
ROMANA: Newton, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, definitely Newton. <br>
ROMANA: For every action, there is a equal and opposite reaction. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. <br>
ROMANA: So Newton invented punting. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius. <br>
ROMANA: Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so <br>
DOCTOR: Restful? <br>
ROMANA: No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in
the other. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, the colours. <br>
DOCTOR: It's October. <br>
ROMANA: I thought that you said we were coming here for May week. <br>
DOCTOR: I did. May week's in June. <br>
ROMANA: I'm confused. <br>
DOCTOR: So was the Tardis. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing
can go wrong. No coordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just
the water, a punt, a strong pair of hands and the pole. <br>
(Whereupon the pole gets stuck in the mud of the riverbed and the
Doctor has to let it go. They drift on under a bridge.) <br>
ROMANA: The pole. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, I think it's about time that we go and see if the Professor
is back in his room. Ask me how. <br>
(The man from the spacestation watches them drift under the bridge. He
has a large carpet bag with him, and has acquired a large white hat and
cloak to complete a Renaissance look.) <br>
ROMANA: How? <br>
DOCTOR: For every reaction there is an opposite and equally different
action. <br>
(The whisper of many voices is briefly heard before he walks away.) <br>
ROMANA: Did you just heard voices? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>

(Parsons places one of the books on top of two others - Hypnosis And The Law and Zaphod: My Stories. It slides off them onto the table. 
He opens it to discover it is written in an alien script. The time on the clock flies back and forth as he riffles through the pages, 
ending up where it started when he closes the book. He sniffs the book, then feels the cover and opens it. But when he reaches for a 
magnifying glass it snaps itself shut again. He tries stabbing it with a scalpel, but it moves out of the way of the blade.)

ROMANA: Saint Cedd? <br>

WILKIN: Good afternoon, Doctor. <br>

WILKIN: Why, yes, of course, sir. An honorary degree in 1960. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but how kind of you to remember me. <br>
WILKIN: That's my job, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: And you do it splendidly. Now <br>
WILKIN: Professor Chronotis, sir? He returned to his room a few minutes
ago. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh good, good, good. Wilkin, how did you know I wanted to speak
to Professor Chronotis? <br>
WILKIN: Because that's who you asked for when you were here in 1964,
1960 and 1955, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Did I really? I was here in 1958. <br>
WILKIN: Were you, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but in a different body. <br>
WILKIN: (laughs) Yes, sir. <br>

CHRONOTIS: Oh, delighted, delighted. I've heard so much about you. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you really? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Well, not yet, but I will have done. When Time Lords get to
my age they tend to get their tenses muddled up. Would you liked some
biscuits too? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't have said no. <br>

are being enjoyed.) <br>

CHRONOTIS: Yes, my dear. <br>
ROMANA: And in the same set of rooms? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Ever since I retired from Gallifrey. <br>
ROMANA: Didn't anybody notice? <br>
CHRONOTIS: One of the delights of the older Cambridge colleges.
Everyone is so discreet. Now Doctor, young fellow, what can I do for
you? <br>
DOCTOR: What can you do for me? You mean what can I do for you? You
sent for me. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Sent for you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we got your signal. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Signal? What signal? <br>
DOCTOR: Romana, didn't we get a signal from the Professor, would we
come as soon as possible? <br>
ROMANA: Yes. We come straight away. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, when I was on the river I heard a strange babble of
inhuman voices, didn't you, Romana? <br>

trying to have it banned. <br>

I'd escape, and then where would you be? <br>

(The sphere pins her to the doors. She notices that the time rotor stops when Skagra ceases to turn pages. Then he notices it too.)<br>
SKAGRA: Exactly. Time runs backwards over the book. As I turn the pages within the time field of this machine, the machine operates. 
Turning the last page will take us to Shada.

PARSONS: Who are they? What are they, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Victims of Skagra's brain drain. Their intellectual powers have
been stolen. But their memory patterns might remain. Yes. <br>
(The Doctor sits in one of the central seats.) <br>
PARSONS: But if only they could tell us what happened to them. <br>

DOCTOR: So do I. So do I. Now, take a deep breath. <br>
(The Doctor goes to the free-standing console and adjusts the controls,
then goes to a wall panel and cranks up the power. The pyramid between
the seats begins to twinkle, and Parson's head is pulled back between
the receptors. The Doctor checks the lifesigns of the man, who then touches his head, making him jump.) <br>

CALDERA: There's A S T Thira, the psychologist. G V Centauri, the

DOCTOR: Some of the greatest intellects in the universe. <br>
CALDERA: And Doctor Skagra. <br>
DOCTOR: Skagra? <br>
CALDERA: Geneticist, and astro-engineer. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
CALDERA: And cyberneticist, and neurostructuralist, and moral theologian. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and too clever by seven-eighths. Who is he? Where does he
come from? <br>
CALDERA: We don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
CALDERA: But he was very impressive. He offered very handsome fees, so
we agreed. <br>
DOCTOR: To do what? <br>
CALDERA: Don't you see? The Think Tank was his idea. He set it up. <br>
DOCTOR: He did? To do what? <br>
CALDERA: The pooling of intellectual resources by electronic mind
transference. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
CALDERA: He conceived it on the grand scale. Just how grand, we didn't
realise. Not at first, not until after we had built the sphere, and by
then it was too late. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? What happened? <br>

PARSONS: I feel marvellous! <br>

CLARE: Oh. Look, I don't even know what I'm meant to be doing. <br>
CHRONOTIS: We must get this old perambulator moving again. <br>
CLARE: Well, it certainly moved when I touched it. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh, a spasm, a mere spasm. I just hope it wasn't a dying
spasm, because it has left us jammed between two irrational time
interfaces. Time is moving away from us. If we do manage to disentangle
ourselves, I'll just have to be careful, otherwise I shall cease to
exist again. <br>
CLARE: Oh. Really? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Now do as I do. <br>
CLARE: What's that? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Forget about it. <br>
CLARE: Oh, Professor, that's easier said than done. Who is this, er,
Salyavin person? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Salyavin? He was a criminal. His exploits have been wildly
exaggerated. He was a hotheaded, brilliant young man with a peculiar
talent. I can't fix this. <br>
CLARE: Can I help? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Difficult, very difficult. To repair an interfacial
resonator requires two operations which must be performed absolutely
simultaneously. And to be honest, my dear, I don't think you have the
knowledge. <br>
CLARE: So we're stuck. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes. <br>
CLARE: Well, I can learn, you know. I'm very quick. <br>
(Chronotis fetches a large wrench from the kitchen.) <br>
CLARE: What's the matter? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. What I am about
to do, you are never to speak of, and this is the only time I will ever

CHRONOTIS: Do I have your promise? <br>
CLARE: Well, what are you going to do to me? <br>

(Chronotis puts down the wrench and takes off his spectacles. His eyes glow as he stares
hard into Clare's eyes.) <br>
CHRONOTIS: Now, what is that piece of equipment? <br>
CLARE: This? Er, it's a conceptual geometer relay, with an agronomic
trigger, a totally defunct field separator. But it doesn't matter. We
can dispense with it if we can get that interfacial resonator working

SKAGRA: Oh, you stole my ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Only after you stole mine. Ah, there she is. I hope you've been looking after her. If you've been over-revving her... <br>
SKAGRA: I'm curious to know how you survived the attentions of my sphere. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it only looks for what it expects to find. I made it look for the wrong things. <br>
SKAGRA: If you've come here in the hope of interfering with my great purpose. <br>
DOCTOR: Great purpose? Great purpose? Ha! <br>
SKAGRA: The very greatest purpose, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: You want to take over the universe, don't you. I've met your sort before. Any moment now a mad gleam will come into one of your eyes and 
you'll start shouting, the universe shall be mine. <br>
SKAGRA: How naive, Doctor. How pathetically limited your vision must be. <br>
DOCTOR: Limited? <br>
SKAGRA: Take over the universe? How childish. Who could possibly want to take over the universe? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. That's what I keep telling people. It's a troublesome place, difficult to administer. And as a piece of 
real estate, it's worthless, because by definition there'd be no one to sell it to. <br>
SKAGRA: Such visions are for infants. My purpose will fulfil the natural evolutionary goal of all life. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes? <br>
SKAGRA: With the aid of these spheres, I shall make the whole of creation merge into one single mind, one god-like entity. <br>
DOCTOR: You will? <br>
SKAGRA: The universe, Doctor, shall not, as you so crudely put it, be mine. The universe shall be me. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Have you discussed this with anyone? I mean, why don't you send one of your rocky pals off to make some tea and we can sit down and 
chew on a macaroon. <br>
SKAGRA: Doctor, your inane whitterings do not interest me. This will happen. It will start within hours. And once it has started, nothing 
you or anyone else can do will stop it. Take them away. They bore me. <br>
(Krargs bear down. The Doctor taps one.) <br>

CHRONOTIS: It's strictly unofficial. I'm not really allowed to have one. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and what better way to hide it than by living in it, you old sly boots. <br>
CLARE: What are you doing here? <br>
PARSONS: How am I'm suppose to know. Yeah, and what's the Professor's room doing here? <br>
CLARE: Oh, you may well ask. But ask the Professor. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Doctor, where is Skagra? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Not so loud. He's just outside. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: He's got Romana, he's got the Tardis, he's got the book. I thought you were dead, Professor. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes, so did I. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you really? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Listen, Doctor, if Skagra has the Tardis and the book, he can get to Shada. <br>
DOCTOR: Shada? Shada? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes, the Time Lords' prison planet. You've probably forgotten about it. <br>
DOCTOR: I never forget anything. I never forget. Well, that's right. I have forgotten. The Time Lords' prison planet. Now why would I have
forgotten? Got it. Of course! Salyavin was imprisoned on Shada. Yes. Ask me who Salyavin is. <br>
CLARE: Oh, now he was a great criminal imprisoned centuries ago by the Time Lords. <br>
DOCTOR: A great criminal. Unique mental powers. He had the ability to project his mind into other minds, completely take them over, didn't he, Professor? <br>
PARSONS: That's what Skagra's doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no, no. Quite the opposite. Skagra had the capacity to take minds out of people, but he can't put minds back
into them. That's why he needs Salyavin in the sphere, and that's why he's going to Shada. <br>
PARSONS: Of course! <br>
CHRONOTIS: Doctor! He must not get there.

DOCTOR: With Skagra's mind and Salyavin's in the sphere, Skagra will be omnipotent. <br>
PARSONS: What, you really mean he could just move himself into every mind in the universe? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, eventually. It might take thousands of years, but that wouldn't matter. His mind's immortal. It would spread like a
disease. <br>
PARSONS: It's quite a thought though, isn't it? I mean, every mind working together as a single organism, a single mind. <br>
DOCTOR: Skagra's mind. Not a pleasant thought. <br>
CLARE: Doctor, we've got to stop him from getting to Shada. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. But how? He's got a start on us and we don't know where it is. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Then we must follow him. <br>
PARSONS: But how? <br>

DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Just believe me. All the minds that
Skagra's stolen are now in the melting pot along with his own, and
operating as one. And with the Professor's, I mean with Salyavin's mind

SKAGRA: We will return to the carrier ship. From there a fleet of small craft will take each one of you to selected centres 
of population, and then the great mind revolution shall begin. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.)
<p> <b>[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]</b>
<p>
DOCTOR: It'll be tricky. <br>
ROMANA: And dangerous. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a touch. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, it'll be terribly, terribly dangerous for you. You'll
stand about as much chance as <br>
DOCTOR: As what? <br>
ROMANA: As a. There isn't anything that stands as little chance as you
will out there. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'll just have to be, I'll just have to be very
brave, won't I. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, it isn't funny. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, I can do your part if you can do mine. <br>
ROMANA: I'll try. <br>
DOCTOR: You're a hero. Remember? Clare? <br>
CLARE: Yes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on very tight. <br>
(The Door appears in the Vortex next to the Tardis. The Doctor and Romana operate Chronotis's Tardis controls
simultaneously.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ready? <br>
ROMANA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Clare? <br>
CLARE: Ready, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold tight. Now!<br>
(A green light reaches out from the Door to the Tardis) <br>
DOCTOR: Ha ha! Got them. Well done, Romana. <br>
ROMANA: We haven't got to the hard bit yet. <br>
DOCTOR: No, we haven't got long. Clare? <br>
CLARE: Yes, Doctor, I'm holding on. <br>
DOCTOR: Come over here and hold on to this, then. <br>
(Clare takes hold of the very long lever.) <br>
DOCTOR: And whatever you do, don't let go, because we are in for a
very, very rough ride. <br>
(A short time later.) <br>
DOCTOR: And twenty thirdly, out there in the space-time vortex, time
and distance have no meaning, but here in this little, little room <br>
ROMANA: Oh, get on with it, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Romana? <br>
ROMANA: Yes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I want you to switch off the vortex shields in this small area
here. <br>
(He indicates somewhere near the kitchen with the toasting fork.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, you can do it. I showed you how to do it. Just one
little bit of timelessness and spacelessness over there behind the tea
trolley. <br>
(Romana makes careful adjustments. The area wibbles and the tea trolley
rolls across the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: I said behind the tea trolley, not in the middle of it. <br>
ROMANA: I'm sorry, but it's very difficult. <br>
DOCTOR: Focus it! Now just one steady line, eh? One. Steady. Hold it.
Hold it! <br>
ROMANA: I'm trying, Doctor. I'm trying! <br>
DOCTOR: Phew. Right. Now this is a little trick I learnt from a
space-time mystic in the Quantocks. He made it seem very, very easy. <br>
(The Doctor walks forward and vanishes.) <br>
CLARE: Oh! He did it! <br>
ROMANA: Hold that switch down! <br>
(The Doctor is crawling through the green light between the two time capsules.) <br>
ROMANA: It won't hold much longer. It's fading even faster than the
Doctor said it would. K9. K9, wake up and come here. <br>
(Clare and Romana swap levers so that Romana can open the cupboard
underneath the console.) <br>
ROMANA: Check out the subneutron circuits. <br>
K9: Detect circuit malfunction, mistress. <br>
(The Doctor is nearly at the Tardis.) <br>
K9: Impossible to effect repair in time available, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: Well, hold it, K9. Stop it deteriorating. <br>
K9: Impossible to stop it, mistress. I can only slow down circuit
deterioration. <br>
ROMANA: The Doctor needs every second we can give him. <br>
CLARE: This switch is getting very hot. <br>
ROMANA: You must hold it down. <br>
CLARE: But I can't. It's getting hotter. <br>
(The Doctor is starting to to slide backwards.)<br>
CLARE: It's burning me. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, hold it down with a pencil. <br>
CLARE: But I haven't got one. <br>
(Romana tries to reach one on a pile of papers whilst hanging on to the
long lever.) <br>
ROMANA: I can't reach it. <br>
CLARE: Oh. Well, here, hold this. <br>
(Clare releases her switch and the console goes bang! The girls are
thrown across the room.) <br>
K9: It's broken. <br>
(The link between the time machines is gone. They whirl off through the Vortex, and so does the Doctor. Romana bandages Clare's burnt hand.) <br>
CLARE: What about the Doctor? <br>
ROMANA: I don't know. It was a very dangerous idea trying to make that
crossing. He didn't get as much time as he wanted. I just don't
know. <br>
CLARE: What should we do? <br>
ROMANA: Well, we'll just go ahead as planned. There. How's that? <br>
CLARE: Oh, it's fine, thank you. It wasn't a bad burn. Look, do you think
the Doctor will be all right? <br>
ROMANA: We'll just go ahead as planned. <br>
K9: Repairs completed, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: Let me see. Good boy, K9. Now we can go. Though I dread to
think what we're walking into if. Oh, well, let's just do it.
<p>
<b>[Workshop]</b>
<p>
(The Doctor tumbles into a room. There are racks of odds and ends against the wall, including a Cyberman's head. He starts to collect bits and pieces.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Good. Good. 
<p>
<b>[Command ship]</b>
<p>
(The Tardis materialises.) <br>
SKAGRA: And soon, an infinite consort of the mind.
<p>
<b>[Tardis]</b>
<p>
(The Doctor sneaks into the console room with a helmet device he has made in his own workshop.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, old girl. How've you been keeping? Sorry I had to barge in through your back door like that, 
but if you had any idea what it's like to travel through the Space-Time Vortex... Ha, ha, of course you do. 
Silly me. You do it all the time. But at least you're built for it. Now, let's see what's happening outside, shall we? <br>
(The scanner shows Skagra and his crew standing outside the Door to Chronotis's Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look out behind you! Let's go and say hello. <br>
(The Doctor opens the Tardis doors and blows on a dog whistle.)
<p>
<b>[Command ship]</b>
<p>
SKAGRA: Out you come, Doctor. Out you come. <br>
(The Door opens with a creak and K9 comes out.)<br>
SKAGRA: He sends his dog out to face me. <br>
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis and walks up behind Skagra.)<br>
SKAGRA: Stop hiding in there, Doctor. Come out and meet your fate. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
SKAGRA: Doctor! How did you get in there? <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, how did I get in there. It's mine, I belong in there. <br>
SKAGRA: As of now, Doctor, you don't belong anywhere at all. There is no place for you in my universe. You shall die. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Skagra, that's a very interesting theory. (puts on helmet) Let's try putting it to the test, shall we? <br>
(He turns the helmet on and stares at Skagra. The prisoners also stare at Skagra.) <br>
SKAGRA: Doctor, what have you done? <br>
(The prisoners advance on Skagra. He concentrates hard and they turn towards the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, what have you done? You've used that deranged billiard ball once too often. You forget, there's a copy of my brain in there too, eh? 
Think about it. <br>
(The prisoners advance on Skagra again, then get a little confused.)<br>
DOCTOR: But not too hard, old chap. You might strain yourself. A new universe, a new single mind. Ha. I think your little bunch are in 
two minds about that one already. <br>
(Skagra clicks his fingers and a Krarg moves towards the Doctor. The Doctor is blocked by the prisoners.) <br>
DOCTOR: K9! <br>
K9: Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Fire! <br>
(K9's laser heats up the Krarg.)<br>
DOCTOR: Now, lay on, Skagra. Let's see the quality of your mind. <br>
(The two men concentrate.)<br>
DOCTOR: A little warm for the time of year, wouldn't you say, Skagra? Off, K9. <br>
(The super-heated Krarg staggers backwards.)<br>
SKAGRA: Not that way. The other way, you fool. The other way! Back! <br>
(Two more Krarg approach K9 from the rear.)<br>
DOCTOR: K9! <br>
(K9 turns and heats them up too. The first Krarg has entered the chamber where it was first created. Romana pushes it into a vat, where it sizzles. 
Then she stands one of the other vats upright and pulls two wires from the wall.) <br>
ROMANA: Clare! Clare! <br>
(Clare opens the Door as the prisoners back the Doctor up against a wall. Romana talks to her behind Skagra's back.) <br>
DOCTOR: K9, stop firing. <br>
ROMANA: Now! <br>
(Clare and Romana drop the live wires onto the floor. The electricity surges through the hot Krarg and they explode. The Doctor 
gets the prisoners to move on Skagra again.)<br>
DOCTOR: You want to call half-time, Skagra? You can have a short break if you like, suck a lemon. Perk you up no end. <br>
(Skagra runs for his life.) <br>
SKAGRA: Ship! Take off instantly. Instantly, do you hear? Instantly!  <br>
(The cube appears and he vanishes. Back in the main area, Parsons wakes up.) <br>
PARSONS: Doctor, look out! Doctor. Where am I?
CLARE: It's all right. It's all right, Chris. It's over. Everything's going to be all right. <br>
PARSONS: Clare? <br>
DOCTOR: How are the others? <br>
ROMANA: They're all in shock, but there's no serious damage. <br>
(The Doctor kicks a defunct sphere.) <br>
ROMANA: I hate to think what would have happened to them if that tug-of-war had carried on much longer. <br>
DOCTOR: They wouldn't have been the only ones in trouble. This is a fearful mess. <br>
ROMANA: Can you unscramble them all? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Yes. It'll take a few hours, but they'll all get their own minds back. <br>
ROMANA: What'll you do with them then? <br>
DOCTOR: Take them back to dear old Shada. <br>
ROMANA: Put them back in a forgotten prison? <br>
DOCTOR: Let the Time Lords sort it out. I'm not going to play judge and jury. It was only forgotten about because the Professor 
made us forget. He didn't want his escape to be discovered. That must be why he stole the book when he left Gallifrey. <br>
ROMANA: Do you suppose he's still alive? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we'll find out. <br>
(He puts two halves of a sphere together and tosses it over his shoulder.)
<p>
<b>[Brig]</b>
<p>
(The cube deposits Skagra into the room on the spacecraft where he had
previously imprisoned the Doctor, Parsons and K9. He looks rather small here.) <br>
SKAGRA: Ship! Let me out of here. I am your Lord Skagra. Let me out! <br>
SHIP: I'm afraid I can no longer accept your orders. You are an enemy of my lord the Doctor. <br>
SKAGRA: I am your lord! I built you! Release me, I command you. And launch instantly! <br>
SHIP: Do you know the Doctor well? He is a wonderful man. He has done the most extraordinary things to my circuitry. <br>
SKAGRA: Release me! <br>
SHIP: Truly wonderful. If you like, I will tell you all about him. <br>
(Skagra sinks to his knees in despair.) <br>
SKAGRA: Let me out! Let me out! 
<p>
<b>[St Cedd's College]</b>
<p>(Wilkin and a police constable walk slowly though
the college.) <br>
CONSTABLE: Stolen a room? <br>
WILKIN: That is the only way I can describe it. <br>
CONSTABLE: Well, you see, sir, in my experience people don't usually
steal rooms very much. They may steal from rooms, but steal the rooms
themselves? Very rarely. In fact I think, er, never is probably the
word I'm looking for here, sir. I mean, where's the advantage in it?
Not much of a black market in rooms, is there? Wouldn't get much for
it. <br>
(They go through to the next courtyard.) <br>
WILKIN: I know it's very difficult to understand. It's also very easy
to be sarcastic. <br>
CONSTABLE: Sarcastic, sir? I don't know the word. Now why don't you run
over the salient points again? <br>
WILKIN: Oh. Well, I got to the door of the room and I opened it, and
beyond it there was nothing. <br>
CONSTABLE: Nothing at all, sir? <br>
WILKIN: Absolutely nothing at all. Well, nothing except for this sort
of blue haze. <br>
CONSTABLE: Ah, well, the blue haze, you see, sir, may be the vital clue
we're searching for. <br>
WILKIN: And I was not drinking. 
<p>
<b>[Outside Chronotis' rooms]</b>
<p>
CONSTABLE: So this is the famous door, is it sir? <br>
WILKIN: Yes. <br>
CONSTABLE: Behind which you saw your er, blue haze? <br>
WILKIN: Yes. <br>
(The Constable knocks on the door.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Come in! <br>
(The constable opens the door to reveal a coat on a peg beyond, and the
rest of the rooms.) <br>
CONSTABLE: Well, whoever took it, sir, seems to have brought it
back, don't they.
<p> 
<b>[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]</b> 
<p>(Chronotis is serving tea to the Doctor, Romana,
Clare and Parsons as Wilkin and the Constable enter. The Doctor is
reading out loud from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens.
Chapter 71, if you're interested. Or is he?) <br>
DOCTOR: Her little homely dress, her favourite, cried the old man,
pressing it to his breast and patting it with his shrivelled hand.
She'll miss it when she wakes. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Hello? Can I help you? <br>
CONSTABLE: Routine inquiry, sir. Report that this room has been stolen. <br>
DOCTOR: Huh! <br>
CHRONOTIS: Stolen? I don't think so, officer. (to Parsons) Ah, here you
are. Cup of tea and some aspirin. <br>
PARSONS: Thank you, Professor. <br>
CONSTABLE: Aspirin, sir? <br>
PARSONS: Yes, headache. <br>
CONSTABLE: Bad night last night, sir? <br>
PARSONS: Yes, you could say that. <br>
CONSTABLE: A lot of celebrating going on in college, was there, sir, last night? <br>
WILKIN: Nothing out of the ordinary. <br>
CONSTABLE: Be normal high jinks that would be then, sir, would it? Students roaming the streets stealing policeman's helmets,
bollards, and <br>
(The constable spots a blue police telephone box parked in the corner.) <br>
CONSTABLE: Might I ask where you got that, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's mine. <br>
CONSTABLE: Oh, really, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, really. Come on, Romana. Bye, Wilkin, Bristol, Keightley. Goodbye, Professor, we'll keep your secret. <br>
ROMANA: Bye everybody. <br>
(The Doctor and Romana enter the Tardis with the book.) <br>
ALL: Bye! <br>
CONSTABLE: Secret, sir? And what secret would that be? <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
CHRONOTIS: Cup of tea? <br>
CONSTABLE: Where did that police box go? <br>
CHRONOTIS: What police box that would be, officer? <br>
CONSTABLE: Right. Right. Coats on, everyone. You're all taking a little walk with me down to the Bridewell.
<p>
<b>[Tardis]</b>
<p>
(New live action scene. The Doctor is working under one side of the console, and K9 on the other. Romana is supposed to be in an 
inner room or corridor, because Lalla won't work directly with Tom.) <br>
ROMANA [OC]: Where was Skagra from, anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: K9's metabolic analysis says he was from the planet Dronid. Remember your Time Lord history? <br>
(Whatever K9 was doing makes the console go bang!) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! There was a schism in the College of the Cardinals. The rival President set up shop of Dronid. 
They forced him to come back by totally ignoring him. 
(Laughs then stands, but we only see his hands on the console.)<br>
ROMANA [OC]: It seems hard to believe the Professor was the great Salyavin. He's such a nice old man. 
I wonder if the stories of Salyavin were exaggerated? <br>
DOCTOR: (the elderly Tom Baker.) More than likely. The Time Lords over-react to everything. Look at the way they treat me. 
I expect at some time in the future, about two hundred years time, someone will meet me and say, is that really the Doctor? 
He seemed such a nice old man. <br>
(Laughs directly to camera.)
