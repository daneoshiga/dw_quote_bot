home, with staircase and front door. All the decorations are up and
that very rare meteorological event for London - snow in December -
can be seen through
the windows. A crash and a sudden heavy fall of snow past the bedroom
window wakes Clara.) <br>
SANTA [OC]: Argh! (Bells jingle) Moron! Numbskull! Elf! <br>
IAN [OC]: That's racist! <br>
SANTA [OC]: Of course it's not racist, you <i>are</i> an elf. <br>
(Clara gets out of bed, puts on a dressing gown and opens the door onto
the flat roof between three sides of the roof, and which has a skylight
in the middle. She has the only entrance to it from her attic bedroom.
There are wrapped presents and small orange fruit scattered all around.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SANTA: Chimneys? <br>
IAN: I'm sorry! <br>
SANTA: I'm just checking that you can see these massive chimneys. <br>
IAN: I, er, they, they're hard to miss. <br>
SANTA: Well, as you've clearly demonstrated, Ian. <br>
WOLF: Donner! Donner and Blitzen. Come on down. Down here, boys. <br>
(There are three members of species Rangifer tarandus flying around,
bells jingling on their harness, and one has a glowing red nose. This is, of course, impossible.) <br>
WOLF: Good boys, good boys. Good boy. Rudolph? <br>
SANTA: Just, just clear all the tangerines up. Pick 'em up. All of
them, Ian. <br>
IAN: You know no one really likes the tangerines, don't you? <br>
(We now see that this is Dan Starkey out from under the Strax makeup.) <br>
SANTA: How dare you! That's my signature gift. That and the walnut. <br>
WOLF: Down here, boys, come on. Come. Rudolph? <br>
(Wolf the elf kindly has his name embroidered on the back of his
jacket. Ian looks up from gathering tangerines.) <br>
IAN: Er, sir? We've been seen. <br>
SANTA: Hello. <br>
CLARA: Hello. <br>
WOLF: Hello, ha ha! <br>
IAN: Hello, human. <br>
WOLF: You can't call her human. <br>
IAN: It's not racist. They don't mind. <br>
SANTA: Hush up, both of you. Oh, sorry about this, girl. We are just
three passing, perfectly ordinary roof people, doing some emergency
roof things. Carry on. Merry Christmas. If, if it is Christmas, I mean.
Heh, heh. I don't much care for things like that, myself. Pfft. I mean,
Christmas. (laughs)
<br>
CLARA: Are you Santa Claus? <br>
SANTA: Me? No. Oh, no. It's ridiculous. Heh, heh. No, no, no. <br>
(But then Clara sees the reindeer fly past behind him.) <br>
WOLF: Rudolph! Rudolph!
Down here now! <br>
SANTA: All right, fine, yes. Yes, it's me. Ha! Guilty. How did you
recognise me? <br>
WOLF: You know how you grew that beard as a bit of a disguise? People
have picked up on it. <br>
CLARA: Okay. No. Hang on. Stop. Shut up. What? Seriously, you, you're
Father Christmas. You're real. <br>
SANTA: Of course I'm real. <br>
WOLF: How could he not be real? <br>
SANTA: Huh? How do you think those presents got under the tree every
year? By magic? <br>
CLARA: Well, I thought it was my mum and <br>
IAN + WOLF: Mum and Dad? <br>
SANTA: Ho, ho! <br>
IAN: Well, of course it was.
<br>
WOLF: I mean, it makes perfect sense. <br>
IAN: Yeah, your mum and dad, one day a year, for no particular reason,
just out of the blue, suddenly decide to give you a great, big pile of
presents. <br>
(So no one&nbsp;there knows about the tradition of gift giving on Dec
25th, and that Santa Claus is really Sinterklass which is Dutch for
Saint Nicholas who had a reputation for secret gift giving, and whose day
is 7th Dec. Tut. What is modern education coming to?)<br>
WOLF: No, no, no. Because they love you so much. It's a lovely story,
dear. <br>
IAN: Yeah, but it's time to start living in the real world, yeah? <br>
(Santa has got his notebook out.) <br>
SANTA: Okay. Right. Clara Oswald. Mostly favours travel books, science
kits, strict ban on hair products. Marginal for the naughty list, '93.
Tut, tut, tut. Believer until the age of nine. Why did you stop? <br>
CLARA: Because you're a fairy tale. I grew out of fairy tales. <br>
SANTA: (sighs) Did you, Clara? Did you really? <br>
(The Tardis materialises next to Clara's roof door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Clara, I want you to step inside the Tardis. I don't want you
to talk, I want you to do as I ask. Please. <br>
IAN: That was good, with the box. <br>
WOLF: Hmph. Not often we get upstaged on a rooftop. Hmm. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm really here. I'm back. Now get inside the Tardis. <br>
(Clara obeys silently and shuts the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: I know what this is. I know what's happening, and I know what's
at stake. <br>
SANTA: I don't think you do, Doctor. But I promise, before this
Christmas Day is done, you will be glad of my help. <br>
DOCTOR: Happy Easter. <br>
(He goes into the Tardis.) <br>
WOLF: Ooh, brutal! <br>
IAN: Cool exit line, though. <br>
SANTA: Be sure to save some room for a tangerine, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Nobody likes the tangerines.

yeah? <br>
(The Doctor starts setting coordinates.)
<br>
CLARA: Doctor? Talk to me. I never thought I was going to see you
again. What is going on out there? What's happening? <br>
(The time rotor starts spinning overhead.) <br>
CLARA: Oh, that noise. Never knew how much I loved it. <br>
DOCTOR: There's something you have to ask yourself, and it's important.
Your life may depend on it. Everybody's life. Do you really believe in
Santa Claus? <br>
CLARA: Do you know what? Yeah. Right now, here, I think I do.

SHONA: Look. Just don't ask, yeah? And don't look. Don't make me think
about them. <br>

Doctor scans them with his screwdriver as they get out of bed.) <br>
DOCTOR: Deaf. Blind. How can they see us? How do they even know that
we're here? <br>
SHONA: They can only see you, yeah, if you see them. So just, so just
don't look, don't even think about them. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, telepathic. They can home in on their own image in someone
else's brain. Third-party perception. Mind piracy. We're being hacked. <br>
CLARA: What does that even mean? <br>
(The Sleepers are all standing.) <br>
DOCTOR: The visual input from your optic nerve is being streamed to
their brains. Stop broadcasting. Close your eyes. <br>
(Clara obeys. The images of the alien heads stretch and morph.) <br>
CLARA: They're still coming, aren't they? <br>
DOCTOR: It's because you're still thinking about them. So long as you
retain them as an active memory, they can still home in. Think about
something else. <br>

SHONA: (sings) So here it is, Merry Christmas <br>
CLARA: Why is she singing? <br>

CLARA: I can't help it! <br>
DOCTOR: Danny Pink! What is Danny Pink up to right now? He's probably
flirting with your neighbour or texting women of low moral character. <br>
(After seeing Danny in her mind, Clara opens her eyes and slaps the
Doctor's face, hard. The Sleepers,
who are now very close to them, close their maws.) <br>

very big guns.) <br>

the ceiling.) <br>
ALBERT: Here they come! <br>

DOCTOR: No! <br>

explosion which destroys the exterior door. A tangerine rolls in from the snow, followed by a troop of
varicoloured slinkies and toy robots. Rudolph rears up, with Santa on
his back, viewed through the hole where the exterior door used to be.
Santa dismounts.) <br>
SANTA: Whoa, whoa! Ah! Good boy. <br>
(He walks into the infirmary, followed by Ian with a balloon toy, and
Wolf with an air gun.) <br>
SANTA: Well, now. What seems to be the problem? This is the North Pole.
We don't want any trouble here. <br>
(Rudolph bellows.) <br>
SANTA: Hey, Rudolph. <br>
(Santa uses his car key fob to 'lock' Rudolph. Beep!) <br>
SANTA: Easy, son. Oi! Sleepy heads! It's Christmas Eve, early to bed. <br>
(Santa claps his hands and the Sleepers return to their beds.) <br>
ASHLEY: Who the hell are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, take a guess. Go on, push the boat out. Tooth Fairy, maybe?
Easter Bunny? <br>
IAN: Shut your mouth, wise guy, or you get yours. <br>
WOLF: It's a balloon animal. <br>
IAN: That's a toy gun. <br>
WOLF: Yeah, well, at least it's unsuitable for children under four.
Parts small enough to swallow, so watch out. <br>

SHONA: Now, this is ridiculous. Am I, am I dreaming? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, very good. <br>
ASHLEY: I need to know exactly who you are, and what's happening here. <br>
(Santa gently points her gun away from his midriff.) <br>
SANTA: Hello, Ashley. Lead scientist on a polar expedition. Oh, that
microscope really paid off, didn't it? Now, your mum and dad
wanted me to get you a toy one, but sometimes, I take a chance. <br>
ASHLEY: Who are you? Why are you dressed like that? <br>
SANTA: Why do you think? <br>
SHONA: Come on, this is mental. This is totally not happening. <br>
SANTA: I got three words, Shona. Don't make me use 'em. <br>

SANTA: My. Little. Pony. <br>
SHONA: Shut up, you. <br>
SANTA: Yeah? I've got lots more, babe. <br>
SHONA: I will mark you, Santa. <br>

CLARA: Okay, Doctor, are you going to explain? What is going on? <br>
SANTA: It's an invasion, Miss Oswald. <br>
CLARA: An invasion of, of what, elves? <br>
WOLF: Whoa! <i>That</i> is racist. <br>
IAN: Elfist! <br>
WOLF: Yeah. Which is a bit hypocritical, from someone of your height. <br>
(Wolf is ever so slightly taller than Clara. Santa fetches a large
transparent specimen container 16367//KB from his saddlebags.) <br>
SANTA: Huh? You seen them before, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I've heard of them. <br>
SANTA: The Kantrofarri. <br>
DOCTOR: Colloquially known as the Dream Crabs. <br>
SANTA: Yeah. Depending on how many of those are already on Earth, the
human race may well have seen its last day. So, are we going to stand
about arguing about whether I'm real or not, or are we going to get
busy saving Christmas? <br>
IAN: Oh, ho, ho! Santa goes badass! <br>
WOLF: He's giving me the feels. <br>

you dissolve. Merciful, I suppose. <br>

SANTA: Why me? It's the North Pole, it's Christmas Day. You're dying.
Who you gonna call? Just one last time, huh? One last Christmas, as if
your lives depended on it. Please! Ho, ho, ho. Believe in Santa. <br>
(They all shrug and form a circle.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not very good with this holdy-hand thing. <br>
CLARA: Tough. <br>
DOCTOR: I <i>will</i> hold Clara's hand, but that's it. <br>
CLARA: Shona, take his hand. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, I'm fine, I'm fine. This is very Christmassy, isn't it? <br>
ASHLEY: Okay, so what do we <br>
(Santa, Ian and Wolf have vanished.) <br>
BELLOWS: Where did he go? <br>
DOCTOR: We're waking up. That part of the dream is over. We're on our
own now. <br>
ALBERT: Well, then. What do we do? <br>
DOCTOR: That pain in your head. Make it worse. Head towards it. <br>
ASHLEY: So when we wake up, what do we expect? <br>
DOCTOR: Only a few moments will have passed at the most. The attack is
still in progress. <br>
SHONA: I'm scared. <br>
DOCTOR: Congratulations. That means you're not an idiot. <br>
CLARA: It's not like the last time. <br>
DOCTOR: Last time wasn't real. <br>
ASHLEY: Good luck. Stay calm. And God bless us, every one. <br>

DOCTOR: Only if they're stupid. There are polar bears on this ice cap.
Am I supposed to do something about that, too? <br>
CLARA: We know Dream Crabs are still on Earth. <br>

you, gobby one. <br>
(He throws a manual to Shona.) <br>
SHONA: I have a name, actually. <br>
DOCTOR: Doesn't matter. I don't need it. When we first met you in the
infirmary, what were you doing? <br>
SHONA: Mmm. It's a long story. <br>
DOCTOR: Uptight boss one. (another manual) What is the primary mission of this polar
base? <br>
ASHLEY: It's a long story. <br>
DOCTOR: Sexy one. What brings you to the North Pole at your age? <br>
BELLOWS: It's a long (pause) story. <br>
CLARA: Okay, why are they all giving the same answer, because that is a
tiny bit freaky. <br>
DOCTOR: If you think that's freaky, try this. We were in the Tardis. Why
did <i>we</i> come here? <br>
CLARA: It's a long story. <br>
(The penny drops.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor?
<br>
DOCTOR: Dreams. They're funny. Ha, ha, ha. They're disjointed. They're,
they're silly. They're full of gaps. But you don't notice, because the
dream protects itself. Stops you asking the right questions. For
example, why do you have four manuals, one each, when you have a crew
of eight? Or did you forget about your friends in the infirmary here? <br>
ALBERT: But we woke up. <br>
DOCTOR: Dreams within dreams, I warned you. <br>
BELLOWS: This isn't a dream. I know it isn't. <br>

for one single moment of our lives. Clara? Page number. Make it a good

ASHLEY: Admit what? <br>
DOCTOR: That the pain is still there. <br>
SHONA: Actually, I think it's getting worse. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, there is an alien organism in your brain, eating it. Of
course it's getting worse. <br>
CLARA: Doctor? What are they doing?
<br>(On the monitor, the Sleepers are sitting up on their beds.) <br>
DOCTOR: Factually, getting up. Significantly, sensing the endgame. <br>
CLARA: How? <br>
ASHLEY: I don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, look at them. Go on. Look at them. Look at them properly.
Look who they are. They're you. The Sleepers are you. <br>
(Close up of a name badge - Prof Rona Bellows.) <br>
SHONA: How can they be us? <br>
(Shona McCullough) <br>
DOCTOR: Because we're dreaming, all of us. This base isn't real. None
of us are actually standing in the room. I'm probably asleep in my
Tardis. Clara, you must be in bed. God knows where the rest of you are,
probably scattered all over the world. But wherever you are, the Dream
Crabs have got us, and we're all being networked into the same
nightmare. <br>
BELLOWS: What are they doing? <br>(The Sleepers are walking towards the cameras.)<br>
DOCTOR: It's your subconscious again. The Sleepers represent the part
of your mind that's already surrendered to the attack. These are dream
images of what's coming to kill you. <br>
ALBERT: That's me? That's actually me? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's a metaphorical construct representing a psychic attack
within a shared dreamscape. Do please keep up. <br>
ALBERT: But it's me. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't get too close. <br>
(Sleeper Albert puts its hand up to the camera, and Albert leans into
the monitor.) <br>
ALBERT: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because this is a nightmare. <br>
(Albert gets grabbed by the Sleeper's hand and pulled through the
monitor with a scream. The Doctor and Clara try to grab him.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! Clara! <br>
(Ashley and Bellows reach out to their Sleeper images on the screens.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look out, they're coming through. Out! Outside, now! Run, run,
run, run! Run! Clara, run. Run, all of you, run. Run! <br>

extinguisher on them but it doesn't slow them down.)

DOCTOR: This dream just killed your friend. Start taking it seriously. <br>
SHONA: Where's Albert? Where's the professor? <br>
DOCTOR: He probably just woke up somewhere in the real world, dead. If
we don't wake up now, we'll do the same. <br>
CLARA: But how? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
(The Sleepers thump the door, making fist marks in the thick metal.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis! Come on! Come on! <br>
CLARA: Doctor, it's not the real Tardis. <br>

SHONA: So tell us how to wake up. Because you're always talking like
you're so clever, going on and on. So tell us what to do! <br>
DOCTOR: We have to leave this place. <br>
SHONA: Leave it? <br>

up? <br>
