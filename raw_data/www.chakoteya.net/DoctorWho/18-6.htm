ADRIC: So this in N-space. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the old home universe. It's many times larger than
anything you're used to. <br>
ADRIC: All those stars. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ADRIC: Do you know them all? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, just the interesting ones. <br>
ADRIC: How can you tell which is which? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, law of probability, that sort of thing, you know. Anyway,
we're supposed to be on our way back to Gallifrey. <br>
ADRIC: I don't see what the law of probability's got to do with it. <br>
DOCTOR: No. What? Adric, I give you a privileged insight into the
mystery of time, yes? <br>
ADRIC: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Open your mind to adventures beyond imagining, yes? <br>
ADRIC: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And you criticise my logic. <br>
ADRIC: No. No, I'm just saying that a lot of the time you don't really
make sense. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Ah. Oh, you've noticed that, have you? Well, I mean, anyone
can talk sense. As long as that's understood, you and I are going to
get on splendidly. <br>
ADRIC: Then where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Metulla Orionsis, I'd say. Does that make sense? <br>
(Adric checks a read-out on the console.) <br>
ADRIC: That's what it says here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's an interesting planetary system. <br>
ADRIC: Traken, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? You're beginning to get the hang of this console. Yes,
Traken. (reads) Traken Union, famous for its universal harmony. A whole
empire held together by <br>
ADRIC: By? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, by people just being terribly nice to each other. <br>
ADRIC: Well, that makes a change. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I don't think I've actually been there. Just know it by
repute, so I'll tell you all about it sometime. <br>
(The Doctor goes through the inner door.) <br>
ADRIC: Well, you won't have to. We're going there anyway. <br>
(The Doctor re-enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Going to Traken? Who said so? <br>
ADRIC: You set the controls for it. <br>
DOCTOR: You set them. <br>
ADRIC: No! No, you must have. <br>
DOCTOR: But I didn't. Did I? I wonder what the law of probability would
say about that? <br>
(The Tardis twirls lightly through the satellites of Traken.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, what seems to be the problem? <br>
ADRIC: We've gone into orbit round one of the planets. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought so. <br>
ADRIC: Thought what? <br>
DOCTOR: I thought you might appreciate it if I gave you the impression
I knew what was happening. We could panic, of course, but where would
that get us? <br>
ADRIC: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
ADRIC: Well, you should know. <br>
DOCTOR: Adric. <br>
ADRIC: Well, you are a Time Lord, aren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Adric. If I knew everything that was going to happen, where
would the fun be? <br>
(The Doctor looks up and across the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
(A very old man with a highly domed head and long finger nails is
sitting in a plush scrollwork chair.) <br>
KEEPER: How do you do. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, Adric. The Keeper of Traken. <br>
KEEPER: Well guessed, Doctor. The reports I hear of your intelligence
are true, I see. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well, it wasn't difficult to guess who'd taken possession
of the Tardis. I mean, there can't be many people in the universe with
the capacity of just dropping in like this. <br>
ADRIC: Well, you could have told me. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Time reveals everything, Adric. What can we do for you,
Keeper? <br>
KEEPER: Listen closely, Doctor. As you see, the passing ages have taken
toll of me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know that feeling. <br>
KEEPER: But unlike you, my time of Dissolution is near and the power
entrusted to me is ebbing away. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. It's still fairly impressive. I mean, I couldn't
flit around the universe in an old chair like this. <br>
KEEPER: I have all the minds of the Union to draw on. I am only the
organising principle. It is on that count I ask you to come to Traken. <br>
DOCTOR: Right! <br>
KEEPER: Think carefully before you agree. There is great danger in this
for you and your young friend. <br>
DOCTOR: How so, Keeper? <br>
KEEPER: I fear that our beloved world of Traken faces disaster. <br>
ADRIC: Universal harmony, you said. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
KEEPER: The Doctor does not exaggerate. Since the time of the Keepers,
our Union has been the most harmonious the universe has ever seen. Does
the boy not know of this? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, he's not local. <br>
(The Keeper vanishes.) <br>
DOCTOR: E-space, wasn't it? Where's he gone? <br>
(The Keeper reappears on the other side of the console, by the
scanner.) <br>
KEEPER: How vain one can still be. I thought the whole universe knew the
history of our little empire. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. They say the atmosphere there was so full of goodness that
evil just shrivelled up and died. Maybe that's why I never went there. <br>
KEEPER: Rumour does not exaggerate, Doctor. <br>
ADRIC: The screen. <br>
KEEPER: Oh, forgive me. May I borrow it for a moment? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh please, Keeper, please. <br>
KEEPER: Yes, we have indeed been visited by evil many times. Our
compassion for these poor distorted creatures seems to attract them
like moths to a flame. Sometimes they are redeemed. <br>
(The screen shows a group of men tending a park.) <br>
KEEPER: The Fosters are the guardians of the spiritual welfare of our
capital. <br>
(A glowing red statue lands on a low plinth near the men.) <br>
KEEPER: They name such creatures Melkur. <br>
DOCTOR: Melkur? <br>
KEEPER: Melkur. Literally a fly caught by honey. The Fosters know
there's nothing to fear from these visitations. <br>
DOCTOR: So what becomes of this Melkur? <br>
KEEPER: It's baleful influence will not extend beyond the grove, and
even here it will only produce a few weeds. Like others before it, the
creature will calcify and pass harmlessly into the soil. But the demise
of any living thing is painful to us. <br>
(A woman in blue carries orange flowers up to the dull statue with bits
of moss growing on it.) <br>
KASSIA [on screen]: And how are you today, you poor Melkur? The Fosters
have appointed me to look after you. There isn't much I can do. It must
be awful being rooted to the spot like a tree. If you weren't quite so
evil, you might be able to move a bit, just around the grove. Being so
evil, you can't even speak. Never mind. I'll come and visit you again
soon. Oh. By the way, my name's Kassia. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that particular evil seems to be well under control. <br>
KEEPER: Seemed, Doctor. That was many years ago. Young Kassia is now
grown up. Such was her purity of spirit that she became a consul, and
the day of her marriage to Tremas has become, somehow, the turning
point for Traken. <br>
(The scanner shows the happy couple drinking goblets with linked arms
before kissing in front of a delighted crowd.) </font></p>

Ainley</a>.) <br>
TREMAS: Enough, Trakens. Enough! Applause is heady, and I've already
drunk more wine than a man of my responsibilities should. To be a
consul and a father I thought were duties enough, but now once again to
be a husband, and to Kassia. <br>
KASSIA: My husband is right. The wine has flowed freely tonight.
Perhaps I should take him home. <br>
SERON: Already you've begun to pamper him, Kassia, like that Melkur of
yours in the grove. <br>
KATURA: People have begun to think she was married to the statue, all
these years she's been tending him.<br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0886203/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Margo

LUVIC: I hope she looks after Tremas better than she looks after the
Melkur. He's covered in moss. <br>
KASSIA: I'm sure it does not become us to mock Melkur. <br>
KEEPER: I rather think it is you they are mocking, Kassia. <br>
(The Keeper and his chair appear behind moving etched glass screens at
the top of the steps.) <br>
TREMAS: Keeper, you were able to join us. <br>
KEEPER: No affairs of state could keep me from such an occasion as
this. Come, the pair of you. Receive my blessing. <br>
KASSIA: We are honoured, Keeper. <br>
(Tremas and Kassia link hands and kneel.) <br>
KEEPER: Kassia was right, Tremas. She promised to tend the Melkur while
its power still lived. Who would have thought its demise could be so
protracted. She has been loyal, and we now release her. <br>
TREMAS: Come, Kassia. Thank the Keeper. <br>
KASSIA: But who will tend him? <br>
KEEPER: The Fosters, perhaps. Since you drove them from the grove, it
has become neglected. Fruit trees need some little tending too, you
know. No, Nyssa shall watch over your Melkur. And she must share in the
blessing, too. <br>
(Tremas' daughter, in her mauve gown, steps forward between Tremas and
Kassia, and kneels.) <br>
KEEPER: I, nearing the time of my passing, bless the marriage of these
two, Tremas and Kassia, truest of my five true consuls, together with
Nyssa, now daughter to you both. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KEEPER: Now it begins. My certain knowledge of the
coming Dissolution. No Keeper lasts forever, and the period of
transition is always difficult. But I sensed more than that, even as I
came to name Tremas as my successor. <br>
DOCTOR: Sense what, Keeper? <br>
KEEPER: All-pervading evil, and somehow nurtured in those three good
people standing before me to receive the blessing of the Keeper.
Doctor, my time is close. I need your help. <br>
DOCTOR: Anything I can do, Keeper. <br>
ADRIC: That goes for me, too. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Well, we'll see. We'll see. <br>
KEEPER: I am fearful even to involve the Doctor. He will face
unimaginable hazard, confront power that would obliterate even a Time
Lord. Even you, Doctor. Goodbye, my friend. Farewell. <br>
(The Keeper and his chair vanish.) <br>
ADRIC: Well, that's a funny way of going about things. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, isn't it. What do you make of it? <br>
ADRIC: I don't know. But I do hope we know what we're doing. <br>
DOCTOR: So do I. We? <br>
ADRIC: You. </font></p>

TREMAS: If all the stars were silver, and the sky a giant purse in my
fist, I couldn't be happier than I am tonight. <br>
NEMAN: Poetry apart, Consul Tremas, I'd rather be rich than Keeper
Nominate any night of the year. <br>
TREMAS: I wasn't thinking of state duties, Proctor. <br>
NEMAN: Ha, Kassia, of course. But she should be with you, surely? <br>
TREMAS: She's gone to the grove to take leave of her precious Melkur. <br>

could I speak to of my unhappiness? To be Keeper Nominate, they regard
it as a great honour, but when the Keeper's Dissolution comes it will
take Tremas from me forever. And I know his time will be soon. I know
it will be soon. <br>
MELKUR: Soon. <br>

arm.) <br>
ADRIC: Whatever's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Knowledge. Accumulated wisdom of centuries. <br>
ADRIC: A gazetteer? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they're just a couple of my old time logs. You know, I
really may have been to Traken. It's so difficult to keep track of. <br>
ADRIC: I suppose it helps keeping a time log. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Mind you, I don't bother now. Much too busy. Actually,
this might not be the right volume. Here, take that and make yourself
useful. <br>
ADRIC: What am I looking for? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you know, Traken, Keepers, all-pervading evil. <br>

SERON: Kassia has called a meeting? <br>
LUVIC: Another of her strange ideas, perhaps? <br>
SERON: Kassia is a gifted sensitive. Her spiritual qualities are beyond
question. But Tremas has yet to persuade her that we live in the real
world, not some chaos of superstition. <br>
LUVIC: So this man's death was natural, you think? <br>
SERON: He was full of years. Old men die. <br>
NEMAN: I've never seen one die like that. Pain on his face, and fear
perhaps? Is that natural? <br>
SERON: Unexpected, certainly, but I am never one to jump to
conclusions, particularly in the presence of others. There is rumour
enough abroad. <br>
NEMAN: With all this restlessness within the Union, Consuls, I don't
know if perhaps the Fosters should be armed. <br>
LUVIC: Armed? That's an unusual suggestion. <br>
NEMAN: These are unusual times, Consul. <br>
SERON: Well, Tremas? Has science brought us any nearer discovering how
the Foster died? <br>
TREMAS: It's so fantastic I hardly know whether to believe it myself. <br>
SERON: Fantastic? <br>
(Tremas holds up his tricorder.) <br>
TREMAS: I've scanned the courtyard several times. Something quite
strange has registered. See for yourself. <br>
SERON: It seems our worst fears are confirmed. <br>
LUVIC: They are? <br>
SERON: Tremas has clearly fallen under Kassia's spell in more ways than
one. Tell the meeting I shall be delayed a moment. Tremas clearly needs
humouring. <br>
(Luvic enters the Court building.) <br>
SERON: What do these readings mean? <br>
TREMAS: It's impossible to say. It's beyond the scope of the instrument
to analyse or measure. <br>
SERON: You're sure it's not an error? <br>
TREMAS: An error. Yes, it must be. <br>
SERON: But if the readings are true? <br>
TREMAS: If these readings are true, then obviously some, some force is
taking possession of Traken. </font></p>

ADRIC: If I could understand it. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ADRIC: Well, look. I read about something that's just happened. <br>
DOCTOR: And? <br>
ADRIC: The next page says it didn't happen at all. <br>
DOCTOR: So? <br>
ADRIC: Over the page says it did happen, but many years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Well, I suppose it is a bit above your head. Mind you,
they did say I had a very sophisticated prose style. <br>
ADRIC: As for your handwriting. <br>
DOCTOR: Handwriting? What about my handwriting? <br>
ADRIC: It's marvellous. <br>
DOCTOR: We've arrived. Right, now let's see what this place really
looks like. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KATURA: Murder? Here, in the precincts of the
court? <br>
TREMAS: We don't know that it was murder, Consul Katura. <br>
KATURA: You have determined the cause of death? <br>
LUVIC: I thought it was natural. <br>
SERON: There's no need to be alarmist, Tremas. <br>
TREMAS: He died through contact with some high energy source. How and
why it happened, I cannot say. <br>
KASSIA: (sotto) A sign. Power of Melkur. (aloud) Consuls, I sense some
great danger coming to us all. The Fosters must be armed. <br>
SERON: With respect, Kassia, we cannot allow superstition to stampede
reason. <br>
KASSIA: I have reason. <br>
KATURA: Then you have only to let the Consuls know what it is. <br>
TREMAS: Well, Kassia? <br>
(Kassia sits down and stays quiet.) <br>
SERON: We are the Keeper's appointed consuls. Let his benevolent wisdom
be our guide, not irrational fears and intuitions. Are we agreed to
summon the Keeper? <br>
LUVIC: First we must decide about the Fosters. I feel that perhaps
Kassia's right on that point. They should be armed. <br>
(Katura and Tremas nod.) <br>
SERON: Send for Proctor Neman. <br>

comes out first and sees the statue staring straight at them.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KASSIA: I speak for the many peoples of the Traken
Union. They ask why crops fail, why droughts and floods disturb our
planets. And now, violent death in the very precinct of the court
itself. What do we tell them? <br>
SERON: Normal events, Consul, when the span of our Keeper nears its
end. <br>
KASSIA: Nothing is normal at such a time. This Keeper, whose protection
we have enjoyed for a thousand years, is dying. The power is growing
weaker day by day. <br>
TREMAS: Trakens have survived times like this in the past. We shall do
so now, through science and understanding. <br>
KASSIA: Brave words, husband, but no great comfort to a people being
stripped of their traditional protections. <br>
SERON: The Keeper knows our situation. He'll speak when the time is
right. </font></p>

gate of the grove, so Adric just pushes open the left one. They go
through to meet an unwelcoming committee of armed Fosters.) <br>

(The Doctor and Adric reach for the sky.) <br>

Consul Seron. I propose we put it to the vote. <br>
LUVIC: The sooner, the better. <br>
TREMAS: Very well, but you know the law. The vote must be unanimous.
Consuls, it is proposed that we summon the Keeper. Those in favour
raise your hands. <br>
(Seron does not raise his hand.) <br>
TREMAS: Consul Seron. <br>
SERON: If the majority are agreed, then I'll concur, of course. <br>

SERON: Open the door. <br>
(Neman enters with the Doctor and Adric, and armed Fosters.) <br>
NEMAN: Consuls, the cause of the evil. We have found them. <br>
(In the grove, the Melkur's eyes glow red.) <br>
TREMAS: So, who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I wondered when you were going to ask. You know, I hate to say
this sort of thing, but Traken hospitality isn't what it used to be. <br>
ADRIC: He's called the Doctor, and I'm Adric. <br>
DOCTOR: It's probably the usual misunderstanding. We keep running into
this sort of thing. Actually, we were invited here this time. <br>
ADRIC: This is true. <br>
TREMAS: Invited? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, to pitch in, help out, that sort of thing. <br>
TREMAS: Who asked you here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, excuse my name dropping, but the Keeper, actually. <br>
TREMAS: You've had contact with the Keeper? <br>
DOCTOR: In a manner of speaking, yes. <br>
LUVIC: I don't follow this at all. <br>
TREMAS: The Keeper said one would come amongst us to help Trakens.
Could you be this one, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, unless he's in the habit of soliciting help, yes. <br>
KASSIA: Sacred law decrees that the Keeper has contact only through his
consuls. <br>
SERON: You say, Doctor, that you arrived here in some kind of craft? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SERON: And landed in the grove? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. We thought we'd walk the rest of the way. You know, fresh
air, stretch the legs. <br>
SERON: Then your craft should still be there. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
TREMAS: Proctor Neman, send some of your brothers to confirm this. <br>
NEMAN: Certainly, Consul. <br>
(In the grove, Melkur fires energy bolts from its eyes at the Tardis,
which disappears.) <br>
TREMAS: But if they are indeed known to the Keeper, can we risk such a
grave injustice, Kassia? <br>
KATURA: They can't be known to the Keeper or we would have been
informed. <br>
LUVIC: I don't understand what's going on. <br>
NEMAN: Consul Tremas. <br>
FOSTER: There's nothing there. <br>
NEMAN: The Fosters have searched the grove for the stranger's craft. <br>
TREMAS: And you have found it. <br>
NEMAN: There is no craft. The grove is empty. <br>
KASSIA: Does anyone doubt now? <br>
(Night has fallen. Melkur turns its head to watch the patrolling
Fosters.) <br>
KATURA: It seems they have indeed been lying to us. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, why don't we summon up the Keeper or something? <br>
TREMAS: We are about to do so. <br>
KASSIA: Yes, we will summon the Keeper. <br>
(The consuls walk up to the glass screens and bow. Meanwhile, Melkur
walks out of the grove. The consuls put their large rings into keyholes
either side of the Keeper's screens.) <br>
TREMAS: Keeper of Traken, by unanimous consent, your consul summons
you. <br>
(The Keeper appears behind the screens.) <br>
TREMAS: Keeper, we have strangers among us who claim they are known to
you. <br>
KASSIA: And dare to say they were summoned here to Traken at your
request. <br>
(The screens slide open.) <br>
KEEPER: Bring the strangers forward. <br>
(Neman and the armed Fosters bring the Doctor and Adric forward. Melkur
appears at the partly open door.) <br>

here. <br>

KASSIA: Execute them. This evil must be stamped out. <br>

LUVIC: Against the Keeper? <br>

quarter. Tell me more about this Melkur. <br>
KATURA: Consuls, this Doctor is procrastinating. <br>
SERON: Perhaps, but I would like this clear. Are you asking us to
believe that some kind of psychic power has been used? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not at all. A high energy beam. And if I had the right

MELKUR: Consul Luvic, you may now summon Proctor Neman. <br>
DOCTOR: I should do it, Consul, if I were you. He'll make you. <br>
MELKUR: There is no compulsion. It is your Keeper who asks. Do it to
serve him. <br>
DOCTOR: Huh. No compulsion? You've changed your tune. <br>
MELKUR: Apparently you haven't, Doctor. Consuls, this man is known to
me, as is his ambition. <br>
DOCTOR: My only ambition is to stop you, Melkur. <br>
MELKUR: An unhappy man. The old Keeper rejected him and you Consuls
sentenced him to death. Is that not so? <br>
KATURA: He speaks the truth. Do as the Keeper says, Luvic. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) I want to get a closer look at that Melkur creature. I
have the oddest feeling we've met somewhere before. </font></p>

MELKUR: Known to him, Consul? It was he that arranged that I should
succeed. <br>
TREMAS: Impossible! No outsider can become Keeper. <br>
KATURA: That's true. Our choice was Consul Kassia. <br>
MELKUR: Yes, Consul. That is why it happened as you saw it happen. The
old Keeper foresaw this, and Kassia gave her life so that I should
serve you. <br>

ADRIC: I don't know, but the Fourier analysis we did says it is. <br>
NYSSA: But why is it so much bigger inside than it is outside? <br>
ADRIC: Oh, the Doctor told me that was because it was dimensionally
transcendental. <br>
NYSSA: What does that mean? <br>

DOCTOR: Talking of entropy, what happened last night in the sanctum,

TREMAS: It's normal, Doctor. The reaction when a new Keeper succeeds.
The effort weakens him. His power comes and goes at first. <br>
DOCTOR: A C-reaction. Melkur all sweetness and reason because he's
vulnerable. <br>
TREMAS: Yes, stalling opposition until his power's secure. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, perhaps we could apply the ultimate sanction. <br>
TREMAS: His power's increasing by the minute. The full reaction process

TREMAS: Er, ah! Gamma mode encryption. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Then there'll be a single large prime number at the root
of it and we don't have the integer key. What a pity you still haven't

take thousands of years. <br>

up his coat sleeve. There is a knock on the door.) <br>

MELKUR: Only a beginning, Doctor. Persuade your friend to cooperate. <br>

after all. You know why he wants it. He doesn't want you to show it to

moves in close.) <br>
