<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VALEYARD: Members of the court, we have just
witnessed a typical glorious escapade of the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Madam! I ask that the court protect me from the abuse of the
Brickyard here. <br>
VALEYARD: How pathetic and juvenile are your attempts at humour. <br>
INQUISITOR: Gentlemen, may I remind you this is a court of law, not a
debating society for maladjusted, psychotic sociopaths. You will both
conduct yourselves in an orderly manner and show proper respect for the
judicial procedure. I hope I make myself very clear. <br>
(The Doctor and the Valeyard bow.) <br>
INQUISITOR: And Doctor, the prosecuting counsel's title is the
Valeyard. Not the brickyard, backyard, knacker's yard or any other kind
of yard. Again, do I make myself clear? <br>
DOCTOR: Piercingly and irrefutably so, madam. <br>
INQUISITOR: Proceed. <br>
VALEYARD: As I was saying, we have just witnessed a sequence in the
Doctor's history which illustrated perfectly his almost gleeful
pleasure in interfering in the development of alien life forms. <br>
DOCTOR: I object! <br>
INQUISITOR: Sit down and shut up! <br>
VALEYARD: Thank you, Sagacity. <br>
DOCTOR: Sagacity? You sycophant. Since when has that been a form of
address used in a Gallifreyan court of law? <br>
VALEYARD: I am simply showing respect to our learned Inquisitor. <br>
INQUISITOR: An attitude I much approve. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you would, wouldn't you? Sagacity, indeed. <br>
INQUISITOR: Doctor! Continue. <br>
VALEYARD: I should now like to present the Doctor's next frightening
adventure. In fact, the one in which he was engaged when removed from
time and brought to this court. <br>
(The Doctor raises his arm.) <br>
INQUISITOR: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What about the box? <br>
INQUISITOR: The box? <br>
DOCTOR: And the fact that Earth was two light years away from its
original position? <br>
VALEYARD: That is not relevant to this segment of evidence. <br>
DOCTOR: It was relevant enough to be bleeped from the Matrix record. <br>
INQUISITOR: The Valeyard is quite right. That is a matter for the High
Council to adjudicate upon. It is not the business of this trial. <br>
VALEYARD: If we may see from the Doctor's arrival on the planet Thoros
Beta. Twenty fourth century, last quarter, fourth year, seventh month,
third day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mostly pink seas with blue land. A ringed planet
hangs large in the sky. The Tardis materialises just in the water by a
cliff. The Doctor and Peri stand on the threshold.) <br>
PERI: Whoa, far out. Are you quite sure this is the planet you aimed
for? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm. Fancy a swim? <br>
PERI: In that goo? No thanks. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a pretty colour. <br>
PERI: It's certainly an amazing one. For a sea, that is. Is that this
planet's moon? <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's its twin planet, Thoros Alpha. Come along, then. <br>
PERI: I'll just fetch my galoshes. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, so much fuss over a little water. <br>
PERI: No, but pink water. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you frightened it might clash with what you're wearing? <br>
(Which is a pink top.) <br>
PERI: No, I'm more concerned I might clash with what lives in it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you aren't going to come to any harm. It's quite safe. <br>
(The Doctor steps off the threshold and goes down up to his knees. He
paddles to nearby rocks.) <br>
DOCTOR: As long as you don't hang about. <br>
(Peri closes the door and follows him.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Are you really offering this
inconsequential silliness as evidence? <br>
INQUISITOR: The Doctor has a point. Surely we could join this segment
at a more relevant place? <br>
VALEYARD: My apologies for wasting the court's time, Sagacity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Crunching over the blue and white pebbles on the
beach below the cliff - actually at Peacehaven, East Sussex.) <br>
PERI: I can't get over how weird this place is. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Yes, I suppose it is. <br>
PERI: Difficult to believe there's any industry here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yet this was manufactured here, somewhere. <br>
(The Doctor takes a strange, book-sized contraption from Peri and
fiddles with various switches and sliders.) <br>
DOCTOR: It appears to be multi-functional. Varying fields of energy
projection. Quite advanced. <br>
(He presses a button and a rock dissolves.) <br>
PERI: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: It's more advanced than I thought. It seems it can liquefy as
well as stun. <br>
PERI: Are you sure that thing was made here? <br>
DOCTOR: Peri, a Warlord of Thordon wouldn't use his dying words to lie
to us. Remember what he said? Thoros Beta, send more beams that kill. <br>
PERI: Beams that kill wasn't the only thing he had on his mind. Dirty
old Warlord. Glad we left that place when we did. <br>
DOCTOR: The thing is, how did a bunch of skull-crackers like the
Warlords come to own such a device? <br>
PERI: Does it really matter how they blow each other to bits? <br>
DOCTOR: Matter? Of course it matters. An advanced culture manipulating
the destinies of a less developed civilisation? If that's what's going
on here, it's got to be stopped. <br>
PERI: By us? <br>
DOCTOR: Who else is there? <br>
VALEYARD [OC]: Who else is there? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[</b><b>Trial room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VALEYARD: Your very words condemn you, Doctor,
show your arrogance. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry? <br>
VALEYARD: You feel only you have the right to meddle. Anyone else with
that ambition, according to you, should be stopped. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you'll soon discover I made the right decision. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Thoros Beta]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PERI: You know, I've never seen a tide go out so
quickly. Do you think it's to do with that? <br>
(Thoros Alpha, hanging on the horizon.) <br>
DOCTOR: I shouldn't think so. There must be some sort of mechanical
tide control. <br>
(He spots a square cave opening part way up the cliff.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cave mouth]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: And I wouldn't be at all surprised if it
was housed in here. <br>
PERI: Well, why would they want to control the tide? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, er, why not? Come on. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PERI: Do you think this wise, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: My dear girl, if I stopped to question the wisdom of my
actions, I'd never have left Gallifrey. <br>
PERI: Sometimes I wish you hadn't. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? <br>
PERI: Doctor, look. <br>
(Two artificial box structures on a platform. With no reference I can't
say how big they are. Then something alien grabs Peri from behind. She
screams and coughs. The Doctor frees her then struggles himself with
what might me a giant walking seaweed with big teeth. The weapon in his
hand goes off, freeing him.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VALEYARD: Another death, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: The CD phaser discharged accidentally. Rerun the struggle, see
for yourselves. <br>
VALEYARD: No need. There are clearer examples of your guilt to come. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cave]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> PERI: Why did it attack us? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps it was because of that. <br>
(They walk to the platform.) <br>
PERI: Look, Doctor, I know how you hate me stating the obvious, but
don't you think we should get away from here? <br>
(The boxes turn out to be a good five feet tall.) <br>
PERI: That klaxon's bound to attract someone's attention. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm, yeah. Just a moment, this is incredible. Such
sophistication. <br>
(He opens the doors of one of the boxes.) <br>
PERI: Well, what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: As I suspected, a device for extracting energy from the sea.
Something your planet had the technology to do long before its fossil
fuels ran out, but they didn't bother. This is just an auxiliary
console, though. The main control room must be somewhere else. <br>
PERI: That thing must have been brighter than it looked. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I doubt if that could even tie its own shoelaces. It may
have operated this console, but it certainly didn't build it. <br>
(The klaxon stops.) <br>
PERI: Oh, dear. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, dear. <br>
(The Doctor and Peri are stopped from leaving by a man in a red uniform
tunic, backed up by two armed guards.) <br>
FRAX: Murderers. <br>
PERI: That thing attacked us. <br>
FRAX: The Raak was not programmed to attack. You must have threatened
him. Fetch a stretcher. <br>
DOCTOR: All we did was land here. <br>
FRAX: Where is your submersible? <br>
DOCTOR: Further along the shore. <br>
FRAX: You are part of Crozier's new group? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes, of course. Absolutely. <br>
FRAX: There will have to be an enquiry about this death. <br>
DOCTOR: We will help in any way we can. <br>
FRAX: The Raak was proud of his upgrading. Happy to be in service to
the Mentors. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sure he was. It's a pity he lost his head and decided to
attack us. <br>
PERI: It was an accident. <br>
FRAX: Take him to the dissection lab. There must have been a
regression. They'll want to know why. You will come with us. We will
take you to Crozier's laboratory. When he has verified your identities,
you will be released. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. Security is very important. <br>
FRAX: Glad you agree. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
FRAX: Er, if you don't mind. <br>
(Frax takes the weapon from the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, of course. Can't be too careful. Yes, very good. Absolutely
right. </font></p>

FRAX: You must wait. Crozier cannot be disturbed. <br>
PERI: Oh, what a pity, huh? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, can't wait to see good old Crozier. <br>
FRAX: Old? He is young for a man of science. Perhaps you should
describe Crozier for me. <br>
DOCTOR: Crozier. Well, er, young. Ish. Er, look, shouldn't we attend to
the Raak first? <br>
FRAX: Why? He is dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think it just winked at Peri. <br>
PERI: Oh, cheek. <br>
DOCTOR: No accounting for alien taste. <br>
FRAX: He is dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Not necessarily. Look, may I examine him? You can trust me, I
am a doctor. <br>
FRAX: Like Crozier? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, just like young Crozier. Nurse, could you prepare to apply
the, er, skedaddle test? <br>
PERI: Are you sure that's wise? <br>
DOCTOR: Come round here. I think the alternative could be much worse.
Hold that, will you? Right, ready to apply the test, Sister? <br>
PERI: More than ready, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: On the count of three, then. One, two, three. <br>
(The Doctor and Peri overturn the stretcher and run.) <br>

DOCTOR: Bone. From some animal I don't recognise. Snapped off? Sharp,
jagged edges? <br>
PERI: Doctor, let's go back to the Tardis, huh? <br>
(Something howls nearby.) <br>
PERI: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. <br>
(Peri looks round a corner.) <br>
PERI: Doctor, there. <br>
(Something is cowering, chained to the rock wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's a man. <br>
PERI: Alone. Oh, Doctor, he's chained. <br>
(The man rises and snarls at Peri, exposing very long teeth and a hairy
snout. She screams and the Doctor tackles him from behind with the
bone. They get out of his reach.) <br>
PERI: Are you okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I am now. It also explains how the tooth marks come
to be on this. <br>
PERI: What is he? <br>
DOCTOR: Looks like a man, acts like a wolf. Lycanthropy? <br>
PERI: But how? Good boy, nice dog. Nice man. Can you help us? We're
wondering if you <br>
DOCTOR: Be careful! <br>

DORF: Help me. <br>

DOCTOR: No one following. Yet, that is. <br>
PERI: We must go back. He asked for help. <br>
DOCTOR: Not yet. <br>
PERI: He said, help me. Oh, Doctor, what's going on here? Sea monsters
upgraded to operate machinery, a wolf-man who begged for help. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's find out. <br>
(Dorf howls.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not yet. I have a feeling there are more important
considerations first. <br>
PERI: Who could keep a creature in such torment? <br>
DOCTOR: Who indeed. Someone's coming. <br>
(The Doctor and Peri hide as a guard and Deep Roy lead a procession of
litter bearers carrying three slug-like beings, the last of whom we
have met before on Varos.) <br>
PERI: Did you? <br>
DOCTOR: I did. Well, that explains the CD phaser sales to Thordon.
Sil'd sell anything from bows and arrows to planet disintegrators. <br>
PERI: Why is he here? And those others like him? <br>
DOCTOR: They live here. Thoros Beta's Sil's home planet. Didn't you
know? <br>
PERI: Only because you didn't tell me, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Didn't I? <br>
PERI: You know I'd never want to come within light years of that creep
again. Last time he tried to turn me into a bird woman. <br>
DOCTOR: How could I forget? It cost me a fortune in bird seed. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, even a nervous Time Lord must appear to act with
competence at all times. <br>
VALEYARD: At the risk of his companion's life? <br>
DOCTOR: And his own sometimes. <br>
VALEYARD: Already the unfortunate Peri has survived a struggle with the
Raak, escaped from the guards. And who, Doctor, was sent to examine the
wolf-man? <br>
DOCTOR: Well <br>
VALEYARD: Who went into danger first? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, she just happened to be the nearest. <br>
VALEYARD: Your assistant, as usual. Sagacity, I have calculated on a
random Matrix sample that the Doctor's companions have been placed in
danger twice as often as the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there have been many companions, but only one me. <br>
INQUISITOR: What is the point you're attempting to make, Valeyard? <br>
VALEYARD: That you remember such information when judgement is
considered on taking the Doctor's life and all future regenerations. <br>
INQUISITOR: It is noted. <br>
DOCTOR: This is the most ridiculous, preposterous, travesty of a trial
since the so-called witches of Enderhive. <br>

subduing the massed hordes of the Tonkonp Empire. We must negotiate

We have heard the many requests from the Doctor's companion to withdraw
from the situations we have witnessed, yet constantly, blatantly, they
have been ignored. <br>
DOCTOR: Minor errors of judgement, nothing more. <br>
INQUISITOR: Valeyard, you have asked for the death penalty. That is now
a matter of record. Whereas I do not concur with the prisoner when he
interrupts with the statement that his offences are minor, you will
have to provide this court with far more positive evidence of his guilt
if you wish me to take your plea seriously. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. And my conscience is absolutely clear when I say that
he will be unable to provide such evidence. So, can we please get back
to discussing why Earth was two light years away from its original
position, and what was in the box that Sabalom Glitz was so interested
in? <br>
INQUISITOR: Be silent. <br>

endless repetitions of what we have already seen. <br>

the Valeyard has lost his nerve. He keeps saying that he has the most
damning evidence, but where is it? I suggest to you, my lady, that this
evidence does not exist. Whereas the fact that Earth was two light
years away from its original position is incontrovertible. <br>

a coward, a turncoat. You were afraid that Crozier wanted to transplant
the brain of the alien Kiv into your head. You said as much yourself.
The thought of that made you panic. <br>
DOCTOR: I've told you, it was a ploy. I would never want to harm Peri. <br>
VALEYARD: But you've also admitted that you have no clear memory of the
event. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can recall some of it. Bits of it are beginning to bob
back into my mind. <br>
VALEYARD: Oh, really? And does any of your sudden and convenient recall
agree with anything that the court has already seen? <br>
DOCTOR: No! I mean yes, but, but the emphasis is all wrong. <br>
VALEYARD: And what does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: The events took place but not quite as we've seen them. <br>
INQUISITOR: It occurs to me, Doctor, that your current mental condition
makes it very difficult for you to defend yourself. I would therefore
suggest that this court be adjourned. <br>
DOCTOR: No. And I refute any implication that I'm barmy. <br>
INQUISITOR: Barmy? <br>
VALEYARD: A rather imprecise Earth slang word, Sagacity, implying
psychiatric instability. <br>
INQUISITOR: Thank you, Valeyard. No one is impugning your sanity,
Doctor, merely suggesting your memory is a little faulty. <br>
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, I would like this trial to continue. <br>
INQUISITOR: I was also about to suggest that you might change your mind
and consider availing yourself of a court defender. A trained legal
mind would offer a more constructive and certainly less emotional
presentation of your case. <br>
DOCTOR: If the Time Lords of Gallifrey want my life, you don't think
I'd entrust my defence to one of their august number, do you? <br>

KIV: He looks like a younger me. <br>
SIL: Not quite so handsome, Magnificence. <br>
KIV: Be quiet, Sil. <br>
CROZIER: The features are similar. There is, however, one small
addition. He has retained his primeval sting. His tail contains venom
enough to kill. <br>
KIV: Fascinating. I could perhaps sting all my assistants to death. <br>
SIL: More importantly, are you sure the new skull will be big enough? <br>
CROZIER: The capacity is only a little larger in volume than that of
Lord Kiv. The operation will give us a little time to seek a more
permanent host. <br>

wiggling. Trunk. A neck. Strong. A head free of pain. Eyesight.
Colours. Warm blood inside. Oh, I like this. Now, I am she, alive
within this oh so wonderful, wonderful frame, not that cold-blooded
reptile thing. It must, must die. <br>
CROZIER: It already has. Welcome to your new body. <br>
SIL: I wish you could have found a more attractive one. <br>
(Outside, Yrcanos and Tuza deal with the two guards in their slow-ish
motion fight. Yrcanos takes a phaser and bursts in.) <br>
YRCANOS: Ragna! <br>
(Yrcanos fires at Sil's cot. Peri-Kiv sits up.) <br>
PERI: Protect me. I am your lord and master. <br>
(Yrcanos stares at the bald Peri and aims the phaser at her.) <br>
YRCANOS: No! No! No! <br>
(He fires at everyone he can see as the picture blurs.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: You killed Peri? <br>
INQUISITOR: We had to act. With the discovery that Crozier had made,
the whole course of natural evolution throughout the universe would be
affected. <br>
VALEYARD: But Peri died, Doctor, because you abandoned her. We had to
end her life because your negligence had made it impossible for her to
live. <br>
DOCTOR: Lies. There's something else going on here. The High Council
has no right to order Peri's or anyone else's death. <br>
INQUISITOR: Please, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I was taken out of time for another reason, and I have
every intention of finding out what it is. </font></p>
