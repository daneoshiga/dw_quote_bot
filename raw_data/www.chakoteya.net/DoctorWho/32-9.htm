residents are making their way home for the night. An old woman
struggles to get her shopping trolley up the steps to the lift. A
little boy in his pajamas can hear the noise it makes as it travels in
its shaft next to his bedroom wall) <br>
CLAIRE: Bed. <br>
GEORGE: But Mum <br>
CLAIRE: George, I won't tell you again. Get into bed. I'm going to be
late for work. It's just the lift, love. How many more times? <br>
GEORGE: Don't like it. <br>
(Mum Claire is a nurse.) <br>
CLAIRE: Well, what do we do with the things we don't like? We <br>
BOTH: Put them in the cupboard. <br>
GEORGE: The thing. You have to do the thing, Mum. <br>
(She switches his bedroom light on and off four times.) <br>
GEORGE: Five times. It has to be five times. <br>
(George closes his eyes and prays.) <br>
GEORGE: Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the
monsters. Please save me from the monsters. <br>
CLAIRE: All right now? Come on, George. There's nothing to be scared
of. Night, night then, love.

CLAIRE: He's in bed at least. <br>

CLAIRE: He needs help. <br>

RORY: But we could get a bus somewhere like this. <br>
DOCTOR: The exact opposite. <br>
AMY: Well, I suppose it can't all be planets and history and stuff,
Rory. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it can. Course it can. Planets and history and stuff.
That's what we do. But not today. No. Today, we're answering a cry for
help from the scariest place in the universe. A child's bedroom. </font></p>

shopping trolley, and her asthmatic breathing as she goes past his

RORY: Please save me from the monsters? Who sent that? <br>
DOCTOR: That's what we're here to find out. <br>
AMY: Sounds like something a kid would say. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. A scared kid. A very scared kid. So scared that
somehow its cry for help got through to us in the Tardis. <br>
AMY: Yeah, but you've traced it here. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Ah. Going up.

photographs rather than watching the box. Sounds like the One Show or
something equally inane.) <br>
TELEVISION: Now, did you know there that there are twice as many pets
as people here in the UK? Now that's a lot of animals and we want to
know how clever they are. Now, if you were watching BBC1 on Saturday
night, you will have seen Rolf Harris and Kate Humble <br>

more frightened.)

answers the one Amy is at, while the Doctor gets Mrs Rossiter.) <br>
AMY: Hi. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
(And Rory gets a grumpy man.) <br>
AMY: Are your mummy and daddy in, or is it just you? <br>
(The door opens wider to reveal twin girls.) <br>
AMY: Okay. <br>
MRS ROSSITER: Is it about the bins? <br>
DOCTOR: Pardon? <br>
RORY: Community support. Just checking up on community-based things. <br>
(The twins mother speaks to Amy.) <br>
JULIE: Can I help you? <br>
AMY: Hi. Er, yeah. No, sorry. I was just wondering if you've had any
bother around here? <br>
RORY: Is everything okay? <br>
MRS ROSSITER: The bins. I can't be expected to get down all them
stairs. I need new knees. <br>
JULIE: Bother? What do you mean? <br>
AMY: Well, I mean <br>
RORY: Are your neighbours nice? Do you get on well? <br>
JULIE: He didn't send you, did he? <br>
AMY: Who? <br>
PURCELL: Jim Purcell. Course we get on well. I'm their landlord. They
love me, don't they? <br>
RORY: You're the landlord? <br>
DOCTOR: Not the bins, no, Miss? <br>
MRS ROSSITER: Mrs Rossiter. <br>
PURCELL: I thought you'd know that, being from community support. <br>
RORY: Yeah. Yes. Yes, of course. Sorry. <br>
MRS ROSSITER: I've already got a new hip. I'll be able to manage when I
get the knees. Up and down them stairs like Sherpa Tensing, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Can I come in? <br>
(Purcell's dog snaps at Rory.) <br>
RORY: Oh. <br>
MRS ROSSITER: Course not. You could be anyone. <br>
DOCTOR: I could be, but I'm not. <br>
RORY: Or maybe it's best if I come back another time. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. <br>
(Three doors are slammed in three faces. George looks out through his
window as Rory and Amy walk along the landing.) <br>
AMY: We've got to find that kid. <br>
RORY: Maybe we should let the monsters gobble him up. <br>
(Across the way, the Doctor spots George.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[By the lift]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMY: Hey. Any luck? <br>
DOCTOR: Three old ladies, a traffic warden from Croatia and a man with
ten cats. <br>
RORY: What are we actually looking for? <br>
DOCTOR: Ten cats. Scared kid, remember? <br>
AMY: I found scary kids. Does that count? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, try the next floor down. Catch you later. <br>
AMY: Okay. <br>
RORY: Maybe it was, you know, junk mail. <br>
AMY: What? <br>
RORY: The message on the psychic paper. Maybe it was just nothing. <br>
(They get into the lift, Amy presses 4 and it drops like a stone. The
floor indicator suggests they were originally above floor 12. When the
lift arrives at G, the doors open and the lift is empty.)

soon as Alex opens the door.) <br>
ALEX: Oh. Right. That was quick. <br>
DOCTOR: Was it? <br>
(He checks the paper.) <br>
ALEX: Claire said she'd phone someone. Social Services. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes. <br>
ALEX: It's not easy, you know, admitting your kid's got a problem. <br>
DOCTOR: You've got a problem. I've got a problem. I bet they're
connected, I'm the Doctor. Call me Doctor. What can I call you? <br>
ALEX: Alex. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Alex. <br>
(He steps inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: So, tell me about George. <br>
(There is a label on the nearest door - George's room. Inside, George
is still scaring himself by making nasty shadows.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Mrs Rossiter has dragged her black rubbish bag
down and outside to the communal
bins. There are other bin bags piled up by the metal containers.) <br>
MRS ROSSITER: What a blooming mess. I'm the only one who gives a
monkeys round here any more. Shocking. Talking to yourself now, Elsie.
They say it's the first sign. <br>
(Something moves amongst the bags.) <br>
MRS ROSSITER: Oh, Lord. Come out of there! Don't be so ruddy horrible,
trying to scare an old lady to death. It's not right. Is that you,
George? I'll tell your mum and dad. Come on, you little devil. Let's
see your face. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is looking through the family albums.) <br>
ALEX: Ever since he was born he's been a funny kid. <br>
DOCTOR: Funny's good. We like funny, don't we? <br>
ALEX: He never cries. Bottles it all up, I suppose. Tell him off, he
just looks at you. <br>
DOCTOR: How old is he? <br>
ALEX: He was eight in January. I mean, he should be growing out of
stuff like this, shouldn't he? <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe. It's got worse, though lately? <br>
ALEX: Yeah. We talked about getting help. You know, maybe sending him
somewhere. He started getting these nervous tics. You know, funny
little cough, blinking all the time. But now it's got completely out of
hand. I mean, he's scared to death of everything. <br>
DOCTOR: Pantaphobia. <br>
ALEX: What? <br>
DOCTOR: That's what it's called. Pantaphobia. Not a fear of pants
though, if that's what you're thinking. It's a fear of everything.
Including pants, I suppose, in that case. Sorry. Go on. <br>
ALEX: He hates clowns. <br>
DOCTOR: Understandable. <br>
ALEX: Old toys. He thinks the old lady across the way is a witch. He
hates having a bath in case there's something under the water.
The lift sounds like someone breathing. Look, I don't know. I'm not an
expert. Maybe you can get through to him. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll do my best.

RORY: You okay? <br>
AMY: Yeah, I think so. <br>
RORY: What happened to the lift? We were in a lift, weren't we? <br>
AMY: Yeah, yeah. We. I remember getting in and then. What? <br>

RORY: You know, it's obvious what's happened. <br>
AMY: Yeah? Really? Because it's not obvious to me. <br>
RORY: The Tardis has gone funny again. Some time slippy thing. You
know, The Doctor's back there in Eastenders-land and we're stuck here
in the past. This is probably seventeen hundred and something. <br>
AMY: Yay. My favourite year. <br>

the door moves, George jumps and knocks his bedside lamp over.) <br>
ALEX: George? You okay? What's the matter? Oh. Never mind. Were you
having a nightmare, son? <br>
GEORGE: Wasn't a nightmare. I wasn't asleep. Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. <br>
GEORGE: A doctor? Have you come to take me away? <br>

of ovens. Amy walks into some fire irons and makes a clatter.) <br>
AMY: A bit neglected, wherever it is. <br>

we are. When we are. <br>
(Amy picks up a pan and taps it.) <br>
AMY: Rory? <br>
RORY: Hmm? <br>
AMY: Look at this. <br>
RORY: Well, it's a copper pan. <br>
AMY: No, it's not. It's wood. It's made of wood and just painted to
look like copper. <br>
RORY: That is stupid. <br>
AMY: Wait. Hang on. <br>

AMY: There's a switch. <br>

RORY: Wow. Well, not seventeen hundred and something, then. <br>
(They open drawers in a sideboard.) <br>
AMY: It's glass. It's a glass eye. <br>

DOCTOR: Right. <br>
ALEX: Scary stuff, getting under his skin, frightening him. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm-hmm. <br>
ALEX: We stopped letting him watch. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you don't want to do that. <br>
ALEX: Then Claire thought it might have been something he was reading. <br>
DOCTOR: Great. Reading's great. You like stories, George? Yeah? Me,
too. When I was your age, about, ooo, a thousand years ago, I loved a
good bedtime story. The Three Little Sontarans. The Emperor Dalek's New
Clothes. Snow White And The Seven Keys To Doomsday, eh? All the
classics. <br>
(He throws the Rubik's cube away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rubbish. Must be broken. I hate those things. Better tidy it
away, though, eh? How about in here? No. Not in the cupboard. Why not
in there, George? <br>
ALEX: It's a thing. A thing we got him doing ages back. Anything that
frightens him, we put it in the cupboard. Creepy toys, scary pictures,
that sort of thing. <br>
DOCTOR: And is that where the monsters go? Yeah. There's nothing to be
scared of, George. It's just a cupboard. <br>

PURCELL [OC]: You know how I hate to mention it, but it's that time
again. <br>
ALEX [OC]: Yes. <br>
PURCELL [OC]: And you know I like my money prompt. <br>
ALEX [OC]: The thing is, I still haven't found anywhere since the shop
shut, and Claire's wage only goes so far. I thought we could, you know,
come to some sort of arrangement. <br>

GEORGE: Is that a torch? <br>

Stay away from cupboard. And there's something else. Something I've
missed. Something staring me in the face. <br>

worse. Will you stop making tea. I want you to leave. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>

maybe this was a bad idea. We should sort out George ourselves. <br>

you are or what wheels have been set in motion. We'll sort it. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not just a professional. I'm the Doctor. <br>
ALEX: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It means I've come a long way to get here, Alex. A very long
way. George sent a message. A distress call, if you like. Whatever's
inside that cupboard is so terrible, so powerful, that it amplified the
fears of an ordinary little boy across all the barriers of time and
space. <br>
ALEX: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Through crimson stars and silent stars and tumbling nebulas
like oceans set on fire. Through empires of glass and civilizations of
pure thought, and a whole, terrible, wonderful universe of
impossibilities. You see these eyes? They're old eyes. And one thing I

ALEX: Well, I told you. Just turned eight. <br>
DOCTOR: So you remember when he was born, then? <br>
ALEX: Of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Course you do. How could you not? You and Claire. Christmas
Eve, 2002, right? <br>
ALEX: What? Er yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Couple of weeks before George was born. Tell me about the day
he arrived. Must have been wonderful. <br>
ALEX: Well, it was the best day of my (big pause) life. <br>
DOCTOR: Sure? <br>
ALEX: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't sound sure. <br>
ALEX: What are you trying to say? Look, I don't like this. I've told
you before, I want you to go. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter, Alex? <br>
ALEX: I can't. Oh, don't. Oh, this is scary. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Alex, this is scary. Claire with baby George. Newborn, yes?
<br>
ALEX: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Less than a month after Christmas. <br>
ALEX: So? <br>
DOCTOR: So look. Look. Claire's not pregnant. <br>
ALEX: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Not pregnant. <br>
ALEX: Well, of course not. Claire can't have kids! <br>
DOCTOR: Say that again. <br>
ALEX: We tried everything. She was desperate. As much IVF as we could
afford, but. Claire can't have kids. How? How can I have forgotten
that? <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you, George? <br>
ALEX: It's not possible. This isn't <br>
DOCTOR: George? <br>
(The lift makes his toys shake. The bedside lamp glows brightly all of
a sudden, then the cupboard door flies open. A white light floods out
and grabs Alex and the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: George! George, what's going on? Are you doing it? <br>
ALEX: What's happening? <br>
GEORGE: Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the
monsters. Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the
monsters. <br>
DOCTOR: George, no! <br>
GEORGE: Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the
monsters. Please save me from the monsters. <br>
ALEX: Help me, Doctor! <br>

fruit, chickens. Wood. So, we're either inside the dolls' house or this

Responded to that need. What could do that? <br>

I've been round and re-built them as bigger blocks. Super blocks. And
I've been round them as well. I can't remember everything. <br>

ALEX: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: What do you tell George to do, Alex, with everything that
scares him? <br>
ALEX: Well, put it in the cupboard. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. And George isn't just an ordinary little boy, we know
that now, so anything scary he puts in here. Scary toys, like the
dolls' house. Scary noises, like, like the lift. Even his little
rituals have become part of it. A psychic repository for all his fears,
but what is he? <br>

DOCTOR: A cuckoo. A cuckoo in the nest. A Tenza. He's a Tenza. Millions
of them hatch in space and then whoomph, off they drift, looking for a
nest. The Tenza young can sense exactly what their foster parents want
and then they assimilate perfectly. <br>

instinctively and sought you out, but something scared him. Started
this cycle of fear. It's all completely instinctive, subconscious.
