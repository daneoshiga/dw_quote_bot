grapes. The Doctor is also in local garb, watering a pot plant) <br>
DOCTOR: So you're awake at last, young man. <br>
IAN: No need to say it like that, Doctor. I thought the whole idea of
us coming here was that we should all have a nice rest. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, there's a great deal of difference between resting
and being sort of, bone idle! <br>
IAN: Well, have a grape. <br>
DOCTOR: No, thank you, I've had my breakfast. <br>
IAN: Where are Barbara and Vicki? They gone down to the village? Don't
you think that plant's had enough water, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: The answer, dear boy, is pipes. <br>
IAN: Pipes? <br>
DOCTOR: Pipes, Chesterton, pipes! <br>
IAN: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: You see, the Romans, unfortunately, didn't know how to
transport water satisfactorily. That's why they built their aqueducts.
Now, if they'd experimented with pipes. <br>
IAN: Oh, I see what you're getting at, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good, yes, yes, they have. <br>
IAN: I beg your pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear young man, why do you let your mind wander so? You
asked me just now if Barbara and Vicki had gone down to the village. I
gave you a plain and simple answer. Yes, they have.

road is very smooth and well paved) <br>
VICKI: Come on, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, Vicki, there's no need to be in such a hurry. The village
isn't going to run away. Phew, its so hot. <br>
VICKI: It's just that I want to get there before the market closes. <br>
BARBARA: All right, we'll get there, but not so fast. <br>
(Barbara sits on a convenient bench) <br>
VICKI: Oh, come on. Honestly, you're getting as bad as Ian. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, what's that supposed to mean? <br>
VICKI: Well, the way you spoke I thought we were going to have
adventures and see things. We've been here nearly a month and all
everyone wants to do is sit around and rest. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, Vicki. Look, the adventures come without us looking for
them. And you're finding out what it was like to live in Roman times. <br>
VICKI: Oh, yes, in one little village miles away from Rome. <br>
(in the bushes, a man unsheathes his dagger) <br>
VICKI [OC]: How much longer do you think the Doctor will stay here,
Barbara? <br>
BARBARA [OC]: Oh, I've no idea. You can never tell with the Doctor. You
just have to wait and see. <br>
VICKI [OC]: What are you going to buy at the market?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A white-haired man is playing a lyre as two men
with heavy cloaks look around the bustling market) <br>
DIDIUS: (a small man with a beard) This is too small a place,
Sevcheria. I can't see us finding what we want here. <br>
SEVCHERIA: (bigger, with a deep voice) It's our last chance before
Rome. <br>
DIDIUS: Why? We pass through much bigger towns. <br>
SEVCHERIA: Yes, and with legal representation. If we raid them, the
repercussions will put us out of business. <br>
DIDIUS: Then let's go back. <br>
SEVCHERIA: Didius, the slaves we've already brought from Gaul are in no
condition for further travel, and the quality is such we shall have to
take far below the market price as it is. <br>
(Barbara and Vicki arrive, and get noticed) <br>
DIDIUS: The two women. Yes, very suitable, I agree. I doubt even the
possibility. <br>
SEVCHERIA: It will do no harm to make enquiries, Didius. <br>
VICKI: This would make a nice dress. Don't you think so, Barbara? <br>
BARBARA: Are you any good at dressmaking? <br>
VICKI: No, but I thought you might be. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, I see. Well, what sort of style would you like? <br>
VICKI: I don't know. What were the fashions like when you left London? <br>
BARBARA: London? Never heard of it. <br>
VICKI: But you told me that that's where you came from. <br>
BARBARA: Ah, you mean Londinium. When in Rome? <br>
SELLER: (a woman) Can I help you? <br>
VICKI: Yes, how much is this, please? <br>
SELLER: Well, now, what would you consider to be a fair price? Bearing
in mind it's the only length of its kind and the finest quality
available. <br>
VICKI: Yes, I know but how much are you asking? <br>
SELLER: Well, its very difficult to put a price on something like this.
It's very hard to come by. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, I'm sure it is. We'll think about it and come back later.
<br>
SELLER: Hey, one moment, please! <br>
VICKI: Barbara, please, can't we buy it? <br>
BARBARA: You should have learned by now that the price is much fairer
when you're not so eager to buy. <br>
VICKI: What? Can we go back and buy it now? <br>
BARBARA: No, not just yet. <br>
SEVCHERIA: Good day to you. A fine selection. <br>
SELLER: None finer this side of Rome. <br>
SEVCHERIA: No, thank you. My friend and I are not interested in buying
cloth today. We are buying information. <br>
DIDIUS: The two who were just here. Do you know them? <br>
SELLER: By sight, not name. <br>
DIDIUS: But they do live here? <br>
SELLER: Yes. They moved into a villa just north of the town about a
month ago. The owner, Flavius Guiscard is away campaigning in Gaul. We
reckon they're friends of his looking after the house. <br>
SEVCHERIA: How many of them are there? <br>
(coins change hands) <br>
SELLER: Four. There are two men with them. <br>
DIDIUS: Young? <br>
(more coins) <br>
SELLER: One of them is. They sell the produce of the gardens to the
townsfolk here. Very cheaply too. They must be fools. <br>
SEVCHERIA: But you've no idea where they come from? <br>
SELLER: None. At least, not until today. (coin) One of the women
mentioned a town. Londinium, I think she said. Do you know it? <br>
SEVCHERIA: Thank you. You have been most helpful. <br>
DIDIUS: The town they spoke of is in a place they call Britannia. <br>
SEVCHERIA: They are Britons. Perfect.

BARBARA: Well, the main course was breast of peacock. <br>
IAN: Delicious. <br>
BARBARA: With an orange and juniper sauce. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, exquisite. <br>
BARBARA: Garnished with larks tongues and baked pomegranates <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, fabulous, my dear, absolutely fabulous. What was it we had
before, the sort of hors d'oeuvres, so to speak? <br>
VICKI: That isn't its name. French isn't invented yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Tut, tut, tut, tut child. Barbara, what was it? Hmm? <br>
BARBARA: Ant's eggs in hibiscus honey. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. What did you say? <br>
IAN: Ant's eggs, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I thought she said. Ant's eggs. What do you
think I am, a goldfish, hmm? <br>
IAN: Doctor, there's one thing I wanted to ask you. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, go ahead my boy. <br>
IAN: Now, er, what about the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what about it, hmm? <br>
IAN: Well, don't you think we ought to go and have a look at it? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, so you want to move on, do you? <br>
IAN: Move on? Certainly not. I'd like to stay here as long as possible.
<br>
DOCTOR: Good, that's settled. Settled. Fine. <br>
BARBARA: All the same, Doctor, I know what Ian means. It's been three
or four weeks since we left the Tardis. <br>
IAN: Yes, it's not even the right way up. <br>
DOCTOR: How many times do I have to tell you that the Tardis is quite
safe where it is. It can take off from any angle. I've never known such
a pair of worriers. Really. Good heavens, I can't wait to get away for
a couple of days from you. You keep on and on and on and on and on.
Gracious me, really. <br>
(the Doctor leaves) <br>
IAN: Going away? Do you know anything about this? <br>
BARBARA: No. Not a thing. <br>
IAN: Vicki? <br>
VICKI: No, he hasn't said anything to me. Can't say I blame him though.
<br>
BARBARA: Blame him for what? <br>
VICKI: Well, its all right living here, but its boring! No wonder he
gets irritable. <br>
IAN: Ha. That's got nothing to do with living here, believe me. Doctor?
You there? <br>
(The Doctor re-enters and fills a bag with food from the table) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think these should last me two or three days, hmm? <br>
IAN: You never told us you were going away. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? Well, I don't know that I was under any obligation to
report my movements to you, Chesterfield. <br>
BARBARA: Chesterton. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Barbara's calling you. <br>
VICKI: Where are you going, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: To Rome, my child. <br>
VICKI: Oh, can I come with you? I won't be any trouble, I promise. Can
I? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I. <br>
VICKI: Please? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Very well, then, very well, <br>
IAN: Well, perhaps we'd all better come with you to Rome. <br>
DOCTOR: But my dear chap, you just turned down my invitation. <br>
IAN: I did? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you said how glad you would be to stay here as long as
possible. <br>
BARBARA: Oh no, Doctor, that was before we knew your plans. Don't you
think it would be safer if Ian and I <br>
DOCTOR: What is this, what is this now? I know what you're insinuating.
Yes, that I'm not capable of taking care of myself, ay? Huh! Safer
indeed. Afraid to let me out of your sight, are you? Want to be my
nursemaids? Well now, let me tell me something. I won't stand for it.
Indeed, I will not stand for it. You want to go to Rome? Go. Go
yourselves. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, if you feel that <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, my dear, come along. Let's set about our
packing, shall we? Come on, then. Yes, you know, this is going to be
your first exploration. You know, I think you'll like Rome. Rome is
fascinating, most interesting. I remember once when I was there and I
spoke to <br>
(Doctor and Vicki leave) <br>
BARBARA: Well, I certainly said the wrong thing. <br>
IAN: Oh, don't worry, Barbara. Anything you'd said would have been
wrong. <br>
BARBARA: I suppose we're lucky really to have kept him inactive as long
as we have. <br>
IAN: True, true. Still, he can say what he likes. He's enjoyed this
rest as much as any of us. <br>
(Barbara is gazing at him) <br>
IAN: What's the matter? My slip showing? <br>
BARBARA: No, I was just thinking what a splendid looking Roman you
make. <br>
IAN: Oh. Well, yes, if I wasn't so modest, I'd agree with you. <br>
BARBARA: It's a pity there's just one thing out of place. <br>
IAN: Oh, where? <br>
BARBARA: That hair. <br>
IAN: Hmm? <br>
BARBARA: It just doesn't go with those clothes. <br>
IAN: Oh, yes, I know that but I <br>
BARBARA: Come and sit down. <br>
IAN: Ay? <br>
BARBARA: Come and sit down. <br>
(She gets a comb with very long teeth out of a bag) <br>
IAN: Now just a minute, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: It won't hurt, I got it in the market specially. <br>
IAN: Yes, but which market? (he falls off the seat) Ow! <br>
BARBARA: Oh, don't be such a baby. Come here. <br>
(she combs his hair forward, Roman-style) <br>
IAN: How long do you think the Doctor will be away? <br>
BARBARA: No idea. Why? <br>
IAN: Well, the owner of this house could come back before he does. I
ouch. That hurts, you know! <br>
BARBARA: Sorry. Well, if he does come back, we can always go back to
the Tardis. There. How's that? <br>
IAN: Feels awful. <br>
BARBARA: Well, why don't you go and look in the spring? <br>
(he checks his reflection in the fountain) <br>
IAN: Hey. Hey, that's not too bad. <br>
BARBARA: Well, it's all part of the service. I take in washing too. <br>
IAN: Not bad at all. (declaims Antony's speech from <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/julius_caesar/julius_caesar.3.2.html">Act
3, Scene 2 of Julius Caesar</a>) Friends, Romans, countrymen!

VICKI: Oh, the poor man. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he's dead, and it doesn't look a natural death to me. <br>
VICKI: It's a lonely stretch of road. Maybe he was set upon by robbers?
They did happen in this time, didn't they? <br>
DOCTOR: They did, my dear, yes, but that isn't the answer here. (picks
up the lyre.) They've left his belongings too. <br>
VICKI: Maybe they didn't have time.&nbsp;<br>

DOCTOR: Well, you can easily kill someone. Swords are dangerous, you
know. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, yes, thank you, that's better. Now tell me, whom or what,
er, you, er, were you looking for? <br>

DOCTOR: And what if it is, hmm? <br>
CENTURION: Why, it's you I'm looking for. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I see. Yes. <br>
CENTURION: You must be Maximus Pettulian from Corinth, whose skill as a
musician is talked of even in Rome. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Most interesting. <br>
CENTURION: We expected you in Assessium yesterday. When you failed to
arrive, I sent my men out to search for you. I count it my good fortune
that I've personally found you unharmed. <br>
DOCTOR: If I am the man you're looking for, tell me why should I be
harmed, hmm? <br>
CENTURION: All roads to Rome are dangerous for travellers. When you
sent word that you intended to make your way on foot, playing your lyre
for the people, it caused great concern at court. <br>
DOCTOR: At court? <br>
CENTURION: Caesar Nero's court. The Emperor of all Rome is very
concerned for your safe arrival. He looks forward to discussing your
music with you. <br>
DOCTOR: The Emperor. Nero, eh? Ha, ha, yes, of course, I have heard
that he that he plucks a string or two. Yes, yes. Oh, the child, she
travels with me. She keeps her eye on all the lyres. <br>
CENTURION: Then if you're ready, we'll travel to Assessium and then my
men will escort you the rest of the way. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well, we'll just attend to our imprimatur. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, I know this <br>
DOCTOR: At court, I must be very important. <br>
VICKI: Listen, I know he's mistaken you for that man, but we can't go
with him. <br>
DOCTOR: But why not, my child? I'm sure he knows more about this
business than he admits. And we shall never get a better chance of
meeting Nero. <br>
VICKI: But Doctor, you don't even know your own name. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, of course I do, my dear. It, it, it, it's <br>

DOCTOR: Young lady, why did you have to come in and interrupt? Just as
I'd got him all softened up and ready for the old one, two. <br>
VICKI: You're all right then? <br>
DOCTOR: All right? Of course, I'm all right, my child. You know, I am
so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights
and satisfaction of the arts, the gentle art of fisticuffs. <br>
VICKI: I realise you're a man of many talents, Doctor, but I didn't
know fighting was one of them. <br>

DOCTOR: Why not? What, him? Oh, my dear child, I don't think he'll come
back again. Oh, no. I think I can promise you that. <br>
VICKI: Oh, Doctor, I was coming to tell you another thing. You know the
Centurion who brought us here? He seems to have gone, too. <br>

to kill me. Or rather to kill this fellow, Maximus what is it? Er. <br>
VICKI: Pettulian. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
VICKI: Pettulian. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course, yes. I must remember that name. Yes.
Goodnight. <br>
VICKI: But Doctor, if he wanted you dead, why didn't he take care of it
himself? <br>
DOCTOR: Because this way he couldn't be charged with crime. <br>
VICKI: Yes, but if you were going to be killed anyway, I can't see that
it <br>
DOCTOR: My dear, it was an accepted thing in this age to hire an
assassin. Preferably, preferably someone dumb, and then he couldn't
denounce you. <br>
VICKI: Ah, so he must have been looking in the bushes for the body when
we first met him. <br>
DOCTOR: Just as I suspected at the time. Now, goodnight. And remember,
we make an early start tomorrow. <br>
VICKI: You don't mean to say we're going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, goodness me, goodness me, child, how you do talk. Yes, we
are. <br>
VICKI: But they might try and kill you again. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course they might. But who am I to worry about such
little things like that, hmm? Now then, there's one thing you've got to
learn about me. When I say we go to Rome, then we go to Rome.
Goodnight.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Nero's chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is wearing his glasses to look at a
diagram on parchment) <br>
DOCTOR: You know what this is, child, don't you, hmm? <br>
VICKI: Plans? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Caesar Nero made it. The rebuilding of Rome. Let me see,
where are we now? 64AD, July. Yes, of course. He sets fire to Rome. <br>
VICKI: I know about that, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he must, I expect his plan will be ready at any time now. <br>
TAVIUS: Psst. Maximus! <br>
DOCTOR: Must you hiss my name from all corners, hmm? <br>
TAVIUS: I'm sorry, but I have news. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
TAVIUS: Nero has arranged for you to play in the arena. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, has he now? Well, I must have misjudged the fellow. <br>
TAVIUS: And as you play the lions will be released. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that will be charming. <br>
TAVIUS: Well, obviously you must leave here before this concert. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, obviously, hmm. <br>
TAVIUS: So if you still intend to carry on with your plan, today is
your last chance to kill Nero. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Kill Nero? I beg your pardon? <br>
TAVIUS: Maximus, when you first sent word from Corinth of your
intention to murder the Caesar Nero, I informed your allies in the
court. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, you did, did you? Yes. <br>
TAVIUS: Then, when the assassins left here to waylay you on your
journey, naturally I thought that was the end. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but I arrived here, hmm? <br>
TAVIUS: Yes, Maximus, you arrived here. <br>
DOCTOR: And the Centurion who was killed by my allies, was the man that
knew all about my plans and Nero didn't? <br>
TAVIUS: Yes, yes, we all know that, but my main concern now, Maximus,
is that you should act on what I say. <br>
DOCTOR: I shall certainly act on what you say, immediately. <br>
TAVIUS: Good, good, good. And the lions will go hungry after all, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! <br>
(Tavius leaves) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that settles that little bit of intrigue. I'm a would-be
murderer, am I? Well, we must be going, child. I want to leave here as
soon as it's dark. <br>
VICKI: Oh, but Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, now, there'll be no arguments. You will do as I say. <br>
(Nero enters) <br>
NERO: Maximus, my dear friend! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear Caesar Nero. <br>
NERO: I have a surprise for you. Guess what it is. <br>
DOCTOR: Well now, let me think. You want me play in the arena? <br>
NERO: You guessed. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's no problem at all, after all, you want to do your
very best for your fellow artists, well, why not the arena, hmm? <br>
NERO: Yes, yes, of course, that is exactly right. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well I promise you I shall try to make it a roaring
success. <br>
NERO: You'll have to play something special, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, of course, of course, yes. Something serious, yes.
Something they can really get their teeth into, hmm? <br>
NERO: You can't know, you can't. I've told no one. <br>
DOCTOR: Caesar Nero, I've always wanted to put on a good show, to give
a great performance. <br>
(behind the Doctor's back, the sun's ray are magnified by his glasses
and set fire to the plans) <br>
DOCTOR: After all, who knows? If I go down well, I might even make it
my farewell performance. You see, I've always wanted to be considered
as an artist of some taste. Generally regarded as, er, well er,
palatable, hmm? But I must be boring you, oh I must! Surely you have so
many other important things to attend to without standing here, chewing
over the facts with me? Good gracious, there's something burning. <br>
NERO: My plans! My drawings for New Rome! You fool! You idiot! <br>
(Vicki tries to put out the flames with the curtains) <br>
NERO: A lifetime's work! I'll have you both killed over and over again!
Guards! Guards! Fool! Idiot! Traitor! Pig! I'll stick you both in the
arena, on an island with water all round, and in the water there will
be alligators and the water level will be raised and the alligators
will get you! Fool! Traitor! Brilliant! You are a genius! A genius! I
will make you rich! Rich! So the Senate wouldn't pass my plans, eh?
Wouldn't let me build my New Rome? But if the old one is burnt, if it
goes up in flames, they will have no choice! Rome will be rebuilt to my
design! Brilliant! Brilliant! <br>
(Nero leaves, carrying the parchment torch) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there you are, release us. You heard what Nero said.
Brilliant, brilliant. Let us go, will you, otherwise you'll be getting
some of that alligator treatment. Go on, on your way. About your
business. Go along. <br>
(The guards leave) <br>
DOCTOR: We'd better be going, child and I want to leave here as soon as
it's dark. <br>
VICKI: I didn't think that was going to work. <br>
DOCTOR: Wasn't going to work? What next. I never had any doubt in my
mind, my dear.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NERO: Fantastic! Brilliant! It's a fantastic idea,
Poppaea. <br>
POPPAEA: Well, if it's your idea, dearest, it must be. <br>
NERO: Well, nearly all mine, dear. You know how I've always longed to
rebuild Rome, name it after myself. <br>
POPPAEA: Yes, I know. <br>
NERO: At last, here's a chance of making it all come true. Burn the old
one, and the cynics will have to pass my plans. It is a good idea,
isn't it? <br>
POPPAEA: Yes, very. <br>
NERO: Did you want me? <br>
POPPAEA: Only to find out why the Palace has been surrounded by guards.
<br>
NERO: Guards? Oh, yes, of course, yes. That new slave of yours, that
girl, she and some of her friends are coming here tonight. They'll be
captured and killed. I must, get someone to start the fires. Tonight.
No time like the present.

NERO: Well, pick them up then. <br>
DELOS: What's going on, Ian? <br>
IAN: I don't know. I tell you one thing, if I get the chance, I'm going
to find Barbara. <br>
NERO: That's enough. Silence! That was just a sample. There will be
more for you, if you carry out the task that I have for you. I want you
men to start fires in the hutments next to the circus. The fire will
spread quickly. By tonight, all Rome will be ablaze. Kill anyone who
tries to stop you. You are acting on orders from Caesar Nero, Emperor
of all Rome! <br>
TAVIUS: You are Ian? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
TAVIUS: Come with me. <br>
NERO: Then, the rebuilding will commence. A new city will arise from
the flames. Neropolis? Nerocaesum? Or just plain Nero!

DOCTOR: Oh. The great fire of Rome, my dear. Hmm? <br>
VICKI: My first real sight of history. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, a most memorable occasion. <br>
VICKI: Isn't it strange to think that people will read about that in
books for thousands and thousands of years and here am I sitting here
actually watching it. It's a pity they got it all wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Got it all wrong? What do you mean, child, hmm? <br>
VICKI: Well, they didn't mention you. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course not. Why should they? <br>
VICKI: Well, it was you who gave Nero the idea, wasn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: I? Gave him? <br>
VICKI: Honestly, Doctor, and after that long talk you gave me about not
meddling with history, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: It's got nothing to do with me. <br>
VICKI: You burnt his drawings. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, an accident. <br>
VICKI: Well, maybe it was but if you hadn't <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he could have, he could have, he would have been told
someone else. You can't possibly accuse me of that. <br>
VICKI: All right, you have it your way, I'll have it mine. <br>

all this is my fault. Hmm? My fault. <br>

them. <br>

IAN: Yes, so am I. Er, Barbara, there must be a bit of that cold
peacock of yours left in the fridge. <br>
BARBARA: Hey, you're right! <br>
IAN: Why don't you have a look? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, very funny! Instead of sitting there making stupid jokes,
why don't you get yourself cleaned up? As a matter of fact, you can
start with this. <br>
