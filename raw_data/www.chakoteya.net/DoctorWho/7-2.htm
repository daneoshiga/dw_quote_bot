LAWRENCE: I trust that point is clear. And I would emphasise again that
despite the presence of our friends from UNIT, to whom we shall give
every possible co-operation, this problem is, I am sure, a scientific
one. <br>

BRIGADIER: Gentlemen, my colleagues, Miss Elizabeth Shaw and the
Doctor. Doctor Lawrence, director of this establishment. <br>
LAWRENCE: How do you do. <br>
BRIGADIER: His number two, Doctor Quinn. <br>
QUINN: Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Doctor Quinn. <br>
BRIGADIER: Major Baker, station security officer. Doctor Lawrence,
perhaps you'd be good enough to put my colleagues in the picture. <br>
LAWRENCE: This establishment consists basically of a device for
research into the nature of the atom. Cyclotron, otherwise known as a
proton accelerator. It, er <br>
(The Doctor wanders round the room.) <br>
LAWRENCE: It bombards atoms with subatomic particles. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
LAWRENCE: We are on the verge of discovering a way to provide cheap,
safe, atomic energy for virtually every kind of use. <br>
QUINN: We're developing a new kind of nuclear reactor, one which
converts nuclear energy directly to electrical power. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's all very well, but what is going wrong? <br>
BRIGADIER: Two things. First, an abnormally high rate of personnel
trouble. Nervous breakdowns. Absenteeism. Accidents. But the really
serious problem, is the power losses. <br>
LAWRENCE: There have been a certain number of unexplained leakages in
the power supplied by the nuclear generator. I am confident we shall
find an explanation. <br>
BRIGADIER: You haven't found one yet, Doctor Lawrence. That's why I'm
here. <br>
QUINN: Well, it's a highly complex piece of machinery. Naturally there
are problems. <br>
DOCTOR: Naturally. <br>
BRIGADIER: Now there are three possible approaches to this problem.
Security. <br>
BAKER: Everything has been double-checked. <br>
BRIGADIER: Then you will triple-check it, Major Baker, under my
supervision, clear? <br>
BAKER: Sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Personnel. This will be dealt with by Miss Shaw. <br>
LIZ: Oh, yes? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes. Finally, the purely scientific angle. Now, the Doctor
here. What is it, Doctor?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: It's the most extraordinary thing. I can't seem to find my
sonic screwdriver anywhere. <br>
LAWRENCE: You're not proposing to dismantle a piece of equipment worth
fifteen million pounds with a screwdriver? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's not worth fifteen million pins if it doesn't work,
is it? <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I suggest you start by just looking round. <br>
QUINN: Yes, let me take you both over the installation. <br>
DOCTOR: Splendid. Come on, Liz. Doctor Quinn, which way do we go? <br>
QUINN: To the left. <br>
DOCTOR: To the left. <br>
(Liz, the Doctor and Quinn leave.) <br>
LAWRENCE: Brigadier, I shall expect to hear from you as soon as you've
anything to report. You'll see that our work is disrupted as little as
possible. <br>
BRIGADIER: Of course, sir. I'll use this room as my HQ if I may. <br>
LAWRENCE: Very well. And, er, I should be grateful if you could hurry
things up, Brigadier. I want this place working normally again. <br>
BRIGADIER: We all do, sir. <br>
(Lawrence leaves. Baker looks outside to make sure that he has gone.) <br>
BAKER: I must say, sir, that I fail to see the necessity for the
involvement of UNIT. <br>
BRIGADIER: How long have these disturbances been going on? <br>
BAKER: Three months. <br>
BRIGADIER: There's your answer. <br>
BAKER: Sir? <br>
BRIGADIER: Something's been happening here which is outside the normal
security pattern, and that is precisely the business of UNIT. <br>
BAKER: Sir. I think I have the solution. <br>
BRIGADIER: Have you? <br>
BAKER: Someone has been carrying out a planned, deliberate programme of
sabotage from the inside.

QUINN: Heart of the cyclotron. Literally so. In fact, we're actually
inside the machine itself. <br>
(On the other side of the glass screens, scientists work near a large
circular device in the wall which is pulsing pink.) <br>
DOCTOR: You have your own nuclear reactor then? <br>
QUINN: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. The cyclotron uses power in enormous
quantities. Would you care to step down?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: What happens if one of these power losses
occurs at a particularly crucial time? <br>
QUINN: So far, we've always managed to stabilise. <br>
LIZ: If you didn't? <br>
QUINN: Well, theoretically <br>
DOCTOR: Your nuclear reactor could turn into a massive atomic bomb. <br>
LIZ: You ought to shut down the place at once. <br>
QUINN: That would be a decision for the Director. <br>
DOCTOR: A decision he might be reluctant to make? <br>
QUINN: Doctor Lawrence has the research programme very much at heart. <br>
(Liz is suddenly slightly dizzy.) <br>
LIZ: Oh. I think I'd better make a start on the personnel files. I
wonder if someone could show me where to go. <br>
QUINN: Oh yes, of course. Mister Roberts, take this young lady across
to Doctor Meredith in the medical wing, will you? <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right, Liz? <br>
LIZ: Yes, yes, I'm fine. <br>
ROBERTS: (a nice trimmed beard) Yes, of course. Come this way, please. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll join you later, Liz. <br>

DOCTOR: No, no, please do. <br>
(Quinn works at a control desk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quite an achievement, building this centre in these caves. <br>
QUINN: Yes, there are miles of them still in their natural state.
Breathtaking. Ever been potholing? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not for a very long time. <br>
QUINN: No, well I'm very keen on it. At least I was, until <br>
DOCTOR: Until what? <br>
QUINN: A couple of our junior technicians went exploring on their day
off. There was an accident, one of them was killed. The other is still
in the sickbay. <br>
DOCTOR: You have your own doctor? <br>
QUINN: No. Doctor Meredith comes in from the local hospital. <br>
DOCTOR: This technician, was he badly hurt? <br>
QUINN: Well, now, I'm not sure. They seem to be hushing it up. <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder why. <br>
QUINN: I beg your pardon? <br>
DOCTOR: I said, I wonder why. Doctor Quinn, these power losses, do they
take any particular pattern? <br>
QUINN: As far as we can see, completely random. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Well, I wonder whether I could possibly check. A fresh
eye, you know. <br>
QUINN: Oh yes, of course. Here's the log. <br>
(The desk phone rings as Quinn hands over a file.) <br>
QUINN: Excuse me a moment. Quinn here. No, no, no, two three six today.
Now get that right. Two three six. Yes, indeed. <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor Quinn? <br>
QUINN: Excuse me. Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: This log seems to be incomplete. <br>
QUINN: Look, I'll ring you back. That log should be kept every day.
(into microphone) Miss Dawson? <br>
DAWSON: Yes, Doctor Quinn? <br>
QUINN: Come down here a moment will you? <br>
(Dawson enters.) <br>
QUINN: What an extraordinary thing. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
QUINN: Miss Dawson, there's a query here. Perhaps you can help. Do you
know who usually keeps this log? <br>
DAWSON: Oh, it used to be Spencer. <br>
QUINN: Ah, well, that explains it. Spencer's the chap who got hurt in
the caves. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Doctor Quinn. I don't think it does explain it. Look. <br>
QUINN: At what? <br>
DOCTOR: There at the bottom of the page, by the string, the binding?
You'll see a tiny shred of paper. Some of those pages have been torn
out. </font></p>

imaginative ailments, one nervous breakdown. <br>

MEREDITH: But of course these things are quite unavoidable. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. Depressing, isn't it. <br>
LIZ: This is Doctor Meredith. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, splendid. Just the chap I wanted to see. Now look, this
patient of yours, Spencer, the one who was injured in the caves. May I
see him? <br>
MEREDITH: I'm sorry, that's quite out of the question. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, really? Why's that? <br>
MEREDITH: Because I won't allow it, that's why. I'm about to have him
moved into hospital. Besides, you have no authority. <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor Meredith, as an associate of UNIT, I think you will find
that I have the authority to do precisely as I please. May I now see
your patient? <br>
MEREDITH: Oh, it seems I have no choice. All right, but I warn you, it
is at your own risk. <br>

Brigadier, that you're missing the most important point. <br>

DOCTOR: That when Baker was attacked, and when I was attacked, the
thing was called off before it could do any real harm. <br>
LIZ: Davis was killed though. <br>

down in that cave. A large and ferocious one, and a smaller, much more
intelligent kind that controls the first, and may not be hostile. <br>

QUINN: That fool Baker wounded one of them. I have to get it back to

DAWSON: Something happened there. Someone was hurt. <br>
QUINN: Squire's Farm? There's a cave opening near there. Perhaps it?
Yes, it must have come up from the cave opening and made its way
straight to the farm. Yes, that's it. That must be it. <br>

open it? <br>

LIZ: Ow! <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter? <br>
LIZ: Why is it so hot? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the Silurians are reptilian, you see. They've presumably
created an environment inside there that suits them. <br>
LIZ: I wonder how many of them there are. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I wish I knew. There's only one way of finding out,
that's to get in there and see. <br>
LIZ: Well, we can't without one of those things it was carrying. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. <br>

turn it loose sometimes and use it as some kind of a watchdog. <br>

been done about the power failures. <br>
MASTERS: We've got to get this sorted out, you know. I'm under very
heavy pressure from the Minister. The future of this centre is very
much in question. <br>

MASTERS: You've made great promises for this project, Charles. Nuclear

LAWRENCE: And we can do it, too. <br>
MASTERS: Millions of pounds have been poured into this place with no

LAWRENCE: But if this research centre is abandoned, all of that money
will be wasted. <br>
MASTERS: It would mean the end of your career, Charles. That's why I'm

MASTERS: And are there? <br>
LAWRENCE: Well, of course not. <br>

there. <br>

LAWRENCE: Didn't the Brigadier put that in his report? <br>
MASTERS: He was a little vague about the precise nature of the menace. <br>

MASTERS: The Doctor is supposed to be brilliant, in his own way. He may
be a little eccentric. <br>

he shows no respect for my authority. <br>

going to get any reinforcements. <br>
BRIGADIER: May I ask why not? <br>
MASTERS: I can't go to the Minister of Defence and request regular Army
support for you on the basis of a wild tale about monsters in caves. <br>
BRIGADIER: Sir, we have overwhelming evidence that there is something
in those caves. <br>
MASTERS: Do you mean saboteurs? <br>
BRIGADIER: I don't know, but the caves are vast. To cover them properly
I must have more men! <br>

DOCTOR: Miss Shaw, I want you to feed uranium into the reactor, all
right? <br>

DOCTOR: (sotto) When I tell you, lower all the rods in at once. <br>
LIZ: (sotto) Doctor, that will <br>
DOCTOR: Liz, I know what I'm doing. Please do as I say. <br>
(Liz goes back into the cyclotron room and the Doctor speaks into the
microphone.) <br>
DOCTOR: All technicians to your usual sectors, please. To your usual
sectors, please. All right, Liz? <br>
LIZ: [OC] Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Lower in number one rod. <br>

SILURIAN JR: Continue to increase the power. <br>
DOCTOR: As you wish. Liz, now! <br>
(The megawatts meter leaps from 1.2 past the end of the red zone. The
disperser goes Bang!) <br>
SILURIAN JR: You have destroyed the disperser! <br>

SILURIAN JR: For how long? <br>
LIZ: A quarter of a century, possibly more. <br>
SCIENTIST: This means nothing to us. We shall return to our base and
wait in hibernation until the radiation has faded. <br>
SILURIAN JR: Kill these humans! <br>
SCIENTIST: No! They will all stay here to die from the radiation. <br>

BRIGADIER: Well, hadn't you better close down the reactor? <br>
DOCTOR: I can't. <br>
BRIGADIER: You were surely bluffing them? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I exaggerated a bit, but I had to push the reactor past
the critical stage or they'd never have believed me. We'd better get
out of here at once. <br>
BRIGADIER: We can't. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
BRIGADIER: They've jammed the lift. There's no way out.

SCIENTIST: The one who remains here will die. <br>
SILURIAN JR: Is sufficient power stored in the hibernation unit? <br>
SCIENTIST: Yes, I have set the controls to revive us in fifty years
from now. <br>

LIZ: The mega-wattage is still rising. <br>

Liz at the back wall. Bang! Flash!) <br>

shall kill you. <br>

eventually.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor! <br>

BRIGADIER: And just what do you think you're doing down here? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm trying to find out how this hibernation unit works. I must
know if we're going to revive them again. <br>
BRIGADIER: Revive them? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, not all at once, you understand. One at a time, so that we
can reason with them. There's a wealth of scientific knowledge down
here, Brigadier, and I can't wait to get started on it.

DOCTOR: No, no. No, it's just a minor technical fault. We'll soon put
that right. <br>
(The Doctor pours a small vial of red liquid into the radiator. He
counts off a few seconds on his watch, Bessie gurgles and the Doctor
traces a path through her workings with his finger until the liquid
dribbles out of the exhaust pipe on cue and she starts up.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you are. That's fixed it. <br>
(Boom, and it isn't Bessie back-firing.) <br>
LIZ: What's that? <br>
(There is an explosion on the moor. Underground, Junior flails around.
More explosions.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Brigadier. He's blown up the Silurian base. <br>
LIZ: He must have had orders from the Ministry. <br>
DOCTOR: And you knew? <br>
LIZ: No! The government were frightened. They just couldn't take the
risk. <br>
DOCTOR: But that's murder. They were intelligent alien beings. A whole
race of them. And he's just wiped them out. <br>
LIZ: I know. <br>
