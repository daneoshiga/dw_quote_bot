DOCTOR: You are going to love it. One, two, three! <br>
DONNA: Lovely! <br>

peshmoni in all of Shan Shen? <br>
DONNA: Er, no thanks. <br>

her own. A young woman in a black and gold robe calls to her.) <br>
FORTUNE TELLER: Tell your fortune, lady. The future predicted. Your
life foretold. <br>

FORTUNE TELLER: Don't you want to know if you're going to be happy? <br>

The most remarkable man. How did you meet him? <br>
DONNA: You're supposed to tell me. <br>
FORTUNE TELLER: I see the future. Tell me the past. When did your lives
cross? <br>
DONNA: It's sort of complicated. I ended up in a spaceship on my
wedding day. Long story. <br>
FORTUNE TELLER: But what led you to that meeting? <br>
DONNA: All sorts of things. But my job, I suppose. It was on Earth,
this planet called Earth, miles away. But I had this job as a temp. I
was a secretary at a place called HC Clements. <br>

DONNA: Oh. Sorry. <br>

Some sort of red spider. Blew up the base underneath the barrier,

HARRIS: We found a body, sir. Over. <br>

ROSE: Well, where is he? <br>
DONNA: They took him away. He's dead. I'm sorry, did you know him? I

And the first thing I'm

tickets. <br>

there's keen eyes up there and they're watching us, and they're not

so bad here. Britain hasn't got that much petrol. But all over Europe,
China, South Africa, they're getting choked by gas. <br>

home world. There's no one left. <br>
DONNA: You're always wearing the same clothes. Why won't you tell me
your name? <br>
ROSE: None of this was meant to happen. There was a man. This wonderful

them all from happening. <br>

ROSE: You knew him. <br>
DONNA: Did I? When? <br>
ROSE: I think you dream about him sometimes. It's a man in a suit.
Tall, thin man. Great hair. Some really great hair. <br>
DONNA: Who are you? <br>
ROSE: I was like you. I used to be you. You've travelled with him,
Donna. You've travelled with the Doctor in a different world. <br>
DONNA: I never met him, and he's dead. <br>
ROSE: He died underneath the Thames on Christmas Eve, but you were
meant to be there. He needed someone to stop him, and that was you. You
made him leave. You saved his life. <br>
(Donna has a memory of the Racnoss Queen, and water bursting into the
tunnels below the Thames.) <br>

DONNA: Stop it. I don't know what you're talking about. Leave me alone!

DONNA: The whole world is stinking. How can anything be worse than
this? <br>
ROSE: Trust me. We need the Doctor more than ever. I've, I've been
pulled across from a different universe because every single universe
is in danger. It's coming, Donna. It's coming from across the stars and
nothing can stop it. <br>
DONNA: What is? <br>
ROSE: The darkness. <br>
DONNA: Well, what do you keep telling me for? What am I supposed to do?
I'm nothing special. I mean, I'm, I'm not. I'm nothing special. I'm a

ROSE: Donna Noble, you're the most important woman in the whole of
creation. <br>
DONNA: Oh, don't. Just don't. I'm tired. I'm so tired. <br>
ROSE: I need you to come with me. <br>
DONNA: Yeah. Well, blonde hair might work on the men, but you ain't
shifting me, lady. <br>
ROSE: That's more like it. <br>
DONNA: I've got plenty more. <br>
ROSE: Then you'll come with me, only when you want to. <br>
DONNA: You'll have a long wait, then. <br>
ROSE: Not really. Just three weeks. Tell me, does your grandfather
still own that telescope? <br>
DONNA: He never lets go of it. <br>
ROSE: Three weeks time. But you've got to be certain. Because when you

Little Sutton Street leading to the Ealing Road, but you turned right
heading towards Griffin's Parade. You need to turn left. That's the
most important thing. You've got to go back, turn left. Have you got
that, Donna? One minute past ten, make yourself turn left, heading for
the Chiswick Highroad. <br>

temporal feedback. This will correspond to local time wherever you
land. <br>
