a small volcanic eruption.) <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, come on, will you? Look! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my word! Come on, Jamie. Into the Tardis, quickly!

them.) <br>
ZOE: Isn't it beautiful? <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
ZOE: The volcanic eruption. It's beautiful! <br>
JAMIE: Beautiful? A great river of molten lava rolling, any minute <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, a minute. Quiet! Oh! Oh dear! <br>
JAMIE: Something wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this sort of thing's happened before. The fluid links
don't seem to be able to take the load. <br>
(Smoke comes out of the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh! <br>
ZOE: Mercury vapour. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
JAMIE: Well, we can't stay here. We'll be buried by that lava. It's
nearly on us. Look! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my word, what a wonderful sight. <br>
ZOE: Fantastic. <br>
JAMIE: Listen, will you two stop gaping at that and get us out of here.
<br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jamie. We're safe in the Tardis. <br>
JAMIE: Are you sure? <br>
DOCTOR: Well <br>
JAMIE: I mean, has the Tardis ever been buried up to its neck in lava
before? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no. <br>
JAMIE: Well, how can you be so sure we're going to be all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Well perhaps the fluid links have cooled down by now. That's a
bit more power. Zoe, can you read off what that meter is registering,
please? <br>
ZOE: Reading nine eight seven point three. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ZOE: Point four. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
ZOE: Five. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no. <br>
ZOE: Six. It's jumped to nine nine one point. No, it's going up by
numerals! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! This darn thing's stuck! Of all the stupid, idiotic! <br>
(The console is smoking again.) <br>
JAMIE: Doctor! The lava's up to the Tardis! <br>
ZOE: It's reached the thousand danger mark, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: If only I could unstick this stupid, idiotic. Oh, there we are.
Oh. <br>
ZOE: Have you done it? <br>
DOCTOR: No, but I've <br>
ZOE: Are we on our way? <br>
DOCTOR: I've stopped the fluid links from vapourising. We shan't
suffocate. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, but if you don't hurry up and get us out of here, we'll be
fried by that lava. <br>
ZOE: Well, isn't there any way we can get away? <br>
DOCTOR: Well there is an emergency unit, but, oh no, I can't possibly
use that. <br>
ZOE: But this is an emergency! <br>
DOCTOR: But it moves the Tardis out of the time space dimension. Out of
reality! <br>
JAMIE: Well, fine. Reality's getting too hot anyway. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I, oh all right. <br>
(The Doctor opens a compartment in the console pedestal and takes out a
small unit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here we are. Now then, which end was? Yes. No, look, I can't
possibly use this. We don't know what will happen. <br>
JAMIE: Look, will you stop your jabbering and get on with it. Look! <br>
(The lava covers the scanner screen, which means it has reached the top
of the Tardis. Jamie pushes the Doctor's hand down, clipping the new
unit into the console controls. It's not the normal dematerialisation
sound, and the light pulsates. Then it goes quiet.) <br>
JAMIE: Ah. There you are. We're all right. What was all the panic all
about? <br>
DOCTOR: Is there any reading on the meter, Zoe? <br>
ZOE: Yes it's. Well, that's funny. There's no reading at all. <br>
DOCTOR: No. None of the meters are registering. Not one. <br>
JAMIE: Ah, but we're safe, aren't we? I mean, we're out of that lava
stuff and we're all right here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, possibly. I'd better get working on the Tardis controls
right away. <br>
ZOE: Doctor, we're not actually in flight, are we? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Why? <br>
ZOE: Well, then presumably we've landed. So why isn't the scanner
showing anything? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, because, well, we're nowhere. It's as simple as that.
I'll be in the power room, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, right. <br>
(The Doctor leaves.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey! What does he mean, we're nowhere? <br>
ZOE: I don't know. I suppose he means that outside the Tardis now is
nothing. Just nothing. <br>
(The scanner is blank.) <br>
JAMIE: Well, I'm away to change, and I suggest you do the same. You
look like a wee McLarty. <br>
ZOE: A what? <br>
JAMIE: A ragamuffin, a. Oh, never mind.

ZOE: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What's happened? <br>
ZOE: Oh, nothing. It's all exactly the same. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh good, good. <br>
ZOE: You're worried by something, Doctor. What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Me? Worried? No. No. It's only the unknown that worries me,
Zoe. <br>
ZOE: But if there's nothing outside the Tardis and we're nowhere, then
what is there to worry about? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. But you see, the emergency unit is limited to a
certain time simply because it's <br>
ZOE: Because it's dangerous to stay where we are for any longer, yes.
But we must be safe at the moment, otherwise the unit wouldn't let us
stay here, would it? <br>
DOCTOR: You're interested in what's outside the Tardis now, aren't you?
<br>
ZOE: Well, curious, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Zoe, listen to me. If we move outside the Tardis, we step into
a dimension about which we know nothing. We should be at the mercy of
the forces outside time and space as we know it. <br>
ZOE: But Doctor, I still think we should go out and see. <br>
DOCTOR: Zoe, we must stay in the Tardis.

the dirty shirt, and is looking at the scanner. There are highland
views and the sound of bagpipes. When Zoe enters, we don't hear the
music any more.) <br>
ZOE: He's still got his head stuck in that <br>
JAMIE: Zoe, do you see that? Do you see where we are? <br>
ZOE: What? <br>
JAMIE: Look on the scanner! It's my home! It's Scotland! <br>
ZOE: Scotland? <br>
JAMIE: Aye! <br>
(The scanner is blank.) <br>
JAMIE: Oh. Oh, it was there. <br>
ZOE: Oh yes?&nbsp;<br>
JAMIE: Now look, I'm not seeing things, you know. It was there, I tell
you. <br>
ZOE: Really? <br>
JAMIE: Aye. The mist must have covered it over. Aye, you get a lot of
mist in the Highlands. <br>
ZOE: So you think we've landed then? <br>
JAMIE: Yes. I mean I couldn't have seen anything, could I? Oh, just a
minute. <br>
ZOE: What? <br>
JAMIE: There's a wee gadget on here somewhere that warns you to go
elsewhere if there's any danger. No, no it's definitely switched off.
We've landed. <br>
ZOE: Well, I think it's more likely that you saw <br>
(Zoe sees a futuristic city on the scanner.) <br>
ZOE: It can't be, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, it's switched off all right. <br>
ZOE: It's the city. My home. Jamie, you did see something, but it
wasn't Scotland. <br>
JAMIE: Of course it was. Look, I know Scotland when I see it. <br>
ZOE: And I know my home city. Anyway, there's your proof. <br>
(The scanner is blank.) <br>
ZOE: But I don't understand. It was there. <br>
JAMIE: Yeah, I know. Scotland. <br>
ZOE: No. It was quite plainly. Oh, anyway, we've both seen something,
so that proves we've landed, doesn't it? <br>
JAMIE: Yes. <br>
ZOE: Well, let's go out and see. <br>
JAMIE: Now not without the Doctor. <br>
ZOE: Oh, all right. <br>
JAMIE: Aye. <br>
(Jamie leaves. The city reappears on the scanner.) <br>
ZOE: It is! Jamie, Doctor, It is my home! Oh, come on! Now which one? <br>
(Zoe finds the door opening switch. It is just white outside.) <br>
ZOE: Oh, come on! <br>

scanner vanishes too.)

DOCTOR: But Jamie, it's not poss. You say you both saw different
things? <br>
JAMIE: No! It was definitely Scotland. Zoe thought she saw something
else, her. home city or something, but no, it was very misty and she
couldnae have seen right. <br>
DOCTOR: So you both saw your homes? <br>

JAMIE: Och, I told her to wait. I'll go and get her. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. Don't you see? Those pictures that you and Zoe saw
on the scanner were put there. Obviously put there to tempt you to go
outside.&nbsp;<br>
JAMIE: But who by? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but there's someone or something out there that
wants us to go out of the Tardis. <br>
JAMIE: You mean some kind of danger? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
(There's a beep and a light flashes on the emergency unit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. That's the first warning. There isn't much more time. <br>
JAMIE: What about Zoe? We can't leave her out there. I'll go and find
her. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Jamie! No! <br>
(Jamie runs through the doors into the whiteness and disappears.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie! <br>

JAMIE: Aye. It's funny out here isn't it? It's not the mist that we
thought it was. It's er <br>
ZOE: Opaque. Nothingness. Just like the Doctor said. <br>
JAMIE: Aye. It doesn't feel right, though. Come on, back to the Tardis.

ZOE: Is that the right way? <br>
JAMIE: Of course it's the right way. Oh. Er, no, it could be. Oh. <br>
ZOE: We're lost, aren't we? <br>
JAMIE: No, I wouldn't say that. We're just er. Well, we er. We just.
You want to know something? <br>
ZOE: What? <br>
JAMIE: I think we're lost. <br>
ZOE: Oh, this isn't a joke, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: No, you're right. The Doctor was saying that those images we saw
in the scanner were put here to tempt us out. <br>
ZOE: Well, if there was somebody trying to tempt us away, where are
they? And who are they? <br>
JAMIE: Aye. Aye, well, let's not be in too much of a hurry to find out,
eh? <br>
ZOE: But what are we going to do? <br>
JAMIE: The Tardis can't be that far away. No. If we stand here and
shout for the Doctor, when he hears us he can guide us back. Doctor? <br>

know where to. <br>

eh? <br>

<br>
DOCTOR: That's all right, Zoe. I don't think you could help it. <br>
ZOE: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think whoever it was that was tempting you outside made
it irresistible. Why, even I gave in when the voice said <br>
ZOE: What voice? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Perhaps there wasn't one. Perhaps it was just
illusion. <br>
ZOE: But we are safe now? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, yes. The Tardis is performing quite normally. Oh,
that's odd. <br>
ZOE: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this meter's dropped below a thousand. <br>
ZOE: Well, is that critical? <br>
DOCTOR: No. It just means that we're using more power than we're
storing, but don't worry. We've got n emergency power booster unit here
somewhere, if I can find the switch. Now. No. Oh dear. It's here
somewhere. <br>

through.) <br>

noses and mouths.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. Oh, I see. I'm supposed to provide the face, am I? Very
well. Now then. Yes. There we are. <br>

JAMIE: But why should I suddenly be different? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. It's a particularly nasty trick on the part of
the person who brought us here. <br>
JAMIE: Brought us here? What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Just a minute. If you really are Jamie, you
should know what's happened. How did you get here? <br>
JAMIE: Well, you know I was telling you about my dream. You know, about
the unicorn. <br>

JAMIE: Well, he was charging straight for me, head down, ready for the

DOCTOR: Off? Where to? Where've you been? <br>
JAMIE: In the fog. I mean, really. Ever since the Tardis broke up. <br>
DOCTOR: It did what? <br>

wandering about here. I heard you calling but I couldn't find you. <br>

wall with a door painted on it. <br>

JAMIE: Not unless you promise to be a good girl. <br>
ZOE: Oh, you. <br>
DOCTOR: Go on, get her out. <br>
JAMIE: All right. <br>

JAMIE: Come on then. Up you come. One, two, three. <br>
ZOE: I thought I was never going to get out of. Well, who are you? <br>
JAMIE: Eh? Don't you start, Zoe. I've had enough from the Doctor. I
tell you I'm me, Jamie! <br>
ZOE: Well, why does he look so different? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'll tell you later. I think it's about time we got out
of this wood. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, this place gives me the creeps. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you go on ahead, Jamie. <br>
(Jamie leaves.) <br>
ZOE: Is that really Jamie? <br>
DOCTOR: Well. Well, yes. <br>
ZOE: But he couldn't just have changed like that, I mean it's
impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think we may be in a place where nothing is impossible.
Come on. <br>
(Time has passed, and they are still wandering amongst the timbers,
getting nowhere.) <br>
ZOE: Oh my feet ache. I'm going to sit down and have a rest. <br>
JAMIE: If only we could see over these trees. Doctor, if you could give
me a leg up, I could shin up one of them. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, good idea. Come along. <br>
(Jamie goes inside a large, apparently hollow, timber.) <br>
DOCTOR: Up you go. Can you manage? <br>
JAMIE: Aye, I think so. It's a bit tricky but I'm nearly there. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a foothold. <br>
JAMIE: Ah! I'm at the top. Doctor. <br>
ZOE: What is it? Can you see something? <br>
JAMIE: I can see all right. Do you know what this tree is? <br>
DOCTOR: No, what? <br>
JAMIE: It's a letter S. The next one's an L, and then an O and a W.
It's a forest of words. <br>
DOCTOR: This must be a world of words. <br>
ZOE: Well, what do the words say? <br>
JAMIE: Slow but sure. In for a penny. <br>
DOCTOR: In for a pound. They're all sayings, proverbs. <br>
JAMIE: Look before you leap. I can't read any more. <br>
ZOE: Well, never mind that. Can you see a way out? <br>
JAMIE: I think so. Yes. Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Down you come. There's a foothold. Can you manage? That's
right. Steady. There. <br>
JAMIE: There we are. It's this way. <br>
(A little way along, they meet Gulliver with his pistol again.) <br>
ZOE: Oh, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. Don't worry, I've met this gentleman before.
He's a traveller like ourselves. <br>
GULLIVER: Sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Delighted to meet you again, sir. Allow me to present my two
companions. This is Zoe, and this is Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: How do you do, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: We're trying to find our way out of this wood. <br>
GULLIVER: This resolution may perhaps appear very bold and dangerous. <br>
ZOE: But we've got to get away. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, haven't you ever tried to escape from this place? <br>
GULLIVER: No. No, I looked upon myself to be fully settled for life. <br>
DOCTOR: These tests, what's the point of them? <br>
GULLIVER: In choosing persons for all employments, they have regards to
great abilities. A course of study is required to qualify any man for
the service of his country. <br>
ZOE: But who's in charge hear? Who's setting all these tests for us? <br>
GULLIVER: The Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the Master again, eh? I suppose this army of robots works
for the Master as well. <br>
GULLIVER: Army? As to their military affairs I knew not what they
meant. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, surely you've seen them. <br>
GULLIVER: I knew not what they meant. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah now, but surely. That's the sound they make. They're coming
back! <br>
ZOE: Well, what do we do? <br>
DOCTOR: We hide in among the trees. Quick! There's a J, there's room
for two! Oh, thank goodness there's a letter C. You, sir, aren't you
going to take cover? <br>
GULLIVER: The best expedient I could think on was to keep guard. <br>
ZOE: Well, whatever you do, don't give us away. <br>
(Zoe, Jamie and the Doctor hide as the tin soldiers approach.) <br>
GULLIVER: I could not forebear smiling, sir. What you told me is
mistaken. There was no army here. <br>

answered the only objections you have raised against me, I now take a

DOCTOR: Where might I find him? <br>
GULLIVER: The Master's palace is no ordinary edifice, but a citadel, a
walled town at the top of a hill or cliff, which is reckoned the
highest in the kingdom. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, now I think I understand. May I ask, sir, where you come
from? Would it not be Nottingham? <br>
GULLIVER: My father had a small estate in Nottingham, sir. I was the
third of five sons. He sent me to Emmanuel College in Cambridge at
fourteen years old, where I applied myself close to my studies,
learning navigation and other parts of the mathematics <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Oh, I'm looking forward to a long talk with you one

GULLIVER: I should like that above all things, but it would not be
proper at this juncture to trouble you with the particulars of my

GULLIVER: Having been condemned by nature and fortune to a restless and
active life, I must take my leave of you. Farewell. <br>

ZOE: Why does he talk in such an extraordinary way? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he can only speak the words that Dean Swift gave him to
say. <br>
ZOE: But that's ridiculous. I mean, there never was such a person as
Gulliver. He's a fictional character. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course he is. Don't you understand? This world that we've
tumbled into is a world of fiction. Unicorns, minotaur, Gulliver's
travels, they're all alive here. <br>

it over. We're staying on and fighting on. <br>
ZOE: But we'll be fighting on in the dark. We don't know where the next
attack will come from. Medusa was bad enough. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, when someone writes about an incident after it's
happened, that is history. <br>
JAMIE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: But when the writing comes first, that's fiction. If we'd have
fallen into the Master's trap, we would have become fiction. <br>

ZOE: What are we going to do? <br>

DOCTOR: Are you looking for us by any chance? We demand an interview

very rewarding. <br>

tackled the various stages of your examination. <br>

MASTER: Well, do you know, when I was first brought here myself, I was
as bewildered as you are. <br>
JAMIE: Well, how long have you been here? <br>
MASTER: I left England in the summer of nineteen twenty six. It was a
very hot day, I remember. I think I must have dozed off over my desk,
and when I awoke. Oh, but that' a long story. Did you ever hear of the
Adventures of Captain Jack Harkaway? <br>
(written by Frank Richards, a pseudonym of Charles Harold St. John
Hamilton.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, I can't say that I. Wait a minute, a serial in a boys'
magazine?&nbsp;<br>
MASTER: The Ensign. <br>
DOCTOR: The Ensign. <br>
MASTER: And for twenty five years, I delivered five thousand words
every week. <br>
DOCTOR: You are a writer. <br>
ZOE: Twenty-five years, five thousand words a week. Well, that's well
over half a million words. <br>
MASTER: Yes, yes. It was probably some kind of record. Anyway, that was
why I was selected to work here. <br>
JAMIE: And you're the one that's in charge of all of this? <br>
MASTER: In one sense, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Or is all this in charge of you? <br>

operation going. <br>

another way out. <br>

MASTER: Oh, I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. Now, where were we? <br>
DOCTOR: You were about to answer my question. Are you a prisoner here? <br>

here. I have everything I could possibly want. <br>

powerhouse. A lifeline, as you might say. <br>
DOCTOR: What is this intelligence you serve, and why was I brought me

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Master has a conversation with the controlling
computer.) <br>
MASTER: The Doctor is expendable. Expendable. He will be destroyed. Oh,
no, no. He's the only person. There's nobody else. I can't go on for
ever. Oh, please, please give me another chance. You have failed. The
Master Brain must be protected against overloading. Robot force will
deal with him. <br>
(Three White Robots appear.) <br>
MASTER: Change robot weapon to destructor beam. <br>
(The Robot's chest units opens to reveal the weapon. Jamie and Zoe hide
behind the globe.) <br>
MASTER: Remove him. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh my goodness. As the White Robots advanced on the Doc.
No, I can't say that. I can't say that. <br>
MASTER: No, Doctor, you can't save yourself this time. Bring him out. <br>
(The White Robots close in on the Doctor. One reaches out for him.
Meanwhile, crouched behind the Master Brain, Jamie and Zoe watch on.)
JAMIE: Zoe, what can we do? We cant fight those brutes. <br>
ZOE: No, Jamie, but the computer, it must control everything here, the
robots included. And the Master said it must be protected against
overloading. <br>
(There are now four White Robots and the Doctor is free of the head
device. ) <br>
MASTER: It is a pity that we have to destroy such an intelligent mind
as yours, Doctor, but you leave us no alternative. Disintegrate. <br>
(As the White Robots charge up their weapons, Zoe goes to a console and
pushes every button. Jamie joins in. On the monitor the unicorn and the
Medusa appear.) <br>
MASTER: Stop them. They will overload the Master Brain. Destroy them!
Destroy! <br>
(The robots are frozen so the Doctor runs to the Master and pulls the
connections from his skull cap. The old man collapses.) <br>
(The White Robots advance.) <br>
JAMIE: Zoe, let's get out of here and. Duck! <br>
(The Robots fire, hitting the computer console which bursts into
flames.) <br>
DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! Oh my goodness. <br>
ZOE: Shouldn't we get out of here? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Come on, Jamie, give me hand with him. <br>
JAMIE: What do you want to bring him for? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't argue, Jamie. Give me hand. <br>
(The robots carry out their last instruction, to destroy, as Jamie and
the Doctor carry the Master out.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Blackness]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JAMIE: I don't see why we had to bring him. He's
the one that's caused all this trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right, sir? <br>
MASTER: I'm not altogether sure where I am. Is this the office of the
Ensign magazine? <br>
DOCTOR: No, you were kidnapped, just like we were. They've been using
your mind. <br>
ZOE: Well, what happens to us now? <br>
DOCTOR: That depends how efficient the White Robots are. Their last
order was to destroy. Let's just hope they're destroying one another. <br>
ZOE: Well, what about the Karkus and Gulliver and all our friends out
there? <br>
DOCTOR: You can't blow up a fictional character, Zoe. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, but what about us though? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to hope that the destruction of the
computer returns us all to reality. And you, my dear sir. <br>
MASTER: Oh, do you mean I'm going home? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so. <br>
ZOE: But surely it could just as well send us into oblivion. <br>
JAMIE: You mean we could vanish forever? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we shall soon know. Hang on! Here it comes. <br>
(The Doctor, Jamie, Zoe and the Master disappear as the sound of
explosions continues. We see the Tardis reassemble itself.) </font>
