<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (England, June, 1925. A servant in a white coat is
strangled in the corridor, while a young woman who looks remarkably
like Nyssa sleeps. Elsewhere in the house, someone has been tied up on
a bed, and an Amazon Indian with a stretched lower lip sits reading a
book. <br>
Next day, at Cranleigh Halt, the station master waves off the Great
Western train and goes back inside. Then the Tardis materialises on the
station platform.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NYSSA: Where are we? <br>
ADRIC: Earth again. <br>
TEGAN: I did say I wanted to stay with the crew for a while. You can
stop trying to get me back to Heathrow. <br>
DOCTOR: I have. <br>
TEGAN: You certainly know how to fly this crate, don't you. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter, old girl? Why this compulsion for planet
Earth? <br>
(He turns the scanner on.) <br>
NYSSA: What is this place? <br>
DOCTOR: A railway station. <br>
TEGAN: Ah, but when? <br>
DOCTOR: Three o'clock, June the 11th, 1925. <br>
TEGAN: I haven't been born yet. <br>
DOCTOR: It's interesting, isn't it. And no jet lag. Shall we go
outside? <br>
NYSSA: You think that wise, considering what we've just done to London?
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that would have happened if we'd been there or not. All
part of Earth's history. <br>
NYSSA: I hope you're right. <br>
TEGAN: Well, I'd like to take a look. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Railway station]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ADRIC: So what is a railway station? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a place where one embarks and disembarks from
compartments on wheels, drawn along these rails by a steam engine.
Rarely on time. <br>
NYSSA: What a very silly activity. <br>
DOCTOR: You think so? As a boy I always wanted to drive one. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A chauffeur is passing the time polishing the
Rolls Royce. He goes to greet the Doctor as he walks through the gate. <br>
TANNER: Good afternoon, sir. I'm Tanner, Lord Cranleigh's chauffeur. <br>
DOCTOR: Lord Cranleigh? <br>
TANNER: Yes, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: We're expected? <br>
TANNER: Oh yes, sir. You are the Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. <br>
NYSSA: May I ask what you're staring at? <br>
TANNER: I'm sorry, miss. <br>
(Tanner opens the passenger door.) <br>
TANNER: Please, sir, if you don't mind. The game's already started. His
lordship won the toss and decided to bat first to give you time to get
here. That train's always slate. <br>
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of his Lordship. <br>
TANNER: Er, yes, sir. But I do think we should hurry. His lordship is a
first class bat, but I'm not quite sure how strong his support is this
year. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, you lot.<br>
(<i>Tanner gives the trousered Nyssa a strange look, then salutes
the Doctor. They all climb into the back of the vintage Rolls Royce
UL6654 and are driven off.) </i></font></p>

across the ground to meet the car as it comes down the lane.) <br>
CHARLES: Ah, there you are, man, good. I'm Cranleigh. Didn't expect
four of you. <br>
(He stares at Nyssa as she steps out of the car.) <br>
CHARLES: Good lord. Er, I'm so sorry. Do forgive me for staring. You
look exactly like my fiancée. It's quite uncanny. <br>
DOCTOR: This is Nyssa. <br>
CHARLES: You must meet her. <br>
DOCTOR: And Adric and Tegan. <br>
(A cry of Howzat! from the match.) <br>
CHARLES: How do you do. Well, you'd better pad up, Doctor. Got your
gear? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, I regret I have none. <br>
CHARLES: No matter, I'll fix you up. We're taking a terrible thrashing.
54 for 8. I made a duck. <br>
(Charles leads the Doctor away, and the others follow.) <br>
CHARLES: Smutty said he'd send a useful bat. <br>
DOCTOR: Smutty? <br>
CHARLES: Smutty Thomas. Oh, don't you call him Smutty at Guys? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, no, as a matter of fact. <br>
CHARLES: Oh, he was Smutty at school. Now, the wicket's very green, the
ball's keeping low. Any good with the ball? <br>
DOCTOR: Not bad. <br>
CHARLES: Good. Medium pace? Slow? <br>
DOCTOR: Fast. <br>
CHARLES: Top hole. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the cricket pavilion]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Another batsman is given out. Cranleigh CC are 56
for 9 and the Doctor has been provided with pads and a bat.) <br>
CHARLES: Good luck, old boy. <br>
(The Doctor takes his position on the wicket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Middle stump! <br>
(He checks the fielding around him and takes his stance, then smashes
the first delivery for four.) <br>
CHARLES: Well played, sir. <br>
(The Doctor continues to smack the ball all around the field. The score
passes 144.) <br>
CHARLES: Splendid! <br>
(Over by the pavilion.) <br>
CHARLES: Mother, may I introduce Tegan and Adric. <br>
LADY C: How do you do? What enchanting names. <br>
CHARLES: And this is Nyssa. <br>
(Lady Cranleigh and her companion stand.) <br>
LADY C: How extraordinary! <br>
CHARLES: Yes, isn't it. <br>
LADY C: Worcestershire. <br>
CHARLES: Apparently not. <br>
LADY C: Nyssa, did you say? <br>
CHARLES: Yes. <br>
LADY C: Forgive me, my dear, but you must be a Worcestershire Talbot. <br>
NYSSA: No, I'm not. <br>
LADY C: Are you quite sure? <br>
NYSSA: Quite sure. <br>
LADY C: Robert? <br>
MUIR: Uncanny. Quite uncanny. <br>
(Everyone say Hi to the splendid <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0914810/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moray Watson</a>.) <br>
LADY C: Two peas in a pod. Positively two peas in a pod. <br>
NYSSA: I beg your pardon? <br>
LADY C: Forgive a pardonably curiosity, my dear, but where are you
from? <br>
NYSSA: The Empire of Traken. <br>
LADY C: Really. <br>
(The Doctor takes a single.) <br>
LADY C: Your Doctor substitute has made your score almost respectable,
Charles. <br>
CHARLES: Perfectly ripping performance. Much better player than Smutty.
<br>
(The batting side are now all out, and the Doctor is bowling. He takes
a long run up and clean bowls the middle stump. Honestly. It's a wide
camera shot and Peter really is that good.) <br>
DOCTOR: Howzat! <br>
TEGAN: Oh, well bowled! <br>
(Nyssa and Adric are baffled by the game. The Doctor bowls out another
batsman.) <br>
WICKET: Howzat! <br>
CHARLES: Well done. <br>
(44 for 7. Oh dear. And another one.) <br>
DOCTOR: Howzat! <br>
(And again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Howzat! <br>
(And again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Howzat! <br>
(The umpire draws stumps. The match is over.) <br>
CHARLES: Ripping performance, old boy. Come over to the house and meet
the mater. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cranleigh Hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The car pulls up outside Buckhurst House, which
could easily have been the inspiration for Agatha Christie's 1925, the
Secret of Chimneys. The Amazon Indian watches them arrive from an
upstairs window, then closes the shutters. <br>
Charles leads the Doctor in from the entrance hall.) <br>
CHARLES: Mother, may I present the Doctor. <br>
LADY C: How do you do? <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do. <br>
LADY C: Doctor who? <br>
CHARLES: I'm sorry, Mother, but he'd like to remain incognito, and I
think we should respect that after what he's done today. <br>
LADY C: Of course. <br>
MUIR: First rate, sir. <br>
CHARLES: Sir Robert Muir, the Chief Constable. <br>
MUIR: A superb innings, worthy of the master. <br>
DOCTOR: The Master? <br>
MUIR: Well, the other doctor. <br>
(The Doctor looks baffled.) <br>
MUIR: W G Grace. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. <br>
LADY C: Are you able to stay for the ball, Doctor? <br>
CHARLES: Yes, you must. I insist now, all of you. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
LADY C: We have one every year in aid of the Hospital for Sick
Children. <br>
TEGAN: It's fancy dress, isn't it? <br>
CHARLES: Yes. <br>
TEGAN: We haven't got any costumes. <br>
MUIR: I was just thinking how charming yours was. <br>
CHARLES: Costumes are no problem. We keep a selection for last minute
guests. I'm sure we can fix you up. Well, Doctor, how would you like to
take a cocktail to your bath? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, certainly a cold drink. <br>
ADRIC: What do you do with a cocktail in a bath? <br>
CHARLES: Drink it, old boy. <br>
(Upstairs, a snarling man struggles against his bonds.) <br>
CHARLES: Ah, Ann, my dear. Come and meet the hero of the day, and. <br>
(Charles puts his arm around a bobbed-hair version of Nyssa.) <br>
DOCTOR: Great Scott. <br>
CHARLES: Ann Talbot, my fiancée, this is Nyssa. <br>
ANN: How do you do? <br>
NYSSA: How do you do? <br>
CHARLES: And this is the Doctor, and Tegan and Adric. <br>
ANN: Worcester. Have you an Uncle Percy? <br>
LADY C: Not a Worcestershire Talbot. <br>
ANN: Then where are you from? <br>
NYSSA: Traken. <br>
ANN: Where's that? <br>
MUIR: Near Esher, isn't it? <br>
ANN: Could there be Talbots near Esher? <br>
LADY C: Not possible. The hunt isn't good enough. <br>
CHARLES: Well, Doctor, what can I offer you? Brewster here can make
absolutely anything quite superbly. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I do have a terrible thirst. Perhaps a lemonade with lots
of ice. <br>
CHARLES: Ann? <br>
ANN: The same as the Doctor, please. <br>
CHARLES: My dear? <br>
TEGAN: A screwdriver, please. <br>
CHARLES: Ah, a screwdriver, Brewster. And? <br>
NYSSA: Thank you. I'll have the same. <br>
(The Doctor coughs.) <br>
CHARLES: Better make that orange juice for the children, Brewster. <br>
BREWSTER: My lord. <br>
CHARLES: Bob, same again? <br>
MUIR: Thank you, Charles. <br>
CHARLES: And a Tom Collins. <br>
(Tegan goes over to a small glass terrarium containing what appears to
be a black orchid.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's very charming of you to make us so welcome. <br>
ANN: Not at all, Doctor. <br>
(The man upstairs has managed to untie himself. <br>
Brewster serves the drinks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
CHARLES: Thank you. Shall we? <br>
ANN: Are you really from Esher? <br>
NYSSA: I don't even know where Esher is. <br>
TEGAN: How beautiful. <br>
LADY C: The black orchid. Yes, it is beautiful. It was found on the
Orinoco by my eldest son, George.<br>
(The portrait on the wall looks more like Charles to me.) <br>
TEGAN: Of course. I thought I recognised the name. George Cranleigh the
botanist, the explorer. <br>
LADY C: But the Brazilian forests took their toll. He never returned
from his last expedition two years ago. <br>
TEGAN: I'm sorry. <br>
LADY C: Ann was engaged to him, but I'm delighted to say that we're
still going to have her in the family. <br>
MUIR: If Charles marries the right girl. <br>
ANN: Nyssa doesn't even know where Esher is. <br>
LADY C: Which shows great taste. I'm sorry, Nyssa. Our curiosity has
been vulgar enough. It's high time we all change. <br>
CHARLES: Yes, well, I'm ready for a bath, so if the ladies will excuse
us, I'll show you to your room, Doctor. Bring your drink. (to Adric)
You too, old boy. <br>
(Upstairs, the Amazonian enters the room and sees the empty bed. Then
he is hit over the head with a poker and his charge leaves.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor holds up a Harlequin costume.) <br>
CHARLES: Well, I must flatter myself. Call that an admirable choice. <br>
DOCTOR: It certainly is. What are you going to wear? <br>
CHARLES: Ah, that's better left as a surprise, I think. Now then, I'd
better attend to that young man. What was his name again? <br>
DOCTOR: Adric. <br>
CHARLES: Scandinavian? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, not quite. He's Alzarian. <br>
CHARLES: I never could remember all those funny Baltic bits. Geography
was never my strong point. My brother stole all the thunder there.
Positive Odin. Till later, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(Charles leaves. The Doctor tries on the harlequin mask, which covers
his entire head.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan's costume is a pink handkerchief skirt and
green bodice. Very like Cicely Mary Barker's Sweet Pea Fairy.) <br>
NYSSA: You know the dances of this period? <br>
TEGAN: Well, I know the Charleston. I learned it for a play when I was
at school. <br>
NYSSA: How's it performed? <br>
TEGAN: I'll show you. <br>
(Tegan demonstrates.) <br>
NYSSA: Is that dancing? <br>
TEGAN: Well, it's not bad. <br>
NYSSA: No, it's just that on Traken our dancing is much more
formalised, and far more complex. <br>
TEGAN: You dance? <br>
NYSSA: It's part of my training. And although I say it myself, I'm
considered quite good. <br>
(There is a knock at the door.) <br>
TEGAN: Come in. <br>
(Ann enters, in a floaty purple dress with sequined blue butterfly
bustier, followed by a maid with a box.) <br>
ANN: My dears, I've had an absolutely ripping idea. <br>
NYSSA: Oh, how lovely. That's lovely. <br>
ANN: My dear, I'm so glad you think so. Look. <br>
(She produces a second, identical dress.) <br>
ANN: There. With the headdress nobody, but nobody, will be able to tell
us apart. Isn't that topping? <br>
NYSSA: Quite topping. <br>
ANN: Just as long as I don't show this. <br>
(Ann moves her left strap to reveal -) <br>
TEGAN: A mole? <br>
ANN: Yes. You haven't got one, have you? <br>
NYSSA: No. <br>
ANN: Good. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor lays out his costume then goes into
his en-suite bathroom and runs the bath. A secret door in the panelling
opens and the mystery man comes in. He turns when the Doctor sings.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: I want to be happy, but I can't be happy, till I make you <br>
(The door slams.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Hello? <br>
(He comes in from the bathroom.) <br>
DOCTOR: Who's that? <br>
(He spots the open wall panel and goes inside. The door slams behind
him and refuses to budge, so he sets off down the secret passageway.
Meanwhile, the mystery man, with swollen hands, re-enters and gathers
up the costume.) </font></p>

a buffet table. Brewster shows Lady Cranleigh the smoked salmon. She is
dressed possibly as Marie Antoinette. Tall white wig, anyway. The
partygoers are bravely ignoring the very strong wind threatening to
blow everything away.) <br>
LADY C: Splendid. <br>
(Other guests are dressed as Henry the Eighth, a Jane Austen period
woman, a Turk, Cavalier lady. Sir Robert is bewigged as possibly Samuel
Pepys and is dancing with Tegan. No idea what Adric is meant to be in
his large collared top. Nyssa's headdress covers the top half of her
face with sequins and has butterfly antennae.) <br>
NYSSA: I rather think this will be fun. I think you have to ask me to
dance. <br>
ADRIC: Why? <br>
NYSSA: Because that's what everybody else is doing. <br>
ADRIC: What, all those people? <br>
NYSSA: Not me, you idiot. Each other. Come on, ask me. <br>
ADRIC: I don't think I could do it. <br>
NYSSA: Yes, you can. Just follow me. Come on. <br>
MUIR: I hope Lord Cranleigh's dancing with the right girl. It's a
little naughty, really. <br>
TEGAN: I think it's a great hoot. <br>
MUIR: A great what? <br>
TEGAN: Hoot. <br>
MUIR: Hoot. Oh yes. <br>
(Lord Cranleigh is in full hunting pink, and dancing with Ann.) <br>
CHARLES: There is one way of not getting you mixed up. <br>
ANN: What's that? <br>
CHARLES: By having every dance with you. <br>
ANN: Foiled again. You're the host. <br>

LADY C: This is Dittar Latoni, an old friend from Brazil. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do? <br>
LATONI: Sir. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid I'm lost. <br>
LADY C: You are indeed. <br>
DOCTOR: I should explain. <br>
LADY C: Please don't. There's no need. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but there is. You see, in my meanderings I've come across
something rather unpleasant. <br>
LADY C: Go on. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a body through there. <br>
LADY C: What! <br>
DOCTOR: A dead man in a cupboard. <br>
LADY C: Oh, really! <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it's true. May I show you? <br>
LADY C: Please do. <br>

access to this area. <br>
DOCTOR: A larger than average priest hole. <br>
LADY C: The Cranleighs of the time were devout and very hospitable. The
priesthood came here from all over the country. <br>
DOCTOR: It's in here. Are you sure you want to look? <br>
LADY C: It's all right, Doctor. I'm made of quite stern stuff. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. <br>
(The Doctor opens the cupboard door.) <br>
LADY C: Poor fellow. How very unpleasant. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know him? <br>
LADY C: Yes, he's one of the servants. Please. <br>
(The Doctor shuts the door again.) <br>
LADY C: I'm very sorry, Doctor, that you've had this dreadful
experience. I wonder, would you be kind enough to help me keep it from
my other guests? I wouldn't want to upset them. <br>
DOCTOR: Well <br>
LADY C: There's no point in involving them, unless the police decide
otherwise. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. <br>
LADY C: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, if you could tell me how to get back to my room, I think
it's about time I got changed. <br>
LADY C: Yes, I'll show you. <br>

ANN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's it, then. <br>
MUIR: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: A completely logical explanation. A duplication of fancy dress.
Someone else must be wearing an identical costume. <br>
ANN: No. <br>
MUIR: But my dear. <br>
ANN: No! <br>
MUIR: Now be reasonable. <br>
ANN: I am being reasonable. <br>
MUIR: What about your own costume? There are two of those. <br>
ANN: My little joke, Sir Robert. I was in charge of the costumes. There
was only one harlequin. That one. <br>

DOCTOR: And only one murderer. Lady Cranleigh, I agreed to keep it from
your guests, but I have the distinct feeling I'm in rather hot water. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, it wouldn't be cricket. <br>
LADY C: Robert. <br>
MUIR: I respect the sentiment, sir, but I have known Miss Talbot all
her life. She has laid a complaint. <br>
LADY C: Ahem. <br>
MUIR: Made an accusation. There's more to this than meets the eye. Is
this the reason that you wish to remain incognito? <br>
DOCTOR: No, of course not. <br>
MUIR: What is your name? <br>
DOCTOR: That's a very difficult question. <br>
MUIR: Have you any means of identification? <br>

MUIR: Fortunate man. Just exactly who are you and what are you doing
here? <br>

MUIR: How can Lady Cranleigh help you? <br>
DOCTOR: There's something terribly wrong here. Lady Cranleigh knows. I
showed her another dead body. <br>
MUIR: What? Madge? <br>
LADY C: I'm afraid like Mister Well, the Doctor has a vivid
imagination. <br>
DOCTOR: I showed you a body in a cupboard up there. You and the Indian.
