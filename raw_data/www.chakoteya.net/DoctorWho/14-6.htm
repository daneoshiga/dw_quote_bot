<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Victorian Music Hall audience have enjoyed
the performance. Cries of bravo! as the curtain falls on the Chinese
magician and his dummy, and assistant. Backstage, he is met by the
owner, an ebullient chap with a large cigar in his hand and a red rose
in his buttonhole.) <br>
JAGO: Mister Chang. Wonderful, wonderful. Words fail me, sir. Words
quite fail me. <br>
CHANG: You are most generous. <br>
JAGO: Have I ever, in my thirty years in the halls, seen such a
dazzling display of lustrous legerdemain? So many feats of superlative,
supernatural skill? The answer must be never, sir. Never. <br>
(Chang displays his ventriloquism.) <br>
SIN: Honourable master is kind to bestow praise on humble Chang's
miserable, unworthy head. <br>
JAGO: Dashed clever, the way you work the little fellow. Wires in the
sleeves, I dare say. But I'll not pry, Mister Chang. The secrets of the
artistes are sacrosanct. <br>
BULLER [OC]: Hey, you! <br>
JAGO: What the deuce? <br>
(The stage doorkeeper is holding back an agitated young man, wearing a
cabbie's licence number 14305.) <br>
BULLER: Where's my Emma? What have you done with her? <br>
JAGO: You've got no right to burst in here. <br>
BULLER: Out of my way! It's him I want. <br>
CHANG: Your Emma? <br>
BULLER: She come in here last night and nobody ain't seen her since. <br>
JAGO: I'll have the fellow ejected. <br>
BULLER: Now I'm asking you, mister, what's happened to her? <br>
JAGO: Call the stage hands, Freddy. <br>
CHANG: It's all right, Mister Jago. Please, come with me. <br>
(Chang leads the young man away.) <br>
JAGO: Courteous coves, these Chinese. I'd have propelled him onto the
pavement with a punt up the posterior. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CHANG: Your wife? <br>
BULLER: Emma Buller. And don't deny she was here, cos I saw her with my
own eyes. <br>
CHANG: Many ladies come to theatre. Why should you think <br>
BULLER: Not round the side door, they don't. Now, look. I was passing
in my cab and I saw her plain, and I know it was you she was calling
on. She's been acting queer ever since you put the 'fluence on her last
week, so don't try coming the innocent, Mister. I want to know where
she is or I'm calling the law. Clear? <br>
(Chang's assistant helps him off with his stage robe.) <br>
CHANG: Your wife came on stage? <br>
BULLER: Last week. Levitated her, you did. She's not been the same
since. It's done something to her reason, I shouldn't wonder. And she
was here last night. <br>
CHANG: Not to see me. <br>
BULLER: Don't come the cod. She's disappeared. Nobody's seen her, not
since she come here last night, so what about it, eh? <br>
CHANG: In my country we have saying. Man who goes too quickly may step
in bear trap. <br>
BULLER: Right, I'm getting the Peelers. <br>

Thames down in the East End, probably near the East India Docks. Leela
steps out dressed in a Victorian boy's outfit.) <br>
LEELA: These clothes are ridiculous. Why must I wear them? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Because you can't go walking around Victorian London in
skins. You'll frighten the horses. <br>
(The Doctor emerges in deerstalker and Argyll cape.) <br>
DOCTOR: Anyway, we don't want to be conspicuous, do we? <br>
(A foghorn sounds. The Doctor looks at an advertising poster for H'sen
Chang's act of magic and mesmerism.) <br>
LEELA: A swamp creature. That was it's attack cry. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, it was a ship on the river. Excellent. It means we can't
be far away. <br>
LEELA: From where? <br>
DOCTOR: From where we're going. <br>
LEELA: Doctor, you make me wear strange clothes, you tell me nothing.
You are trying to annoy me. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm trying to teach you, Leela. Surely you'd like to see how
your ancestors enjoyed themselves? Splendid. That's why I'm taking you
to the theatre. Li H'sen Chang. Hmm, pity. I'd rather hoped we'd catch
Little Tich. Never mind. If we hurry we'll just catch the second house.

JAGO: You'd better get your tail pinned on. Linens up in five minutes.
Casey, have you got the oopizootics coming on? <br>
(An Irishman comes up the ladder from under the stage and staggers
towards him.) <br>
CASEY: Mister Jago, I've seen it. I've seen it again! <br>
JAGO: Be quiet. I told you before. <br>
CASEY: Horrible, horrible it was, Mister Jago. A great skull coming at
me out of the dark. <br>
JAGO: Damme, you don't want to bankrupt me, Casey. Keep your voice
down. Threadbare in Carey Street I'll be if people get the notion
there's anything wrong with this theatre. <br>
CASEY: Chains clanking, nine foot tall. <br>
JAGO: You've been drinking. <br>
CASEY: Not a drop, sir. <br>
JAGO: Well, it's time you started. <br>
(Jago holds out his hip flask. Casey takes a long pull.) <br>
JAGO: Now pull yourself together, man. <br>
CASEY: I ain't never going down that cellar again. There I was, fixing
the trap, when this apparition rose out of the ground in front of me.
Hideous, it was. Hideous. <br>
JAGO: That's enough. <br>
(Jago takes his flask back.) <br>
JAGO: It's your imagination. <br>
CASEY: Never. <br>
JAGO: A cat or something must be trapped down there making noises. Tell
you what I'll do, Casey. I'll come down with you this evening, as soon
as the house is clear, and we'll have a good look round. Now how's
that? <br>
CASEY: It was no cat, Mister Jago. I seen it! <br>
JAGO: Please, Casey, remember, mum's the word. </font></p>

is confronted by Mister Sin the ventriloquist's dummy, wielding a
knife. Meanwhile...) <br>
LEELA: This is a big village. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: What's the name of the tribe here? <br>
DOCTOR: Cockneys. <br>
(They hear a man scream.) <br>
LEELA: The sound of death! <br>
DOCTOR: You stay here. <br>
(He walks on to see a group men struggling with a one on the ground.) <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me, can I help you? <br>
(The men attack him. They are Chinese. Leela runs in to help but is no
real match for their karate or whatever. Then a policeman's whistle
sounds. The Chinese run off, carrying the man. The Doctor trips up the
last one and Leela pounces on him.. The Doctor chases the others. There
is the sound of a steam train.) <br>
QUICK [OC]: Hold you there. <br>
(The Doctor runs back to Leela. The police have arrived.) <br>
QUICK: Now then, what's all this? <br>
LEELA: Touch me and I'll break your arm. <br>
QUICK: Now don't be foolish, miss. <br>
DOCTOR: Good evening. <br>
LEELA: Keep back, Doctor. Blue guards! <br>
DOCTOR: Good evening, Constable. <br>
QUICK: Good evening, sir. You know this young female, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes. We were attacked by this little man and four other
little men. <br>
QUICK: When I got here, sir, he was being strangled with his own
pigtail, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Girlish enthusiasm, officer? <br>
QUICK: You might call it that, sir. I call it making an affray. I must
ask you to come down the station with me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Chang has successfully got a young lady suspended
in mid air between two chairs.) <br>
CHANG: Please to see, ladies and gentlemen, subject now in state of
deep hypnosis. <br>
AUDIENCE: Oh! <br>
(Chang picks up Sin.) <br>
SIN: She asleep. <br>
CHANG: She not asleep, Mister Sin. <br>
SIN: She been slugging type of toddy. <br>
(Laughter.) <br>
CHANG: I will prove young lady not asleep. <br>
(Chang's assistant removes the chair from under the woman's ankles.) <br>
SIN: She's lying on metal bar. <br>
CHANG: Not lying on metal bar. <br>
SIN: I've seen it done before. <br>
CHANG: I will prove young lady not lying on metal bar. <br>
(The assistant carefully removes the chair from under her head. She
hangs in mid air.) <br>
SIN: She's held up by wires. <br>
CHANG: Enough. <br>
SIN: You can't fool me. <br>
CHANG: Silence! <br>
(Chang puts the dummy down on the chair and gets a samurai sword which
he brandishes round it.) <br>
SIN: Don't touch me! Help! Police! Murder! <br>
(Chang waves the sword around the woman.) <br>
CHANG: You see? No wires, Mister Sin. I will now demonstrate art of
levitation raising most beautiful lady high above own topknot. <br>
(The woman rises in the air, and Chang steps forward underneath her.
From the wings, Jago notices blood trickling down Sin's hand.) </font></p>

DOCTOR: Doctor. Leela. <br>
KYLE: Place of residence, sir? <br>
LEELA: We've only just arrived here. <br>
DOCTOR: We're on our way to the theatre, do you see. <br>
KYLE: Your home address will do for the moment, sir. You do have a
permanent address, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: No, Sergeant. We're travellers. <br>
KYLE: I see. Persons of no fixed abode. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. We do have an abode. It's called a Tardis. <br>
KYLE: A Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: But it's not fixed. <br>
KYLE: I can give you and the young lady a fixed abode, sir. Quite
easily. <br>
DOCTOR: Flat footed imbecile. <br>
KYLE: What was that, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: It was nothing complementary. Get on with it, Sergeant. <br>
KYLE: Now look, sir. We've got our hands full here, all these girls
going missing in the manor, so if you'd just oblige us by answering any
questions we'll get on a lot better. And a lot quicker. <br>
DOCTOR: Sergeant, all this is irrelevant. I've come here to lay
evidence. <br>
KYLE: We'll come to that in good time. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll come to that now, Sergeant. We've just prevented a
kidnapping, a robbery or even a murder. My friend here caught one of
the attackers. Let's come to it now, shall we? <br>
KYLE: We've only your word as to what he did, Doctor. <br>
(The Chinaman is sitting very still at a table nearby.) <br>
DOCTOR: Tell him. Tell him. <br>
LEELA: The man they were carrying was dead. He had been stabbed through
the heart! <br>
KYLE: Really, Miss. And how can you be sure of that? <br>
LEELA: I am a warrior of the Sevateem. I know the different sounds of
death. Now put our prisoner to the torture! <br>
KYLE: Well, if that don't take the biscuit. Torture, eh? This isn't the
Dark Ages, you know. <br>
LEELA: Make him talk. <br>
KYLE: He's a Chinese, if you hadn't noticed. We get a lot of those in
here, Limehouse being so close. Him jaw-jaw plenty by and by, eh,
Johnny? I've sent for an interpreter. <br>
DOCTOR: That won't be necessary. I speak Mandarin, Cantonese, all the
dialects. <br>
KYLE: Oh yes? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Ne how ma? Ni chi mao cora (and so on) <br>
KYLE: Yeah, very remarkable, I'm sure, Doctor, but since you're a party
to the case, it isn't proper. <br>

hook.) <br>
WOMAN: It's a floater, all right. You've got it, guv. <br>
(The two policemen pull the body onto the shingle.) <br>
WOMAN: On my oath, you wouldn't want that served with onions. Never

would. </font></p>

clothing.) <br>
KYLE: Good of you to come so prompt, sir. <br>
CHANG: Not at all, Sergeant. I'm always happy to be of service to the
police. What can I do for you this time? <br>
KYLE: A complaint against this man, sir. The lady and gentleman here
swear they saw him, in concert with others not in custody, carrying
what appeared to be a body, sir. <br>
CHANG: Indeed. <br>
KYLE: A European body as I understand them, sir. <br>
CHANG: What happened to the others? <br>
LEELA: They got away. I caught this one. <br>
CHANG: You caught him? Remarkable. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't I know you? <br>
CHANG: I think not. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I've seen you somewhere before. <br>
CHANG: I understand we all look the same. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you Chinese? Yes, that's it. We must have. No, I haven't
been in China for four hundred years. <br>
CHANG: Are you taking this matter seriously, Sergeant? <br>
KYLE: We are, sir. Will you question the man, sir? <br>
CHANG: Very well. <br>
(Chang sits down opposite the prisoner.) <br>
CHANG: Can I have paper and pencil, please, Sergeant? <br>
KYLE: Certainly, sir. <br>

rolls out. The Chinaman reaches across and picks it up, then puts it in
his mouth. The Sergeant returns with a writing pad.) <br>
DOCTOR: Got it! Li H'sen Chang. <br>
CHANG: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The Master of Magic and Mesmerism. Show us a trick. <br>

DOCTOR: Very good. Very good. <br>
KYLE: I think he's dead, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you do it? <br>
CHANG: I did nothing. What are you suggesting. <br>
(The Doctor sniffs the prisoner's hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Scorpion venom. <br>
KYLE: Scorpion venom? <br>
DOCTOR: Highly concentrated scorpion venom. It killed him almost
instantly. <br>
(The Doctor points to a tattoo on the prisoner's hand.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Tong of the Black Scorpion. <br>
KYLE: Don't know that one, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: One of the most dangerous politico-criminal organisations in
the world. Wouldn't you agree, Li H'sen Chang? <br>
CHANG: You seem remarkably well-informed, Doctor. Alas, I know nothing
of these matters. Most regrettable incident. Goodnight, Sergeant. <br>
KYLE: Thank you, sir. <br>
CHANG: I'm sure we shall meet again. <br>
LEELA: Yes. <br>
CHANG: Perhaps under more pleasant circumstances. <br>
KYLE: Well, I don't know what to do about this lot. <br>
DOCTOR: Then I'll tell you what to do, Sergeant. Organise a
post-mortem. I want an analysis of the organs. <br>
KYLE: You want what, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Well naturally I'm going to help. If the Tong of the Black
Scorpion's here in London, you're going to need all the help you can
get. Now cut along and do as I say. Now! <br>

JAGO: I hope those girls go straight home to their digs. <br>
CASEY: Oh, that they will, sir, with all this in the papers. Nine are
missing now, you know. <br>
JAGO: Nine. There was some fellow in here earlier blaming Chang of all
people for some girl's disappearance. <br>
CASEY: Just vanished off the streets, they have. Mostly in this area,
too. What do you think's happened to them, Mister Jago? <br>
JAGO: Nothing good, Casey, nothing good. That's a stone certainty. <br>

bunch. Fanatical followers of an ancient Chinese god called
Weng-Chiang. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. His followers believe that one day he'll come back and
rule the world. <br>
(There are noises nearby.) <br>
LEELA: So what's he like, this Weng-Chiang? <br>

from his mouth and that he killed men with a white light that shone
from his eyes. <br>

LITEFOOT: When I need anyone's help in pathology, I'll ask for it. <br>
DOCTOR: The constable suggested a drowning case. <br>
LITEFOOT: Fished from the river, but he wasn't drowned. <br>
DOCTOR: By the look of those marks, an animal. <br>
LITEFOOT: Exactly what I think, but what kind of animal leaves
mutilations like those? <br>
DOCTOR: Chisel-like incisors. A rodent? <br>
LITEFOOT: Yes, but that's impossible. Look at the size of them. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Have you established the cause of death? <br>
LITEFOOT: Yes, that's another curious thing. All this happened after
death. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>

QUICK: Yes, sir. I'm just taking them for examination. <br>

was a licensed cab driver.) <br>

LITEFOOT: Rat hairs? Do you know what you're saying, man? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I know what I'm saying. <br>
LITEFOOT: But they're nearly three inches long. Hairs on a rat can't be
more than what, quarter of an inch? <br>
DOCTOR: Interesting, isn't it, because I've just remembered something
else about Weng-Chiang. <br>

had been in a queer state all day. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
QUICK: Well, it seems his wife, that's Emma Buller, daughter of the
house, didn't come home last night. Deceased refused to take his cab
out today as a consequence. Deceased then had several drinks and went
round the Palace Theatre. <br>
LITEFOOT: The theatre? <br>

his wife was to be found. Mrs Gusset says he went off making horrible

JAGO: The Sheffield song thrush. Last time she was here, there were
eggs all over the stage. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great
privilege to introduce to you, in his extended season here at the
Palace, the first of two appearances this evening, someone whose
legendary legerdemain has entranced and entertained all the crowned
heads of Europe. Here to baffle and bewilder in his eclectic
extravaganza of efflorescent ectoplasm, that master magician from the

presumably. His assistant runs on with a covered table.) <br>

CHANG: Next trick very simple. <br>
(His assistant hands him a deck of cards.) <br>
CHANG: Will someone pick cards, please? You sir. Catchee. <br>
(Chang throws the pack he has just shuffled up to the Doctor.) <br>
CHANG: Now, sir, please to assist humble Chang by selecting any card.
Ace of diamonds. Please to hold card in air so everyone see. Now, sir,
please to return card to pack, any place. Honourable gentleman please
to hold pack of playing cards between finger and thumb. Chang will now
shoot magic bullet through ace of diamonds without hitting other cards.
Please to keep very still. <br>
(Chang aims the revolver.) <br>
LEELA: Doctor! <br>
(The Doctor slowly brings the pack of cards towards his face. The
audience gasps.) <br>
CHANG: Please to keep very quiet. Chang shoot fifteen peasants learning
this trick. <br>
(Chang fires. There is no apparent bullet hole anywhere.) <br>
CHANG: Now, sir, please look for ace of diamonds. <br>
(The Doctor holds up a card with a hole where the single diamond should
be. Applause.) <br>

the cabinet, and the Doctor walks out and off the stage in full view of

back to the front of the stage then opens it.) <br>

CHANG: I will say nothing. It is time for me to join my forefathers. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, as an accomplice to murder, the police shouldn't hold you
up long. Tell me about Weng-Chiang. Where did he go? <br>
CHANG: Perhaps back to his great palace in the sky. I failed him. He
was displeased with me. <br>
LEELA: His mind is broken. <br>
DOCTOR: Li H'sen, you know he's not a god, don't you. <br>
CHANG: He came like a god. He appeared in a blazing cabinet of fire. I
saw him and helped him. He was tired from his journey. <br>
DOCTOR: Go on. <br>
CHANG: He was ill for many months. I was but a humble peasant, but I
gave him sanctuary while the soldiers searched. I nursed him. <br>
DOCTOR: The cabinet. What happened to the cabinet? <br>
CHANG: Soldiers of T'ung-Chi took it. Ever since, we have searched for
the great cabinet of Weng-Chiang. The god will not be made whole until
it is recovered. <br>

might do for the brutes, though you'd have to shut the sewers off for a
day or two. <br>
LEELA: Look at this, Doctor. This is all that's left of them. <br>
(A small wardrobe of women's clothes.) <br>
JAGO: Of the missing girls? So it was Chang. <br>
DOCTOR: Not Chang. His master, the crazed maniac who organised all
this. <br>
LEELA: Doctor! The machine's gone. <br>
DOCTOR: That means he's going to start up all over again somewhere
else. <br>
LEELA: He could be anywhere. We'll have to look for him. <br>
DOCTOR: With his DNA helixes split open, the more cells he absorbs into
himself, the more deformed he becomes. <br>
LEELA: You mean he is like a waterbag with a hole in the bottom, and
the hole is getting bigger? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
LEELA: What happened to make him like that? <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps because he used the cabinet. A dangerous experiment in
time travel. Now he'll be struggling to keep his metabolism in balance.
<br>
LEELA: And the rats? <br>
DOCTOR: Just an experiment. He had to gauge the strength of the psionic
amplification field. The rats were handy. After that, they were useful
as sewer guards. <br>
(The Doctor and Leela leave.) <br>

DOCTOR: Homunculus. <br>
LEELA: Homunculus. <br>
DOCTOR: It was made in Peking for the Commissioner of the Icelandic
Alliance. It was in the Ice Age, about the year five thousand. <br>
LITEFOOT: Preposterous. <br>
LEELA: Shush. Go on, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: The Peking Homunculus was a toy, a plaything for the
Commissioner's children. It contained a series of magnetic fields
operating on a printed circuit and a small computer. It had one organic
component. The cerebral cortex of a pig. Anyway, something went wrong.
It almost caused World War Six. <br>
LITEFOOT: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, somehow the pig part took over. So Weng-Chiang has brought
the Peking Homunculus back through time. He could have done. It
disappeared completely. It was never found. <br>
LITEFOOT: I say, I may have had a bang on the head but this is a dashed
queer story. Time travel? <br>
DOCTOR: Unsuccessful time travel, Professor. Findicker's discovery of
the double nexus particle sent human science up a technological
cul-de-sac. <br>
LITEFOOT: Are you following this? <br>
LEELA: Not a word. <br>
DOCTOR: This pig thing is still alive. It needs an operator, of course,
but the mental feedback is so intense that somehow the swinish instinct
has become dominant. It hates humanity and it revels in carnage. </font></p>

observation on the theatre and shortly hope to report to you the
whereabouts of the mysterious Weng-Chiang. Your fellow detective H G J.

(The Doctor rummages through the bag and pulls out the disc.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Eureka! Do you know what that is? <br>
LEELA: You ask me so that you can tell me. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. It's a trionic lattice, an integral part of a
time cabinet. It's impossible to open it without it. <br>
LEELA: You mean it's a key. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. He's not only a scientific fool, he's an absent-minded
one. <br>
LEELA: Perhaps he has another eureka. <br>
DOCTOR: No, eureka's Greek for this bath is too hot. There can never be
another one of this combination. <br>
LEELA: That means he's gone to the theatre. Come on. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold it. <br>
LEELA: But Doctor, Professor Litefoot and Mister Jago are our friends!
We must help them. You know what will happen if Weng-Chiang finds them.

DOCTOR: I do. <br>
LEELA: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Look. Litefoot likes a good fire. He's been out of the house a
long time. We can't go just rushing all over London looking for him.
It's much better to wait for Weng-Chiang to come here. <br>
LEELA: Look, we know he already has the cabinet. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but he doesn't have the key. Always stay one step ahead of
your enemies, my girl. <br>
LEELA: You mean, when he finds the key is missing, and that Professor
Litefoot and Mister Jago are keeping watch, he will force them to tell
him where it is. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Coolies are lying on the floor, groaning. The
Doctor picks up an axe.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. <br>
(The girls run for it.) <br>
DOCTOR: This way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[House of the Dragon]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Leela is struggling against her bonds.) <br>
WENG: Whatever it was, there can be no escape for you. Let the talons
of Weng-Chiang shred your flesh! <br>
(Weng pulls the lever and the life-essence starts to be sucked out of
Leela.) <br>
DOCTOR: Greel! <br>
(The Doctor throws an axe into the device. It goes Bang! Weng runs for
the Dragon as the Doctor unties Leela.) <br>
WENG: Kill, Sin! Kill them! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, quick. Get down! Get down! <br>
(Litefoot, Jago, Leela and the Doctor dive behind an altar with a
multi-armed idol on it. Sin fires the energy weapon again and again.
Weng hides behind the Dragon.) <br>
LEELA: I owe you my life, Doctor. Thank you. <br>
JAGO: Time to thank him when we're out of this. <br>
WENG: Doctor, I offer you a proposition. <br>
DOCTOR: Not now, Greel, we're busy. <br>
WENG: I will spare your lives, you and your friends, if you leave now. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's very magnanimous of you, Magnus. <br>
WENG: Then get up and leave. <br>
DOCTOR: What, with your trigger-happy little friend out there? No
thanks. <br>
WENG: I am offering you your lives, you fools! <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) We'd be cut down before we reached the door. <br>
LEELA: (sotto) I think so, too. He has no truth in him. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Let's see. <br>
(The Doctor pops his head up above the altar, and Sin fires.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. We're staying put, Magnus. <br>
WENG: Then you'll die here, all of you. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you might die first, Magnus. You don't sound too well,
and your food supply's half way to Blackheath by now. <br>
WENG: Sin, crack that bench away. <br>
LITEFOOT: If I only had a gun, Doctor. <br>
JAGO: Or a catapult. I was a dab hand with a catapult when I was a
nipper. <br>
LITEFOOT: What is that weapon? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a laser beam. <br>
JAGO: It's a death ray. <br>
(The little table some way in front of the altar falls to pieces.) <br>
LEELA: (sotto) Doctor, they're diminishing our cover. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Push it over. <br>
(As they tip over the altar so the top is towards the Dragon, the
Doctor makes a break to the side where the extraction cabinet is.) <br>
WENG: Hurry, Sin! There is little time left to me. <br>
(Ho and other coolies enter behind the Doctor's companions. Sin laughs
as he kills them all.) <br>
WENG: No, Sin! You fool, stop! Stop! Obey me, Sin. Obey Greel, your
master, I command you. <br>
JAGO: Jiminy, I felt the heat of that one. <br>
(Leela points at a handgun dropped by one of the coolies.) <br>
JAGO: No chance, my dear. <br>
LEELA: He cannot fire at two objects at once. <br>
JAGO: You mean one of us creates a distraction while you go for the
gun? <br>
LEELA: That's right. Me because I'm quicker. <br>
(The laser blasts a hole in the altar.) <br>
LITEFOOT: Another minute or so and we're done. <br>
(The Doctor throws an axe at the Dragon. It sticks between it's 'eyes'.
Jago leaps up.) <br>
JAGO: I say, I say, I say! <br>
(Sin fires and Jago falls. Leela gets the gun and hides behind a side
table.) <br>
JAGO: A funny thing happened to me. Has she got the gun? <br>
(Bang.) <br>
LITEFOOT: Hey! Who are you shooting at? <br>
LEELA: Well, I've never fired one of these before. <br>
(Sin shifts his aim to the side table.) <br>
LITEFOOT: Got them rattled, anyway. <br>
(Greel staggers down the steps from the Dragon.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's no good, Greel. You're finished. <br>
WENG: I can escape you, Doctor, as I escaped my enemies before. <br>
DOCTOR: Greel, listen. If you activate the zigma beam, it'll be certain
death for all of us. <br>
WENG: Lies, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, Greel! Greel, listen! The zigma beam is at full
stretch. If you trigger it again, it'll mean certain collapse. You know
what that means? <br>
WENG: You can't fool me. <br>
DOCTOR: There'll be a huge implosion, Greel, and you'll be at the
centre of it. The zigma experiments were a disaster! <br>
WENG: No, no, the zigma experiment was a success! A brilliant, total
success! <br>
(The Dragon's eyes swivel over to the time cabinet and Weng.) <br>
WENG: Sin, Sin, what are you doing? <br>
(Sin fires the lasers. Weng cowers behind the cabinet.) <br>
WENG: I order you to. No, no, not me. This is mutiny, Sin. <br>
(Leela runs forward and shoots at the Dragon. The laser stops. The
Doctor tackles Weng and pushes him into the extraction cabinet, which
is still switched on, apparently. When the effect fades, the quilted
cloak still stands there.) <br>
LEELA: Is Bent Face dead? <br>
LITEFOOT: Why do you call him Bent Face? <br>
LEELA: Because it is. No, don't. <br>
LITEFOOT: Why not? <br>
(Litefoot touches the cloak, and it sinks to the floor with a crackle.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Cellular collapse. <br>
LITEFOOT: In all my years as a pathologist, I've never seen anything
like it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's hope you never see anything like it again,
Professor. <br>
JAGO: But where was he from? Where did he go? <br>
DOCTOR: He was a foe from the future, Henry. Look out, Leela! <br>
(Sin jumps down from the Dragon onto Leela's back. The Doctor pulls it
off, holds it above his head then throws it onto the floor, hard. Then
he reaches into its back and pulls something out.) <br>
JAGO: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's his fuse, Henry. <br>
(The Doctor breaks it and throws it away, then takes the key out of the
time cabinet.) <br>
LEELA: What are you doing, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm bringing the zigma experiment to an end. <br>
(He puts the key on the floor and stamps on it. It shatters into tiny
crystals.) <br>
CRIER [OC]: Muffins! Get your hot muffins! <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. <br>
CRIER [OC]: Hot muffins! <br>
DOCTOR: It's the muffin man. Come on, I'll buy you some muffins. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Eating the muffins as they walk along a slightly
foggy street. Litefoot's arm is in a sling.) <br>
LITEFOOT: And then, for example, I would say 'one lump or two, Miss
Leela'. To which you would reply, 'one will suffice, thank you'. Now,
do you follow? <br>
LEELA: Supposing I want two? <br>
LITEFOOT: Oh, no, no, no, no. One lump for ladies. <br>
LEELA: Then why do you ask me? <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, Leela. <br>
(They join the Doctor and Jago next to the Tardis. Jago's head has been
bandaged.) <br>
LEELA: Professor Litefoot has been explaining to me about tea. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>
LEELA: It's very complicated. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's not complicated at all. All you. Look, I haven't got
time to stand here discussing tea. Goodbye, Litefoot. <br>
LITEFOOT: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: It's been such fun. Henry. <br>
(Handshakes all round, then the Doctor and Leela enter the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Yes, the important thing is just warming the pot. <br>
LEELA [OC]: What pot? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: The tea pot. <br>
LITEFOOT: What exactly is that contraption? <br>
JAGO: Well, it's his personal transport. Look, Police. <br>
(The Tardis time rotor starts up.) <br>
LITEFOOT: Extraordinary. <br>
JAGO: No doubt Scotland Yard provided it for him. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
LITEFOOT: I don't believe it! <br>
JAGO: I've said it before and I'll say it again. Our policemen are
wonderful. <br>
LITEFOOT: But it's impossible, Henry. Quite impossible. <br>
JAGO: Good trick, eh? I venture the great Li H'sen Chang himself would
have appreciated that. </font> </p>
