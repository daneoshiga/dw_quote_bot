<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A party of explorers pull themselves up a steep
slope with the help of a fixed rope. A woman slips and the man in front
of her pulls her up. They run back to a site where a tent and equipment
are guarded by armed personnel and go over to an open door leading down
underground. A petite woman trooper speaks.) <br>
MITCHELL: Nothing. <br>
(The non-military woman goes over to another man.) <br>
KYLE: How does this thing work? <br>
WALTERS: It focuses on the electrical activity of the body. Er,
heartbeat, things like that. <br>
(An older, moustachioed man comes over.) <br>
SCOTT: But only of mammalian lifeform. Everything else is excluded. <br>
(The detector equipment is switched on.) <br>
WALTERS: Nothing. <br>
SCOTT: Could they be shielded from the scanner in any way? <br>
WALTERS: A lead screen. Some of the newer alloys. <br>
KYLE: There isn't anything like that in the cavern. They're dead,
aren't they? <br>
SCOTT: It does seem likely. <br>
KYLE: Such a pointless waste. <br>
SCOTT: Yeah, well, we'll find out. <br>
KYLE: They can't be far. I radioed immediately I left the cavern. <br>
SCOTT: You've done all you can. Don't upset yourself. Walters, scan
again. Maximum amplification. <br>
WALTERS: Right, sir. <br>
MITCHELL: How many of you were there down there? <br>
KYLE: Eight of us. <br>
MITCHELL: What were you doing? <br>
KYLE: A survey. The particular cave system we were in has just been
discovered. It's proven to be rich in fossils. <br>
SCOTT: Are you all palaeontologists? <br>
KYLE: And geologists. <br>
SCOTT: It doesn't make sense. <br>
WALTERS: Scan complete, sir. Negative. No sign of life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Underground]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (As two sleek figures walk along a cut tunnel with
lights on the walls, a voice is heard.) <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Right, get your gear together. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quarry]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCOTT: We're going down. I realise going down
again must be hard. <br>
KYLE: The caves are uncharted. You'll never find the bodies without my
help. <br>
SCOTT: I'm grateful. Snyder, I want you to stay here with Walters. <br>
(He has a lot of women in his troop.) <br>
SNYDER: Sir. <br>
SCOTT: Walters, I want a constant scan. <br>
WALTERS: Right, sir. <br>
SCOTT: Let me know the instant you see anything, right? <br>
MITCHELL: Troops ready, sir. <br>
SCOTT: Oh, Sergeant Mitchell, do you believe Professor Kyle? <br>
MITCHELL: I think she's telling the truth. As far as she knows it, that
is. <br>
SCOTT: I agree. All right, put the troop on full alert. <br>
MITCHELL: Sir. <br>
SCOTT: Oh, and just in case she is lying, we'll have her up front where
we can see her. <br>
(Lights by the side of their chins illuminate the troops way through
the passages. Tail end charlie thinks he sees something behind him, but
when he turns, nothing is there.) <br>
SNYDER: The party's making good progress. <br>
(An extra light flashes once on the scanner.) <br>
SNYDER: Is that supposed to happen? <br>
WALTERS: What? <br>
SNYDER: It was a sort of flare. It only lasted a second. <br>
WALTERS: Oh, probably nothing. This equipment's ancient. <br>
(Another flash.) <br>
SNYDER: There! <br>
WALTERS: Ghosting. <br>
SNYDER: Shouldn't we tell Lieutenant Scott? <br>
WALTERS: It isn't worth it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor knocks on the door and enters. Adric
is lying on his bed, reading.) <br>
DOCTOR: You must read this, Adric. The Black Orchid. <br>
ADRIC: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: It's fascinating. Such scholarship. <br>
ADRIC: Why should that interest me? <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter? <br>
ADRIC: I'm fed up. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
ADRIC: I'm tired of being considered a joke. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no one thinks that. <br>
ADRIC: Then why am I constantly teased? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, everyone's teased from time to time. <br>
ADRIC: Yeah, but not as often as me. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not true. <br>
ADRIC: No, and I suppose neither is the fact that whenever Nyssa or
Tegan ask you a question you always find time to answer it, but hardly
ever with me. Oh look, Doctor, how am I to learn if you never find time
to explain? <br>
(The Doctor looks up from the Kinda necklace he is examining.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time? We have spent many hours discussing and debating endless
topics. <br>
ADRIC: I'm just fitted in when it's convenient for you. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, I'll make more time. <br>
ADRIC: No, you've said that too often before, Doctor. There will always
be some distraction to prevent it happening. <br>
DOCTOR: I give you my word. <br>
ADRIC: Just as you gave your word to Tegan. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not fair. <br>
ADRIC: No, it never is when you're being criticised, is it. Just as
it's never your fault when something goes wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you quite finished? <br>
ADRIC: There's lots more! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it can wait! <br>
ADRIC: Yes, but I can't. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside Adric's room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ADRIC: I'm tired of being an outsider, Doctor. I
want to go back to my own people. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Underground]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Scott helps Kyle out of a narrow crawlspace into
an stream.) <br>
SCOTT: Is this the only way down? <br>
KYLE: The only known way. <br>
SCOTT: You must have had some fun getting the gear through there. <br>
KYLE: The expedition was cursed from the beginning. <br>
SCOTT: Oh? <br>
KYLE: We had endless problems. Even lighting the tunnels was a
nightmare. <br>
MITCHELL: In what way? <br>
KYLE: All sorts of things. Annoying things. The tools would go missing.
Small but important components would be discovered smashed. <br>
SCOTT: Sabotage? <br>
KYLE: I didn't think so at the time. Someone wanting to wreck the
expedition could have been far more positive about it. <br>
SCOTT: As ultimately they were. <br>
(Two figures watch them go.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Nyssa sets a control on the console.) <br>
NYSSA: There. <br>
TEGAN: I'll never learn how to do that properly. <br>
NYSSA: It isn't difficult. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: No, Adric, I will not do it! <br>
ADRIC [OC]: You've done it before! <br>
(The Doctor storms in. Adric stays just outside the console room.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis is not designed for E-space! Nyssa, tell him! <br>
NYSSA: Tell him what? <br>
DOCTOR: He wants to go home! <br>
NYSSA: To Alzarius? <br>
ADRIC: No, to Terradon. <br>
DOCTOR: And that would involve the Tardis going back into E-space. <br>
NYSSA: The Doctor's right. It would be very dangerous. <br>
ADRIC: I could plot a course. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you calculate negative coordinates? <br>
ADRIC: I have the mathematical skill. <br>
DOCTOR: It would also involve passing through the CVE. Now, you can't
calculate random coordinates. <br>
ADRIC: The Monitor on Logopolis indicated they were not random. <br>
DOCTOR: You do not have the Monitor's skill, Adric, and even if you
did, I am not going back into E-space! <br>
ADRIC: Then I will find someone who will take me! <br>
DOCTOR: E-space is another universe. There isn't a taxi service goes
back and forth. <br>
(Adric walks into the console room.) <br>
ADRIC: Once I've calculated the course, the journey itself would be
simple. <br>
NYSSA: It won't. <br>
ADRIC: Romana's still in E-space. Once I get there, she can help me. <br>
TEGAN: Is it really that dangerous? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you really think I'd be making all this fuss if it weren't? <br>
ADRIC: Can I use your computer? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, help yourself. I'm not waiting around while you plot the
course to your own destruction. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Underground]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCOTT: How much further? <br>
(There is a sound and a small rockfall. One of the troopers is hit.) <br>
SCOTT: What caused that? <br>
KYLE: I don't know. They've never done it before. <br>
MITCHELL: Trooper Bane's hurt, sir. <br>
BANE: I've damaged my shoulder. <br>
MITCHELL: Nothing broken. <br>
SCOTT: Can you walk? <br>
BANE: I think so. <br>
SCOTT: Good. <br>
(Scott uses his communicator.) <br>
WALTERS [OC]: Walters. <br>
SCOTT: Bane's had an accident. I'm sending her up. <br>
WALTERS [OC]: Right, sir. <br>
SCOTT: She'll need medical treatment <br>
(The sound starts again.) <br>
SCOTT: What's that? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Quarry]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WALTERS: I don't know, sir. It's causing the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SCOTT: See if you can trace it, will you? <br>
(The sound stops.) <br>
SCOTT: Too late. <br>
KYLE: I've heard that noise before. <br>
SCOTT: When? <br>
KYLE: A few minutes before we were attacked. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises, the scanner comes on and
the Doctor briefly hides his face in his hands.) <br>
NYSSA: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Earth. <br>
NYSSA: Oh, not again. <br>
DOCTOR: Twenty sixth century. <br>
ADRIC: The year is 2526 in the time scale you call Anno Domini. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
TEGAN: Why have we materialised underground? <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? Adric wants to use the computer, I want to go for a
walk. <br>
NYSSA: Why not help Adric? <br>
ADRIC: I don't need his help, thank you very much. <br>
DOCTOR: You see? <br>
NYSSA: Please, Doctor, it's gone far enough. <br>
ADRIC: Do you know, I think since his regeneration, he's become
decidedly immature. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm going outside now. I might be gone some time. <br>
(The Doctor opens the door and leaves.) <br>
TEGAN: I'm going to talk some sense into the Doctor. <br>
(Tegan follows him out.) <br>
NYSSA: Oh dear, it's all getting rather silly, isn't it. <br>
ADRIC: Oh, I didn't mean to be so rude. <br>
NYSSA: Look, why don't you calculate the course home? Show the Doctor
it can be done. Then when he's calmed down, we can all talk to him. <br>
ADRIC: But will he listen? <br>
NYSSA: Of course he will. <br>
(Nyssa goes outside. Meanwhile, Troopers Collis and Bane are crawling
through the narrow space.) </font></p>

SNYDER: Where have they come from? <br>
WALTERS: I don't know. <br>
(Snyder beeps the communicator.) <br>
SCOTT [OC]: Scott. <br>
SNYDER: We have three unidentified lifeforms on the scanner. <br>
WALTERS: One of the readings is ectopic, sir. <br>
SCOTT [OC]: What does that mean? <br>
WALTERS: That one of the lifeforms has two hearts. </font></p>

DOCTOR: So peaceful and cool down here. <br>
TEGAN: Breathe deeply and relax. Now, go and make it up with Adric,
please? <br>
DOCTOR: All right, but I'm not taking him back into E-space, and that's
my final word on the matter. <br>
NYSSA: Look at his calculations before you decide. It may be possible. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, I'll look, but I'm not promising anything. <br>
NYSSA: Of course not, Doctor. </font></p>

NYSSA: What are you talking about? <br>
TEGAN: Well, it should be totally dark, but we can see. <br>
DOCTOR: Phosphorescence. <br>
NYSSA: And something else. <br>

NYSSA: Lots of bones. <br>

TEGAN: Dinosaurs. <br>
DOCTOR: An amazing species. <br>
NYSSA: Are they your ancestors? <br>
TEGAN: I hope not! <br>
DOCTOR: You should be proud if they were. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, thank you very much. Most of them had a brain the size of a
pea. <br>
DOCTOR: They were also the most successful creature ever to inhabit the
Earth. <br>
NYSSA: In what way? <br>
DOCTOR: Fossilised remains have been found all over the planet. Not bad
adaptation for a creature with a brain the size of a pea. <br>
NYSSA: How long did they exist? <br>
DOCTOR: Hundred million years or so. They seemed so secure and yet they
died out virtually overnight. </font></p>

NYSSA: How could such a successful species die out so quickly? <br>
DOCTOR: Initially hypothermia, then starvation. <br>
NYSSA: Caused by what, an ice age? <br>

something from space. <br>

TEGAN: But how could one asteroid wipe out all the dinosaurs? It just
isn't possible. <br>
NYSSA: You're forgetting displacement. <br>
DOCTOR: The impact would have caused millions upon millions of tons of
earth and rock to be fragmented and then hurled up into the atmosphere,
enveloping the whole planet. <br>
NYSSA: The storm it created must have lasted for months. <br>

dropped radically. <br>

it has to be contained in a vessel with a totally stable molecular

normally. <br>
BRIGGS: We're to stay on board? <br>
LEADER: Yes. Although your presence isn't needed, of course. The
