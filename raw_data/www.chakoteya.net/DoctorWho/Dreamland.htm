firing on it. When they hit it and it tumbles towards a planet, they
veer off. It crashes in the New Mexico Desert on June 13, 1947, thirty
five miles from Roswell, just off Interstate 25.)

is pouring a cup of coffee for the young man sitting at the counter,
and the Everly Brothers 'Dream' is playing on the jukebox when a man in
a slightly tight suit enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Howdy there, pardners. <br>
JIMMY: Howdy. <br>
CASSIE: How you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, the smell of fast food on the desert air. The perfume of
America. <br>
CASSIE: Hey, are you British or something? <br>
DOCTOR: Something, that's me, definitely. I was passing and I got the
fancies. A bowl of chili. The sort you only ever got in an American
diner before 1962. I'm the Doctor, by the way. <br>
CASSIE: I'm Cassie. This is Jimmy Stalkingwolf. <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa, where did you get that? <br>
(In a case on the counter is a green coil with metal ends.) <br>
CASSIE: It's supposed to be from the saucer that crashed five years
back. You know, like that Roswell thing over in New Mexico. My mom, she
used to run this place, thought it would bring in the tourists. <br>
(The Doctor has taken the coil out of its box. He zaps it with his
sonic screwdriver.) <br>
CASSIE: Like they don't know a piece of junk when they see it.) <br>
(The coil lights up and the light bulbs in the ceiling blow.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo. Sorry. <br>
JIMMY: What did you just do, man? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid this isn't quite a piece of junk. <br>
(A car stops outside.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Two men in black are in it. The blond one looks at
a device he is holding.) <br>
DREAD: It has been activated.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sammy's Pitstop]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CASSIE: Are you saying this really did come from a
flying saucer? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a flying saucer, maybe. They were quite fashionable in
the fifties. Bit like bobbie sox and haircream. <br>
JIMMY: I told you. I told you there was something going on round here. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
CASSIE: Jimmy works out at the Broken K ranch. Says there's this space
monster eating the cattle. I told him it's a cougar. <br>
JIMMY: No cougar did what I saw, or left those tracks. <br>
(One of the men in black enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, hello. <br>
DREAD: I'll take the ionic fusion bar. <br>
CASSIE: Come again? <br>
DOCTOR: He means your piece of junk. <br>
CASSIE: No way! It doesn't belong to you. <br>
DOCTOR: Not such a good idea to argue. Hello, I'm the Doctor. <br>
DREAD: Give it to me. <br>
JIMMY: Didn't you hear what the lady said? <br>
(Jimmy puts his hand on the man's shoulder.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's definitely not a good idea. <br>
(One gentle shove sends Jimmy flying backwards down the length of the
diner.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, time to go. <br>
(The Doctor sonicks the radio as they run out. It sparks and glows,
making the man cower. They all drive off in Jimmy's pickup truck.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(They are by a very large footprint in the sand.) <br>
JIMMY: What kind of cougar makes a print like that? <br>
DOCTOR: No cougar. <br>
(Cassie and Jimmy turn to look at what is suddenly covering them with
its shadow. The Doctor is oblivious.) <br>
DOCTOR: No animal. This was something big. Very big. Something
powerful. Something that isn't from around here. <br>
(Like the big green red-eyed being towering over them. It roars.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Viperox battle drone. Hello! <br>
(Cassie screams.) <br>
DOCTOR: Try not to do that. Apart from being one of the most vicious
killers in the cosmos, Viperox have very sensitive ears. <br>
(Jimmy puts his hand over Cassie's mouth.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Not a good idea to aggravate him. <br>
JIMMY: It doesn't look aggravated to me, Doc. He looks hungry. <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor, not Doc, and if he was hungry he'd be picking bits of
cowboy boots and bobbie sox off his mandibles by now. <br>
CASSIE: So if he ain't going to eat us, what is he going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a Viperox battle drone. What it doesn't use for food it
uses for target practice. <br>
(The Viperox raises its very long 'arms' and opens its claws. There are
harpoons inside them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look out! <br>
(A harpoon flies over their heads and explodes in the distance.) <br>
DOCTOR: Run! Back to the pickup! <br>
(A helicopter arrives overhead.) <br>
DOCTOR: Get down! <br>
(As they hit the ground, a missile from the helicopter makes the
Viperox go Splat! A claw lands in the ground close to them. The
helicopter lands and they dust themselves off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Howdy! Perfect timing. <br>
SOLDIER: Our orders are to take you with us. <br>
DOCTOR: Whose orders are those, then? <br>
SOLDIER 2: Colonel Stark, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Colonel Stark! Who's that, then. <br>
SOLDIER 2: Commanding Officer, Operation Fallen Angel, Groom Lake Army
Airbase. <br>
DOCTOR: What? You mean Area 51. Dreamland? Oh, I've always wanted to go
there. <br>
CASSIE: Doctor, no. People that go there, civilians, they never come
back. <br>
JIMMY: I've heard all kinds of things about that place, and none of
it's good. It's said they've got aliens there from the Roswell crash. <br>
DOCTOR: I know. I've always wanted to take a peek. Take me to your
leader. Allons-y.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR [OC]: Dreamland. The United State's most
secret base. It doesn't appear on any map, and the government won't
admit it exists till 1994. <br>
JIMMY [OC]: What did you say? <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Er, never mind.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CASSIE: Where are they taking us? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I don't think Colonel Stark has a penthouse
apartment. <br>
(They go down.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Secure room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(With a submarine style door, two filing cabinets,
two chairs and a table.) <br>
JIMMY: So what happens now? <br>
CASSIE: Nothing good. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. I thought the fifties were supposed to be a time
for optimism. I mean, you thing you're going to have flying cars in
another ten years. <br>
CASSIE: Yeah, sure, if the Reds don't nuke us first. <br>
DOCTOR: The Reds? Manchester United? Oh, the Russians. Soviet Union. I
wouldn't worry about them. They're as scared of a nuclear war as you
are. <br>
(The door opens.) <br>
STARK: I hear you people had some trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Colonel Stark, I presume. Hello, I'm the Doctor, (sotto)
and I think you may have a serious infestation problem. <br>
STARK: We have the situation in hand. <br>
CASSIE: So what are you going to do about it? <br>
STARK: You don't have to worry, ma'am. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? Why's that? <br>
STARK: Because you're going to forget everything you've seen. You're
going to forget everything. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Colonel. Colonel, you're making a mistake. <br>
STARK: Soldiers! Take them to the lab. Prepare them for the mind wipe.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Mind wipe lab]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A large place. The Doctor, Jimmy and Cassie are
fastened to three tables tilted slightly backwards.) <br>
CASSIE: What are they going to do to us? <br>
DOCTOR: From the look of this chamber, use some sort of amnesia gas. <br>
JIMMY: So we forget everything about that Viperox bug thing? Maybe that
isn't so bad. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Trouble is, no one really perfects a targeted amnesia drug
for another fifty years. The sort of thing Colonel Stark has in his
medicine cabinet won't just wipe out the last few hours. You'll forget
everything. <br>
CASSIE: They can't do this. We're US citizens. <br>
JIMMY: Yeah, Cassie, and they're the Army. They can do whatever they
want. They've been doing it ever since the Bear River massacre. <br>
(Stark enters.) <br>
DOCTOR: Colonel. Sorry I can't salute, but I seem to be strapped to a
table. <br>
STARK: The gas can have side-effects. The straps are for your own
safety. <br>
DOCTOR: Very thoughtful, but have you considered that you've got
dangerous ten foot tall aliens out in the desert? And believe me,
Colonel, where there's one Viperox there's at least a thousand more. <br>
STARK: You know a great deal, Doctor. More than is good for you. But
I'm going to fix that. <br>
(The Colonel turns a red wheel and green gas starts to enter the room.)
<br>
CASSIE: You can't do this. So help me, I'm going to tell the President.
<br>
STARK: Little lady, in ten minutes you won't know who the President is.
You won't know who you are. <br>
(Stark leaves, closing the door behind him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Try to hold your breath. I just need a few more seconds. <br>
(A big screen in front of them shows a hypnotic image. The Doctor gets
one arm free.) <br>
JIMMY: How did you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Little trick I learned off Houdini. <br>
(He frees himself and shuts off the gas.) <br>
CASSIE: Great, but we're still trapped. <br>
(The Doctor points to a grille in the ceiling.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ventilation shaft]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: There's always a ventilation shaft. <br>
CASSIE: Doctor, are you sure there's a way out of here? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course there's a way out. There always is. Apart from in
Star Wars, of course. <br>
JIMMY: Hey, Doc, are you ever going to start making sense? <br>
DOCTOR: Are you going to stop calling me Doc? I'm the Doctor, all
right? And you're not Bugs Bunny. <br>
JIMMY: Hey. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor punches out a grill in the base of the
shaft and drops down. Cassie follows.) <br>
CASSIE: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Who am I, the Dreamland tour guide? Come on. <br>
JIMMY: Why are we going that way? I mean, who gave you the stripes?
You're not even American. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, come to that, I'm not even human. <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
DOCTOR: But someone's just noticed we've escaped, so whichever way
you're running, I'd start now. <br>
(They follow the Doctor to a junction. Armed soldiers are approaching.)
<br>
CASSIE: What now? <br>
(The Doctor spots a sign - Lab 51.) <br>
DOCTOR: That way. <br>
JIMMY: There's no way through here. <br>
(The Doctor sonicks the lock on the door to Level 24B.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
(The soldiers run past.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(One wall has a big metal door on it, labelled
Warning Biohazard. A movie camera is pointing at it.) <br>
CASSIE: Did you mean what you said back there, you're not human? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, human, Time Lord, it's all just an accident of
dimensional geography when you get down to it. I wonder what's behind
there? <br>
(He pushes the button that raises the metal door. A small grey alien is
sitting on the bed in
an otherwise empty cell. It raises its large head and blinks its big
black eyes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
JIMMY: Uh, now that is an alien. <br>
DOCTOR: The question is, why are they keeping her a prisoner? <br>
(Soldiers burst in. The Doctor sonicks some computer equipment which
shatters, injuring the soldiers.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quickly, this way. <br>
(Into the elevator.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on. <br>
(He sonicks the controls and up they go.)

AZLOK: You have a problem, Colonel? <br>
STARK: Nothing we can't handle. <br>
AZLOK: I warn you, Colonel, Fail me, and your world will pay the price.
<br>
(The Colonel speaks into his walkie-talkie.) <br>
STARK: Don't let them get away again. And you, keep your soldiers off
the plains, Lord Azlok. I don't need this getting any more complicated.
<br>
AZLOK: Viperox are not accustomed to taking orders from lesser species,
Colonel, or to their mistakes. See to it that you do not let us down. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Hangar]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Our trio are walking towards an alien spacecraft.)
<br>
JIMMY: I cannot be seeing that. <br>
CASSIE: A real live flying saucer. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Fancy taking her for a spin? <br>
(The Doctor sonicks the ship and the entry ramp drops down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, come on! <br>
SOLDIER: Stop, or we fire! <br>
SOLDIER 2: Don't shoot, you'll hit the ship. <br>
(The Doctor, Jimmy and Cassie get aboard, the ramp closes up and) <br>
SOLDER 2: Fall back! Fall back! <br>
(The spaceship takes off, smashing its way out of the hangar and up
into the sky.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is at the controls, and the flight is
not exactly smooth.) <br>
CASSIE: Can you really fly this? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, sort of. Ooff. Stark's scientists have retro-engineered
it, probably based on their prisoner's ship. They've got a couple of
systems the wrong way round, but we're getting there. Ha, ha, ha! Left
is right and up is down. No problem, no problem. <br>
(Then sparks fly.) <br>
JIMMY: What did you do that time? <br>
DOCTOR: Wasn't me. <br>
(The US Air force is shooting at them.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've got company. Hang on! <br>
CASSIE: Those red lights don't look good. <br>
DOCTOR: Red lights never are. I wonder if parachutes came as standard
or an added option. <br>
(Smoke trailing from the engines, they crash into the desert.) <br>

an oil lamp.) <br>
CASSIE: Nice place, Jimmy. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you got a match? <br>
JIMMY: Sure. Here. <br>
(They light the lamp.) <br>
CASSIE: Look, what's going on, Doctor? If the military know about these
alien things, how come we're the enemy? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I intend to find out. Tomorrow I'm going back
to Dreamland. <br>
JIMMY: What was that? <br>
(He goes into a room with a hole in the floorboards, and gets grabbed
by a Viperox.) <br>

back in Solitude.

(A third Viperox walks up to them.) <br>
AZLOK: Be careful, human. I am Azlok, Lord Might of the Imperial
Viperox Warhorde. Consider who seems in more danger of being crushed
underfoot. <br>
JIMMY: You're never going to take over Earth. The military will blast
you into bug bits. <br>
AZLOK: What do you think the Empire of the Viperox would possibly want
with this

(The Doctor is listening.) <br>
AZLOK: Who is this man called Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, now, that would be me. <br>
(Cassie sneaks behind the Viperox towards Jimmy.) <br>
AZLOK: Ah, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I've got a few things I'd like to ask you, as it happens. The
most obvious being, if you're not here to invade it, what on Earth are
you doing here? <br>
(Cassie pulls pieces off the carapace off, to free Jimmy.) <br>
AZLOK: You are not of this world. I hear two hearts beating. <br>
DOCTOR: Then note their rhythm. I'm not scared of you. And whatever
you're doing on Earth, I won't let you hurt its people. <br>
AZLOK: We seek only an enemy of our kind. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? And who's that, then? <br>
CASSIE: Doctor, look out! <br>

flames encircle the Viperox.)

ground.) <br>

collection of pyramidical pods.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, this isn't good. <br>

underground, and hatch one. <br>

DOCTOR: The Viperox Queen. <br>

block of wood from the wagon wheels then leaps aboard as it heads off
down the slope.) <br>

DOCTOR: Hello again. I don't think we got properly introduced back at
the diner. You are? <br>
DREAD: Mister Dread. These are my associates. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, let me guess. Mister Fear, Mister Terror and Mister
Apprehension. The Alliance of Shades' mop up teams never were all that
good at mingling. <br>
CASSIE: You know these guys? <br>
DOCTOR: Sort of. The US government aren't the only people that want to
keep a lid on aliens. A lot of planets think you're too primitive. <br>
JIMMY: Primitive? We have nuclear missiles. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, primitive and aggressive. No offence. <br>
CASSIE: None taken. <br>
DOCTOR: Anyway, if the Alliance get reports of a spaceship crashing or
some showoff sort of pilot doing loop the loops over the White House,
they send in these guys to dispose of the evidence. And sometimes the
eye witnesses. Only they're not very good. <br>
DREAD: Where is the ionic fusion bar? <br>
DOCTOR: Huh? Oh, the gizmo from the crashed spacecraft? Sorry, lost
that while we were being attacked by a Viperox battle drone. <br>

DOCTOR: Didn't I mention? They're robots. <br>
(All the MiB are aiming weapons at them.) <br>
DREAD: Give it to me. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you think the Alliance of Shades would be more interested
in a thousand Viperox battle drones ready to hatch under our feet than
in a piece of space flight hardware? <br>
DREAD: Tell me where the ionic fusion bar is, and we will deal with the
Viperox. <br>
DOCTOR: What! You couldn't even keep a lid on flying saucers. You know,
in 1972, the Alliance pulls the plug on the lot of you. How are you
four going to hold back Lord Azlok and his Viperox hordes? Unless <br>
(Dread tumbles forward, with an arrow in his back. The other robots do
the same.) <br>
JIMMY: Grandpa! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I could have found out everything then. Why does that keep
happening today? <br>
JIMMY: Doctor, Cassie, this is my grandpa, Night Eagle. <br>
CASSIE: Hey, that was kind of handy with those bows and arrows. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, straight through the central processing unit. One lucky
shot I could believe, but four? You've met men like this before,
haven't you, Night Eagle. <br>

come. <br>

CASSIE: So the ionic fusion thing came from his ship? <br>
JIMMY: How could you keep this secret? <br>
NIGHT EAGLE: Others searched for him. Men in black suits. Those who
knew swore to tell no one, not even our blood kin, to keep him safe. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, I'm the Doctor. I can help you. <br>
RIVESH: I want to go home. <br>
DOCTOR: I can take you home. <br>
RIVESH: Not without Seruba Velak. <br>
JIMMY: Who? <br>
CASSIE: The other grey alien back at Dreamland. Keep up, Jimmy. <br>
DOCTOR: But she wasn't on your ship, was she. Night Eagle and his men
would have saved her, too. <br>
RIVESH: No. My name is Rivesh Mantilax. Seruba Velak is my wife. Her
ship was attacked by pirates. She was an ambassador of my people. The
pirates were paid to ensure she never reached her destination. She
transmitted a distress signal, but by then we were at war. <br>
DOCTOR: With the Viperox. <br>
RIVESH: Yes. They had sabotaged the alliance my wife had tried to
negotiate against them. The war was long and savage, and I had a duty
to my people. But the torture of watching my species slaughtered was
nothing to the loss of my wife. When I could, I came for her. <br>
DOCTOR: And let me guess. The military had Seruba Velak. The Roswell
crash. So they were already looking for more spaceships, and they shot
you down. <br>
RIVESH: Without provocation. <br>
DOCTOR: Forgive them. They're primitive people, and scare easily. <br>
CASSIE: We've seen your wife. She's alive. <br>
RIVESH: Tell me they have not harmed her. <br>
DOCTOR: I think she's all right, and I'm going to get you both home. Or
at least to whatever might be left after a war with the Viperox. <br>
STARK: No, I don't think you will, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Colonel Stark. <br>
STARK: On behalf of the United States government, thank you for leading
us to this alien. You just helped me save the world. <br>
DOCTOR: For the first time in nine hundred years, why does that feel
like bad news?

again. <br>
DOCTOR: You'd think Stark could be more forgiving, as accidentally
leading him to Rivesh Mantilax has somehow saved the world, apparently.
<br>
NIGHT EAGLE: Men like Stark don't save worlds. All they know is
destruction. <br>

STARK: He's a scientist. A specialist in genetic warfare. You know what
that is? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Not pleasant. <br>
AZLOK: Rivesh Mantilax had developed a weapon genetically targeted at
the Viperox, to wipe us from the universe. <br>
JIMMY: Doesn't sound like such a bad thing. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Jimmy, it is. A very bad thing. Who's to say one day even
the Viperox won't discover a better way to exist. <br>
CASSIE: But I don't get it, Colonel. Why are you in cahoots with the
Viperox? <br>
(Stark lights up part of the world map - USSR.) <br>
STARK: The weapon can be modified to wipe out our enemies instead. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean Russia? <br>
STARK: The Reds are sitting on a thousand nukes, and everyone of them
has Uncle Sam's name on it. <br>
NIGHT EAGLE: The Russians will never fire them. They know as well as
you that would be the end of the world. <br>
DOCTOR: Does President Eisenhower know about this plan? <br>
STARK: Heck, the President doesn't even know aliens exist. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, anyway, it's irrelevant, as you don't have the weapon, do
you, Colonel. <br>
(Enter Dread, sparking occasionally.) <br>
JIMMY: Hey, I thought he blew a gasket. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's the trouble with robots. You can never be sure
you've shut them down. Twist a few wires together and they're
anybody's, isn't that right, Lord Azlok? <br>
DREAD: I retrieved the ionic fusion bar. <br>
DOCTOR: Except it's not an ionic fusion bar, is it. I've worked that
much out. Why would the Alliance of Shades have been more interested in
ignition systems than a Viperox horde? <br>
CASSIE: Because it's really a weapon? <br>
DOCTOR: Cleverly disguise to fool even me. And a weapon that could kill
billions throughout the universe. And now you expect Rivesh Mantilax to
reprogram it to wipe out the whole of Russia? <br>
AZLOK: It is the only way to make my kind safe, and he will do it. <br>
DOCTOR: Only if you still have the weapon. <br>

weapon you will kill millions of innocent people. <br>
STARK: You're talking like a Red. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me, Colonel. You cannot trust Lord Azlok. There's a
Viperox Queen giving birth to an army out there. Once this weapon is
reprogrammed, there is nothing to stop them attacking Earth. <br>
STARK: A bunch of supersized cockroaches against tanks and bombers? I'd
like to see them try it. <br>
DOCTOR: Ask Rivesh Mantilax and Seruba Velak. Their technology is a
thousand years of Earth. They couldn't stop the Viperox. How will you?
Who are you going to be, Colonel? The man who saves the world, or the
one who destroys it. <br>
(The Colonel thinks for a few moments, then lowers his gun and speaks
into his walkie-talkie.) <br>

STARK: Soldiers, put Lord Azlok under arrest. <br>

them, and they have very good hearing. <br>
(Azlok bursts through the door onto the roof.) <br>
STARK: Consider yourself a prisoner of the United States Army. <br>
AZLOK: We have laid waste to entire galaxies. The United States and
Earth itself will be as dust beneath our feet. <br>
DOCTOR: Not if I can help it. Take my advice and go home, while you
still can. <br>
AZLOK: Because you have the genetic weapon? Without Rivesh Mantilax it
is useless. <br>

SERUBA: My husband. <br>

STARK: Can we activate the weapon without him? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you're all heart, aren't you, Colonel. No, it's attuned to
his DNA. That's why Lord Azlok needed him to
reprogram it. Or, better still, needed him dead. <br>
SERUBA: He's not yet passed. I can save him! I need to get to the
