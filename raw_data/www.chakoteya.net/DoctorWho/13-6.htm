<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In the most inhospitable place on Earth, two men
are using small pickaxes to gather samples at the base of a glacier
face.) <br>
MOBERLEY: Come on, Charles. We've got enough samples, surely.&nbsp;<br>
WINLETT: This isn't ice. This is something else. Have a look. <br>
(He lifts a round object of about six inches diameter out of the snow.)
<br>
MOBERLEY: What is it? <br>
WINLETT: I don't know. Let's get it back to camp.

removed from the object.) <br>
MOBERLEY: Ah. Animal, vegetable, or mineral? <br>
STEVENSON: Vegetable. <br>
WINLETT: Yes, that's what we thought. <br>
STEVENSON: The cutaneous creasing is unmistakable. When it's properly
thawed out I can confirm it with a cytology test. <br>
WINLETT: The skin looks as hard as iron. <br>
STEVENSON: Yes, it is a bit of a cannonball. How deep in the permafrost
was it? <br>
WINLETT: I guess about the ninth layer. <br>
MOBERLEY: That means it's been there for oh, twenty thousand years?
Well, what do you make of it, John? <br>
STEVENSON: Nothing at all yet. <br>
MOBERLEY Oh, and I thought you were meant to be a botanist. <br>
STEVENSON: I've not seen anything remotely like it. <br>
WINLETT: It looks tropical to me, like a gourd. <br>
MOBERLEY: Oh rubbish, Charles. If it's from the late Pleistocene
period, it can't be tropical. It's a few million years since this part
of Antarctica was rainforest. <br>
WINLETT: That's the accepted theory. Discoveries like this have
destroyed accepted theories before now. Isn't that right, John? <br>
(Stevenson touches the object with his bare fingers.) <br>
WINLETT: John? <br>
STEVENSON: Hmm? Sorry. <br>
MOBERLEY: Is something wrong? <br>
STEVENSON: Don't you feel it? <br>
MOBERLEY: Feel what? <br>
STEVENSON: I don't know. There's something odd. Something. You don't
feel it? <br>
MOBERLEY: That must be that rice pudding you had for lunch. <br>
STEVENSON: I'm not joking. It's alive. That's it, it's alive. <br>
MOBERLEY: Are you serious? <br>
STEVENSON: Yes. <br>
WINLETT: How can you tell? <br>
STEVENSON: I don't know, but I'm certain that this is a living
organism. <br>
MOBERLEY: Yes, well, I think we should have some coffee. <br>
WINLETT: Coffee and a game of three-handed crib. Good idea. Come on. <br>
STEVENSON: I'll transmit pictures to London. They might have some idea.
<br>
WINLETT: John, come on.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In London, at the World Ecology Bureau, a
bureaucrat has a visitor in his rather cramped office.)<br>
DUNBAR: Sir Colin insists that I show you these photographs which have
just been received from my expedition. <br>
(The Doctor is sitting on Dunbar's desk, playing with his yoyo.) <br>
DUNBAR: Personally, I don't think you can help us. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you. Well. <br>
(Dunbar gives him the file.) <br>
DOCTOR: Do sit down, Mister Dunbar. <br>
(With the Doctor blocking the way to his own chair, Dunbar sits in the
guest seat.) <br>
DUNBAR: These pictures have baffled all the experts. The only
reasonable explanation seems to be that the pod is from some extinct
species of plant. <br>
(The Doctor sits in Dunbar's chair with his feet on the desk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Have you considered an alternative explanation? <br>
DUNBAR: Name one. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that it might have originated in outer space. <br>
DUNBAR: My dear Doctor, if you've seen anything like that before, you
must have a very powerful telescope. <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Dunbar, how long is it since there was vegetation in
Antarctica? <br>
DUNBAR: I thought you were the expert in these matters. Well, as a
matter of fact, that's one of the things our expedition is trying to
discover. It was found fairly deep in the permafrost, say twenty thirty
thousand years under the ice. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. It might still be ticking. <br>
DUNBAR: What? <br>
DOCTOR: A time-bomb, Mister Dunbar, a time-bomb. Are you in contact
with the expedition? <br>
DUNBAR: My superior, Sir Colin Thackeray has a daily video link. Ten
minutes of satellite time. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Tell them to keep a constant guard upon the pod, and not
to touch it till I arrive. <br>
DUNBAR: You're leaving immediately? <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? I've got my toothbrush. Remember, no touch pod. Could
be dangerous. (The Doctor leaves, brandishing his toothbrush. Dunbar
picks up the telephone.) <br>
DUNBAR: Sir Colin? Dunbar here. That chap you called in from UNIT. Is
he quite sane?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Stevenson is measuring the pod's diameter.) <br>
STEVENSON: Incredible. Charles? <br>
WINLETT [OC]: Yes? <br>
STEVENSON: Come in here a minute. <br>
(Winlett enters.) <br>
WINLETT: What's up? <br>
STEVENSON: It's growing. <br>
WINLETT: Eh? <br>
STEVENSON: It's grown five centimetres since this morning. <br>
WINLETT: Are you sure? <br>
STEVENSON: Check it yourself if you don't believe me. <br>
WINLETT: But it doesn't seem possible. <br>
STEVENSON: I knew there was still life there. I said so, didn't I? <br>
WINLETT: But it's just a pod. I mean, no root system. How can it grow
without feeding? <br>
STEVENSON: Sunlight, Charles. Ultra-violet radiation. <br>
WINLETT: But plants need nitrogen. <br>
STEVENSON: I believe this is fundamentally different. We may be
cultivating something that's going to shatter all our ideas about plant
growth. <br>
WINLETT: Yes, well, don't get carried away, John. Remember what London
said. <br>
STEVENSON: What do you mean? <br>
WINLETT: About leaving this thing alone. <br>
STEVENSON: Until this Doctor character arrives, why should we? It's our
pod. <br>
WINLETT: John, we're working for the World Ecology Bureau. <br>
STEVENSON: Oh, he's probably some old crank that Thackeray's dug up out
of retirement. He'll have no more idea about the pod than we have. <br>
WINLETT: We'll soon find out. He's due in tomorrow. <br>
STEVENSON: And who needs him. It's our discovery. The less said about
it the better.

Dorset. The butler shows Dunbar into a part of Harrison Chase's mansion
which is given over to the cultivation of tropical plants. The master
of the house wears black leather gloves at all times.) <br>
HARGREAVES: Mister Dunbar of the World Ecology Bureau, sir. <br>
(Hargreaves leaves.) <br>
CHASE: I don't think I've had the pleasure. And what is your Bureau
doing about bonsai? <br>
DUNBAR: Bonsai, Mister Chase? <br>
CHASE: Mutilation and torture, Mister Dunbar. The hideous, grotesque
Japanese practice of miniaturising shrubs and trees. What is your
Bureau doing about that? <br>
DUNBAR: Well, I <br>
CHASE: No answer. You are concerned about the fate of the blue whale,
and the natterjack toad, but the loveliest, most defenceless part of
creation, the great kingdom of plant life receives no protection at
all. <br>
DUNBAR: We try to conserve all the endangered species. <br>
CHASE: I'm delighted to hear that, Mister Dunbar. Of course you know of
my concern, my mission, to protect the plant life of Mother Earth? <br>
DUNBAR: I do, Mister Chase. Which is why I've come to show you
something. A totally new kind of plant. <br>
CHASE: Hybrids. A crime against nature <br>
DUNBAR: No, not a hybrid. It's a mysterious, unidentified pod recently
discovered by one of our expeditions. <br>
(Dunbar hands Chase the photographs.) <br>
CHASE: Where was this found? <br>
DUNBAR: There's a theory that it's floated through space from some
other biosphere. The really important thing is, it may be still viable
and able to germinate. <br>
CHASE: Mister Dunbar, I asked you where this pod was found. <br>
DUNBAR: In the Antarctic. Now, in our violent and uncertain world,
Mister Chase, anything could happen. Such a valuable specimen could
easily disappear for a price. <br>
CHASE: Where in the Antarctic? I should want to know the precise
location. <br>
(Dunbar gives Chase an envelope. Chase then goes over to an intercom
system.) <br>
CHASE: Hargreaves? <br>
HARGREAVES [OC]: Yes, sir? <br>
CHASE: You and Mister Scorby please. <br>
HARGREAVES [OC]: Certainly, sir. <br>
(Chase opens the envelope.) <br>
DUNBAR: X marks the spot. <br>
CHASE: Forethought and initiative, Mister Dunbar. Two excellent
attributes. We shall meet again very soon to discuss your remuneration.
<br>
DUNBAR: You're very kind. <br>
(There is a knock on the door.) <br>
CHASE: Come. <br>
(Hargreaves and Scorby enter. Everyone say Hi to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0149998/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> John Challis</a>, before
he became Boycie in Only Fools.) <br>
HARGREAVES: Yes, sir? <br>
CHASE: Hargreaves, show Mister Dunbar out. <br>
HARGREAVES: This way, Mister Dunbar. <br>
(Hargreaves and Dunbar leave.) <br>
SCORBY: You wanted to see me, Mister Chase? <br>
CHASE: Yes, Scorby. I'm sending you on a little errand, and I want you
to take Mister Keeler with you.

off. He wakes again and takes a sip of his drink, puts the mug down and

warm but it's dropping hourly. <br>
DOCTOR: And the pulse rate? <br>
STEVENSON: His body temperature is forty six, his pulse rate is
eighteen a minute. I'm no medical expert, but on those figures he
should be dead, shouldn't he? <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder. <br>
(The Doctor pulls back the sheet. Winlett's body is covered in green
tendrils.) <br>

we took it out of the ice. I was certain there was still life there. I
put in under a lamp and it started to expand. <br>

SCORBY: Well, there was this other pod, and one of the expedition
apparently got infected by it. <br>
CHASE: Yes, so I heard. What happened exactly? <br>
KEELER: It was all very strange. He went mad and killed somebody. <br>
SCORBY: Yeah, they told us the pod took him over in some way. <br>

CHASE: Ah, come in, Dunbar. It's all right. These are the two men who
brought back the pod. <br>
(Hargreaves leaves.) <br>
CHASE: They know of your contribution to the enterprise. <br>
DUNBAR: I had no idea you'd go to such terrible lengths to get it. <br>
CHASE: The destruction of the others was necessary. <br>
DUNBAR: Necessary? <br>
CHASE: There it is. Look at it. Like me, I imagine you couldn't wait to
see it with your own eyes. <br>
DUNBAR: Unlike you, I can hardly bear to look at it, considering the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> THACKERAY: But why should people go to such
lengths to get their hands on the pod? <br>
DOCTOR: Greed. Greed. The most dangerous impulse in the universe. Do
you realise that on this planet the pod is unique? I use the word with
precision. Unique. And to some people, its uniqueness makes it valuable
at any cost. <br>
DUNBAR: You make these two mystery men sound like fanatics. <br>
DOCTOR: Fanatics? Tell him. You tell him. You tell him! <br>
SARAH: These two mystery men had everything planned. They had an
aeroplane, guns, even a bomb. It was organised down to the last detail.
Now, if that isn't fanaticism, well, what is? <br>
DUNBAR: Surely you're exaggerating. <br>
SARAH: Exaggerate? Now look, I was there. We were nearly killed! <br>
DOCTOR: Be calm. Be calm. Listen, both of you. Are you both listening
to me? I think they were dangerous, but they were stooges. I believe
they were working for someone else. <br>
SARAH: And if that's true, that someone else must be a complete madman.
<br>
DOCTOR: What's more to the point is how they knew of the pod's
existence. The discovery had been reported only to your department,
correct? <br>
THACKERAY: That's correct. But Doctor, I trust you're not suggesting
that information was leaked from this bureau? <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? Why shouldn't it be? <br>
DUNBAR: Doctor, how can you suggest such a thing? <br>
THACKERAY: In any case, what would be the gain? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, money. <br>
DUNBAR: Money? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, money. Hired thieves and murderers don't usually work for
love. <br>
DUNBAR: Since you seem to have it all sewn up, Doctor, perhaps you can
tell us where the pod is now? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll make a guess. Right here, in this country. Action! Action,
that's what we need. If we don't find that pod before it germinates,
it'll be the end of everything. Everything, you understand? Even your
pension! <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Plant lab]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Never mind us. Order that attack, it's
your only chance. Out. <br>
(The Doctor goes in search of Sarah.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Grounds]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RAF [OC]: I'll be with you in figures three
minutes. Over. <br>
BERESFORD: Roger, Red Leader. Out. <br>
(Beresford goes to Thackeray.) <br>
BERESFORD: Well, the planes are on their way. Three minutes. <br>
THACKERAY: Is there no way we can get them out? <br>
BERESFORD: Not a chance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Compost room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (As a flight of five jets head towards their
target, Chase is trussing up an unconscious Sarah in the compost
machine. Then he switches it on and stand backs to watch. Sarah wakes
up and the Doctor bursts in. Chase briefly struggles with him but is
easily pushed away. The Doctor switches off the machine and jumps into
the hopper to untie Sarah. He lifts her out as Chase switches the
machine on again. Chase grabs the Doctor and is pulled inside the
hopper as he wrestles with him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quick, Sarah, the button. The button! <br>
SARAH: I can't <br>
(The Doctor climbs out of the hopper but Chase hands on to one arm.
Sarah still has her hands tied behind her as she hops up and down
trying to reach the control panel. Finally, Chase's gloves hands slide
off the Doctor's sleeve and he goes into the shredder with a scream.
The Doctor unties Sarah properly.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah, I tried to save him. He was trying to pull me in. <br>
(Sarah sobs and they leave the grisly room.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Grounds]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Two jets fly overhead at low level.) <br>
BERESFORD: That was a sighting run. Scorpio section to Red Leader.
Over. <br>
RAF [OC]: Red Leader section. We see your target. We're turning to
attack now. Over. <br>
BERESFORD: Understood. Good luck. Out. <br>
THACKERAY: Still no sign of the Doctor. <br>
BERESFORD: Afraid not. <br>
RAF [OC]: (unintelligible) again. Let's turn it into chop suey. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Another door to the outside is blocked by
foliage.) <br>
SARAH: Where do we go? We've a Krynoid outside, steam inside, bombs
overhead. <br>
DOCTOR: Steam. Steam! <br>
(The Doctor goes to a set of pipes in the wall and starts to undo one
of them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stand by that door, Sarah. <br>
SARAH: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: When I say. Come on, come on. <br>
(He unfastens a pipe, puts his hat over the end as he turns it towards
the doorway, then) <br>
DOCTOR: Now! <br>
(Sarah opens the door, the Doctor takes his hat off the pipe and hot
steam gushes at the plants outside. They stop moving.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Grounds]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Sarah fight their way through the
unhappy foliage to an area of felled trees. They take cover behind a
large log as the RAF begin their attack run. The first strike takes out
part of the house, the second hits the Krynoid. So does the third, and
lumps of green fly everywhere, then the whole building explodes.
Historic property and alien plant burn up in the intense fire.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Thackeray's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> THACKERAY: Well, Doctor, do you think we've heard
the last of the Krynoid? <br>
DOCTOR: Sir Colin, the Intergalactic Floral Society, of which quite
naturally I'm the President, finds Krynoids a difficult subject to
study. Their researchers tend to disappear. <br>
SARAH: Hmm, I can imagine. A case of one veg and no meat. <br>
THACKERAY: Very neat, Miss Smith. <br>
SARAH: Sorry about that. <br>
THACKERAY: And talking of societies, Doctor, the Royal Horticultural
Society's got wind of this affair. They'd rather like you to address
one of their meetings. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? When? <br>
THACKERAY: I think they suggested the fifteenth. <br>
DOCTOR: Fifteenth, fifteenth. No, impossible. I'm fully booked for the
next two centuries, but any time after that. <br>
THACKERAY: Doctor, I don't know when you're being serious. <br>
SARAH: I know just how you feel, Sir Colin. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you ever heard of Cassiopeia? <br>
SARAH: Animal, vegetable or mineral? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a good place for a holiday. We need a break. Come on. <br>
SARAH: Oh, great! <br>
DOCTOR: Sir Colin, do you fancy a little excursion? <br>
THACKERAY: I'd be delighted, but my wife's expecting me home for tea. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Antarctica]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises in a white landscape.
Sarah runs out in swimming costume and carrying a beach ball then
suddenly stops.) <br>
SARAH: Ah, this isn't Cassiopeia. <br>
DOCTOR: It's Antarctica. <br>
SARAH: We're back where we started! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SARAH: We won't get a suntan here. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
SARAH: You forgot to cancel the coordinate programme, didn't you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SARAH: Shall we try again? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Just a minute. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Have we been here before, or <br>
BOTH: Are we yet to come? </font> </p>
