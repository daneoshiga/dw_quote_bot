<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A delta wave of classic flying saucers flies
through space. We watch one of them land on a planet, its landing
struts holding the body of the saucer clear of the rocky ground. A
transport tube is lowered, and the outer and inner doors open. A
humanoid steps out onto the planet. The high curved shoulders of his
outfit make him look as if his neck is joined part way down his chest.
As he surveys the scenery, a second man joins him. The first man
speaks.) <br>
RAGO: Is the local radiation completely absorbed? <br>
(Played by the handsome <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0021004" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Ronald
Allen</a>, if you're interested.) <br>
TOBA: Yes, its energy's been transferred to our fuel reserves. But we
need much more. <br>
RAGO: Of course, that is why we are here. <br>
TOBA: With respect, Navigator Rago, I still consider we should have
continued to Epsilon Four. <br>
RAGO: I decided otherwise, Probationer Toba. <br>
TOBA: But this planet has never been fully surveyed. <br>
RAGO: It's suitable for our purpose. The planetary crust is thin here,
and there is a intelligent form of life suitable for a work force. <br>
TOBA: But the natives may not be suitable for slave labour. Suppose
they're hostile? <br>
RAGO: If necessary we shall destroy them. <br>
TOBA: Yes, destroy them. <br>
RAGO: But only if necessary. Commence work on the preliminary survey. <br>
TOBA: Command accepted. Shall I order the Quarks to mark out the
drilling sites? <br>
RAGO: Yes. <br>
TOBA: Quarks!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Elsewhere, a large egg-shaped craft is travelling
through the mists. The humanoids in here wear thick corset-style
dresses over sleeveless singlets, and seem far less belligerent than
the newcomers.) <br>
WAHED: (dark top) I'm not so sure that this so-called adventure was
such a good idea after all. I mean, this is a terribly primitive way to
travel isn't it? <br>
ETNIN: (floor length long sleeves) Well, we are supposed to be looking
for excitement, aren't we? <br>
TOLATA: (woman) That's why I came. <br>
WAHED: I really don't see what's so exciting about sitting for hours on
end in this old tub. If we'd used a travel capsule we could have been
here in a few minutes. <br>
CULLY: (pilot - knee length, light top) Not without a permit, you
wouldn't. <br>
WAHED: I suppose that does add a little zest. <br>
CULLY: Well, here we are everyone, the Island of Death! Uninhabited for
one hundred and seventy years. Nothing can live on this poisonous plot
of soil. <br>
WAHED: You're being melodramatic again, Cully, as usual. You know
perfectly well there's a permanent survey unit there to monitor the
radiation. <br>
ETNIN: And there's a weekly visit by parties of students to show them
the horror of atomic radiation. <br>
CULLY: All right, all right, I know. But all this is organised and
supervised by the state. You've travelled miles by sea in a ship
navigated by man. None of your auto-piloting. And don't forget we're
here without permits. All this is illegal. <br>
ETNIN: Yes, I'd almost forgotten that. <br>
CULLY: An adventure with Cully is something never to be forgotten. <br>
WAHED: It doesn't look any different to me from the way I've seen it in
vision-books on my own screen at home. <br>
CULLY: Ah, but this time it's real. <br>
WAHED: Is it? <br>
CULLY: Well yes, of course it is. You're actually here. <br>
WAHED: Are we? <br>
CULLY: You don't believe me. <br>
WAHED: Well, you could be throwing up old pictures on your scanner,
couldn't you? After all, there's nothing to show that it is real. <br>
CULLY: Well you can't get out and see. <br>
WAHED: Why not? <br>
TOLATA: Yes, why not? <br>
CULLY: Look, I'm all for a bit of danger, but going out on that island
without protective suits would be madness. <br>
WAHED: So we just have to take your word for it, Cully. <br>
CULLY: Yes you do. <br>
TOLATA: Didn't you mention something about a warning signal? <br>
CULLY: Yes, when we're in the radiation zone. Why? <br>
TOLATA: Well, aren't we a bit close? <br>
ETNIN: Do something, Cully! <br>
WAHED: We're going to crash! <br>
TOLATA: Quickly, Cully! <br>
(The enclosed craft slams into the beach at the bask of a cliff and
everyone gets thrown to the floor. Wahed hurts his elbow.) <br>
CULLY: We're stuck. <br>
WAHED: Mm? <br>
TOLATA: Oh no! <br>
WAHED: Do you mean permanently? <br>
CULLY: Yes, we've run aground. The drive is well and truly wedged in
solid. <br>
WAHED: Well, how are we supposed to get back to the mainland? <br>
CULLY: Look, don't ask me. <br>
ETNIN: This really is an adventure, isn't it. <br>
WAHED: Are you sure this isn't one of your practical jokes, Cully? <br>
CULLY: Now look, running aground on an atomic island isn't my idea of
fun. <br>
WAHED: Yes, but is that where we really are? <br>
(Wahed waves a stick over some control panels.) <br>
WAHED: The radiation meter's registering zero. <br>
CULLY: Yes. Odd. Well, they've probably broken down. <br>
WAHED: Let's try again, shall we? Clear the computers. Now. <br>
CULLY: Zero? But it can't be. <br>
WAHED: So much for your navigation, Cully. Island of Death. <br>
(A ramp drops down onto the beach and Etnin walks out.) <br>
CULLY: All right, go out there. Get yourselves cooked to a frazzle by
the radiation, but don't come complaining to me if you get yourselves
killed, because I don't refund money to <br>
(But they have all left.) <br>
CULLY: Refund? What am I saying, they haven't even paid me yet! Hey,
wait! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the hovercraft]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> CULLY: Oh Tolata, don't be a little fool. This
island is a killer. <br>
TOLATA: So you say, but your radiation counter didn't seem to be making
too much of a fuss about it. <br>
CULLY: Yes, I know, but, well, it must have gone bust. <br>
WAHED: And all the others in this tub of yours as well? <br>
TOLATA: Why don't you admit it, Cully. You're a rogue, This isn't the
test island, is it. <br>
CULLY: But I tell you it is! <br>
ETNIN: Wahed! Over the hill. People. <br>
WAHED: People? Well, that settles it rather, doesn't it Cully? No one
ever visits the Island of Death, do they. <br>
CULLY: Well, there's the survey unit, or they could be students. Were
they wearing protective suits? <br>
ETNIN: No, but they had a new type of robot. <br>
WAHED: A work party most probably. Come on Etnin, let's go and seek
their assistance in getting us off this dreary island which Cully has
so carelessly marooned us on. <br>
CULLY: No, wait! Wahed! Stop!

TOBA: Quarks, destroy them! <br>
CULLY: Oh get down, quickly! They're going to. Get down! <br>
(Cully ducks down behind a dune as the other three suddenly freeze then
fall.) <br>
TOBA: Quarks, reload force units. <br>

The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe come out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, oh yes. Ahh! <br>
JAMIE: Are you still feeling tired, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, just a little bit weary, Jamie. It's a very exhausting
business projecting all those mental images, you know. <br>
ZOE: You need a good rest, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we all do. A nice holiday. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, where did you say this place was again? <br>
ZOE: Well the scanner screen in the Tardis showed it as an island of
some sort surrounded by a sea of mist. <br>
JAMIE: Aye. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's an island on Dulkis, a perfectly splendid planet. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, I've heard that one before. <br>
ZOE: And there won't be any Cybermen or Daleks, will there? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, of course not. There's nothing unpleasant on
Dulkis. <br>
ZOE: Well, is the whole island as dreary as this? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, goodness me, no. They're a very advanced race, the
Dulcians. And they're very gentle too. And friendly. You're going to
like them. <br>
(The Doctor hands Zoe a large keep net.) <br>
JAMIE: Oh I see, you've been here before. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, Jamie. Blow that up for me would you? <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
(The Doctor gives him an inflatable ball.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Some time ago, mind you. It was splendid. It was so
peaceful. I just didn't want to leave. <br>
(He brings out a deckchair and sits down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what we all need. A nice, peaceful holiday.

way along, Cully starts down the slope to his craft.) <br>
TOBA: Quarks. Destroy the alien vessel. <br>

hovercraft goes kaBOOM! and he plays dead just in case.)

running.) <br>
JAMIE: I thought you said it was a peaceful planet? <br>
ZOE: Well which direction did it come from? It sounded as though it was
almost on top of us. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, now would you look at that. <br>
(Jamie walks through the missing side of a building made of hexagonal
blocks.) <br>
ZOE: Did you say these people were peaceful Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well yes, Zoe, they. But Dulcians are gentle and friendly! <br>
JAMIE: Aye, it sounded like it. Did the explosion cause this? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. This was caused by an explosion some time ago,
Jamie. <br>
ZOE: Looks like atomic blast damage to me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you're right, Zoe. But I don't understand it.
Let's look inside, shall we? <br>
(The Doctor helps Zoe over some fallen debris as they go to a metal
door in an intact wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Mind. Over here.

nicely.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, what sort of place is this? <br>
ZOE: Looks like some sort of museum. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right again, Zoe. A war museum! <br>
JAMIE: Peaceful, you said. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, but these are very old fashioned weapons, Jamie. This
sort of thing was banned ages ago. <br>
(Jamie takes a ray gun off it's display stand.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, how you work this sort of thing? <br>
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, no! Put that down!&nbsp;<br>
JAMIE: What's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a sort of laser gun. You know what that'll do. It'll
burn a hole through anything. Metal, concrete, wood, anything! It may
look old, but, well, you never know. It just might go off. Now please,
just leave things as they were. Where was it? <br>
ZOE: I wonder what's down here? <br>
JAMIE: Is that the trigger there? <br>
DOCTOR: Well that seems to be something <br>
ZOE: Look! <br>
JAMIE: What's the matter? What? <br>
(Zoe points at two motionless figures.) <br>
JAMIE: What's happened to them? <br>
DOCTOR: Stay here, Zoe. Come on, Jamie. <br>
(The Doctor goes down the steps to the figures then laughs.) <br>
JAMIE: Well, what are you laughing at? Oh, they're just dummies! What
did they put them in here for? <br>
DOCTOR: They're dummies. <br>
ZOE: Dummies? Did you check? DOCTOR: Huh? <br>
ZOE: Did you check the radiation level before we left the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: That's just what I was thinking. Zoe, I think I did, I. Yes,
I'm sure I did. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, what are you two on about? <br>
ZOE: Well I was just thinking. This place reminds me of the old
atom-test islands on Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think you're right, Zoe. <br>
JAMIE: Test islands? <br>
ZOE: For atomic weapons, Jamie. <br>
DOCTOR: But, but, but why on Dulkis? They've outlawed war! There must
be some other explanation. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, well, I vote we go back to the Tardis and find somewhere
else. <br>
ZOE: Doctor! <br>

BALAN: (older man) Oh, I hope we're not too late. If they were out
there for any length of time. How badly are they affected? <br>
KANDO: (girl) I don't know, Educator Balan. <br>
BALAN: Oh, come now, Kando. I've taught you how to read a radiation
meter. But this is registering negative. Are you sure you've switched
it on? <br>
KANDO: Yes. <br>
BALAN: How is yours, Teel? <br>
TEEL: (boy) Exactly the same, sir, Zero. <br>
BALAN: It's very strange. <br>
(There is thumping and shouting off screen.) <br>
TEEL: Could it be that the meters aren't working, sir? <br>
BALAN: Oh no, the warning lights would have gone on if the circuits had
failed. <br>
KANDO: Well, we can't leave them in there indefinitely. <br>
BALAN: No, that's true. Teel, as they're not radioactive we may as well
let them out. (Teel opens a door, and the Doctor, Jamie, Zoe and a lot
of steam come out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my beautiful coat is all wet. <br>
ZOE: Thank goodness for that. <br>
JAMIE: Ridiculous! <br>
DOCTOR: All this is totally unnecessary, you know. There's not a trace
of contamination on us. <br>
BALAN: Yes, so I've noticed. It's odd isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: What's odd about it? <br>
BALAN: Well, the whole island is radioactive. It has been for a hundred
and seventy two years, you must know that. <br>
ZOE: Well it isn't now. <br>
KANDO: Of course it is. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you checked? <br>
TEEL: Well, not yet. We've only just arrived. We'll be taking the
annual readings during the next few days. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if I were you I'd take them now. <br>
BALAN: I wasn't aware that anyone else had permission to work on the
island except ourselves. Tell me exactly what has been happening. <br>
DOCTOR: But, but I was hoping you were going to tell us that. <br>
ZOE: This is an atom test island, isn't it? <br>
BALAN: Oh but of course. Everybody knows that. <br>
JAMIE: Ah, well, we don't. <br>
DOCTOR: But atomic weapons on Dulkis? I thought war had been abolished
here. <br>
BALAN: It has. You seem to know surprisingly little about your own
planet. <br>
JAMIE: Ah well, that's it, you see. We've just come in the Tar <br>
(The Doctor gestures Jamie to be quiet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, as Jamie was about to say, we come from a different
world, from a different time. <br>
BALAN: Not from this world? Really, that's very interesting. I must
note that in my daily report. <br>
ZOE: Well, you don't sound very surprised. <br>
BALAN: Well, it does explain how you came to expose yourself to the
dangers on this island. No Dulcian would do such a foolish thing. <br>
JAMIE: Oh? What are you doing here then? <br>
KANDO: We're part of Educator Balan's expedition from the university. <br>
DOCTOR: But when I was here some time ago, you were a peaceful race.
What <br>
BALAN: Ah, so you've been here before? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, yes. <br>
BALAN: Ah, I must put that in my. I'm so sorry. You were saying? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, well, what's happened to you? I thought aggressive
weapons had been abolished? <br>
BALAN: Oh, indeed they have, under the second council, under Director
Olin. He banned the manufacture of all weapons. <br>
DOCTOR: Then what are you doing letting off atomic devices all over the
place? <br>
BALAN: Oh, there was only one explosion. Perhaps my pupil Kando should
explain. Let's see how much you remember, my dear. <br>
KANDO: Er. <br>
BALAN: The Seventh Council. <br>
KANDO: The Seventh Council under Director Malos initiated research
which led to the development of atomic energy. The dest <br>
BALAN: Destructive capabilities. <br>
KANDO: The destructive capabilities of this were immediately apparent,
and <br>
BALAN: This island. <br>
KANDO: And this island was used to test an explosive device, the
results of which can be seen today. Thereafter all further research
into this type of energy was prohibited, and the island was kept as
both a museum and warning for future generations. <br>
JAMIE: Oh well, she certainly does her homework. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Then this is an atomic test site? <br>
BALAN: Oh, yes. You see, students are. That was really very good,
Kando. Students are brought here to test the radiation level and
observe the effect on the vegetation. And of course, to see for
themselves the horrors of atomic destruction. <br>
ZOE: So there should be radioactivity here? <br>

people have been killed, a spacecraft has landed, radioactivity has
disappeared, and there are robots on that island. Now I may have a
pretty inventive mind, but I wouldn't have dreamt up that lot, now

of your desire to gratify a need for pointless destruction. <br>

we destroy. That which is too weak to harm us we ignore. <br>
TOBA: Are they so harmless, these primitives? They've disobeyed us,
they've attacked us, even here on this small island. The rest of the

You will concern yourself with obeying my orders and nothing more. I
will report your conduct to Fleet Leader. <br>

humiliated me before members of an inferior race. Perhaps it is you who
is not fit to be a Dominator. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, now's our chance to investigate the power unit and find
out what fuel this ship carries. <br>

capable of producing a high enough energy quotient to sustain an
amplifying complex of considerably sophisticated design. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Must be pretty powerful too. <br>
ZOE: Yes, well that's what. Well, if you don't want my help. <br>

cells are located? <br>

DOCTOR: But there was no reactor in their ship of theirs, only a

drill hole in the centre. Now then, they have rockets mounted in each
of these drill holes, and the centre hole is probably for that atomic
seed device. <br>
JAMIE: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Well don't you see? They've chosen this spot because the crust
of the planet is thin. They're going to fire the rockets through the
crust into the magma, the molten core. <br>

DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>

seed device in the middle of that <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Zoe. The whole planet will become one vast
molten mass of radioactive material. The fuel store for their fleet. <br>
JAMIE: Well, we'll just have to stop them, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, it's not as simple as that, is it? If only I could
get hold of that atomic seed device, I might be able to defuse it. <br>
ZOE: Yes. Then there'd only be a local volcanic eruption on the island.

JAMIE: Yes, now listen. You said they were going to drop it down the

DOCTOR: Yes. <br>

through from here to the borehole and catch the seed device thing on
it's way down. Well, it was just an idea. <br>

ZOE: We can get the direction from the periscope. Just line it up with

devise some sort of weapon for you. Is anything down here, Cully? <br>
CULLY: I doubt it. Nothing but survival rations and medical kits. <br>
DOCTOR: Medical kit, oh. It's surprising what you can do with a few
simple chemicals and a little ingenuity. Now come on, we must dig this

JAMIE: Well one of the Quark's as good as another. Come on. <br>

pill into a vial and Jamie tosses it over the edge.) <br>
JAMIE: Two, three, four, five <br>

JAMIE: Not quite. Quick, another one! <br>

comrade. Just a few smoking bits remain.) <br>

stop them drilling. Teel? Teel, how far have you got? <br>
TEEL: A little bit further than my own length. <br>
DOCTOR: Teel, come out and take your rest. Zoe, your turn. Come on. <br>

treated to a couple of near misses. Meanwhile, Rago comes to the
drilling point.) <br>

RAGO: Two more Quarks have been destroyed. <br>
TOBA: You should have let me destroy the aliens! <br>
RAGO: Silence! We have eight Quarks left, but their power levels are
very low. Do your two Quarks have sufficient power to complete the
drilling? <br>
TOBA: Quarks, check power levels and report. <br>
QUARK 1: Power level two units only. <br>
QUARK 2: Power level five units only. <br>
TOBA: Equalise. <br>

CULLY: Wait. It's my arm. I can't move it. Nor my leg. You'd better
leave me behind. <br>

DOCTOR: My word, lucky indeed! Come along, down you come. All right,
Cully. Get over to the bunk. Get the table out of the way. Here. There
we are. It's all right, Cully. Sit down. Mind your head. There we are,
there. Now then. <br>

temporary paralysis. <br>
