KENDRICK: The prototype has passed every test, sir. It's working. <br>
LUMIC: I hardly think working is the correct word. <br>
(Lumic moves his electric wheelchair forward.) <br>
LUMIC: That would apply only to machines. <br>
KENDRICK: I'm sorry. I should say, it's alive. <br>
LUMIC: Can it hear me? <br>
KENDRICK: It might still be in shock. Bear in mind the brain has been
welded to the exoskeleton. <br>
LUMIC: Skin of metal and a body that will never age or die. I envy it.
Do you know me? Answer. Do you know me? <br>
CYBERMAN: You are John Lumic. <br>
LUMIC: My child. Mark this day, Doctor Kendrick. We are blessed. <br>
KENDRICK: Well, it's not quite over yet, sir. We need Geneva's
approval. Technically, this is a new form of life, and that contravenes
the Bio-convention. They need to ratify this. <br>
LUMIC: And they will refuse me. <br>
KENDRICK: Nonetheless, we need to tell them. <br>
LUMIC: And if I don't? <br>
KENDRICK: Well then, I'm sorry, sir, but it's my duty. I shall have to
inform them. <br>
LUMIC: And how will you do that from beyond the grave? <br>
KENDRICK: I don't quite understand. <br>
LUMIC: Kill him. <br>
(The Cyberman puts a gauntlet on Kendrick's shoulder and sends
electricity through his body. Lumic turns away, smiling, and uses the
intercom on his wheelchair.) <br>
LUMIC: Captain? <br>
CAPTAIN [OC]: Yes, sir. <br>
LUMIC: Inform all staff. We have a new destination. Set sail for Great
Britain! </font></p>

MICKEY: Yeah. where was that, then? What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it was on this er, this er planet thing. Asteroid. It's a
long story, you had to be there. Er, what're you doing that for? <br>
MICKEY: Because you told me to. <br>
DOCTOR: When was that? <br>
MICKEY: About half an hour ago <br>
DOCTOR: Er, you can let go now. <br>
MICKEY: Well, how long's it been since I could've stopped? <br>
DOCTOR: Ten minutes? Twenty? Twenty nine? <br>
MICKEY: You just forgot me! <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I was just, I was, I was calibrating. I was just.
No, I know exactly what I'm doing. <br>

DOCTOR: The time vortex is gone. That's impossible. It's just gone.
Brace yourself! We're going to crash! <br>

DOCTOR: Everyone all right? Rose? Mickey? <br>
MICKEY: I'm fine. I'm okay. Sorry. Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: She's dead. The Tardis is dead. <br>
ROSE: You can fix it? <br>
DOCTOR: There's nothing to fix. She's perished. The last Tardis in the
universe. Extinct. <br>
ROSE: We can get help, yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: Where from? <br>
ROSE: Well, we've landed. We've got to be somewhere. <br>
DOCTOR: We fell out of the vortex, through the void, into nothingness.
We're in some sort of no place. The silent realm. The lost dimension. <br>

MICKEY: Okay, so it's London with a big international Zeppelin

DOCTOR: This is not your world. <br>
MICKEY: But if the date's the same, it's parallel, right? Am I right?
Like a parallel Earth where they've got Zeppelins. Am I right? I'm
right, aren't I? <br>
DOCTOR: Must be. <br>
ROSE: So, a parallel world where <br>
MICKEY: Oh, come on. You've seen it on films. Like an alternative to
our world where everything's the same but a little bit different, like,
I don't know, traffic lights are blue, Tony Blair never got elected. <br>
ROSE: And he's still alive. <br>
(Rose is staring at an advert for Vitex Lite, cherry flavour, starring
Pete Tyler.) <br>
ROSE: A parallel world and my dad's still alive. <br>

PETE [advert]: Trust me on this. <br>
ROSE: Well, that's weird. But he's real. <br>
PETE [advert]: Trust me on this. <br>
ROSE: He's a success. He was always planning these daft little schemes.
Health food, drinks and stuff. Everyone said they were useless. But he
did it. <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, if you've ever trusted me, then listen to me now. Stop
looking at it. Your father's dead. He died when you were six months
old. That is not your Pete. That is a Pete. For all we know, he's got
his own Jackie, his own Rose. His own daughter who is someone else, but
not you. You can't see him. Not ever. <br>

JACKIE: Rose? Come on, Rose! Look, you didn't even notice, did you?
Special delivery. Got sent round today. <br>

going to be honking. Rose, come to mummy! <br>

DOCTOR: Not in the real world. It used to be easy. When the Time Lords
kept their eye on everything, you could hop between realities, home in

reality closed, the worlds were sealed. Everything became that bit less

that God had disappeared you! <br>
MICKEY: That carpet on the stairs, I told you to get it fixed. You're

up the homeless like the child catcher. They must've took four dozen. <br>

MOORE: The vans were hired out to a company called International
Electromatics. But I did a protocol search. Turns out that's a dummy

LUMIC: The most precious thing on this Earth is the human brain, and
yet we allow it to die. But now Cybus Industries has perfected a way of
sustaining the brain indefinitely within a cradle of copyrighted
chemicals. And the latest advances in synapse research allows
cyberkinetic impulses to be bonded onto a metal exoskeleton. This is
the ultimate upgrade. Our greatest step into cyberspace. <br>
PRESIDENT: I'm sorry. Could we stop it there? I don't need the pitch. I
think we all know what this ultimate upgrade entails. And I'm here to
tell you, John, the answer is no. My government does not give you
permission. And I think no government ever will. <br>
LUMIC: I prepared a paper for the Ethical Committee. <br>
PRESIDENT: Oh, come on. It's not just unethical. It's obscene. <br>
LUMIC: Mister President, if I might make a personal plea. I am dying,
sir. <br>
PRESIDENT: I'm aware of that. And I'm very sorry. <br>
LUMIC: Without this project, you have condemned me. My inventions have
advanced this whole planet. Would you have all that perish? <br>
PRESIDENT: You're a fine businessman, John, but you're not God. I'm
really very sorry, but I think we should end it there. Mister Tyler,
I'll see you tonight. I think we could all do with a drink. Mister
Lumic. <br>

for. No work, no politics, just a few good mates and plenty of black

Enjoy, enjoy. <br>
DOCTOR: You can't stay. Even if there was some way of telling them. <br>
ROSE: Course I can't. I've still got Mum at home. My real mum. I
couldn't just leave her, could I. It's just, they've got each other.
