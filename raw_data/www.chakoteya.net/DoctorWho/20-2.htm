<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (On a patch of sand surrounded on two sides by
large stone slabs, an old man is sitting and meditating. He wears a
blue gem on a string around his neck. <br>
Meanwhile, Nyssa comes out of the interior of the Tardis wearing a
circular striped skirt over a pair of knee-length shorts and a bright
blouse, and shows her new costume off to the Doctor.) <br>
NYSSA: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: We're not where we're supposed to be. <br>
NYSSA: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. There are traces of anti-matter. <br>
NYSSA: Omega? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, highly unlikely he's still alive. It's not a navigational
malfunction either. <br>
NYSSA: Shall I wake Tegan? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, there's no danger, although it's puzzling. It's very
puzzling. <br>
(Tegan still sleeps as Nyssa fetches a large reference book.) <br>
NYSSA: (reads) Planet G139901KB in the Scrampus system. Local name,
Manussa. Type 314S. Inhabited. Atmosphere ninety eight percent Terra
normal, gravity ninety six percent Terra normal. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, at least we can breath the air. I suppose that's
something. You look different. <br>
NYSSA: Yes, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: The question is, how did we get here? <br>
NYSSA: There's more. (reads) Third planet in the Federation system.
Status, colony. Former homeworld Manussan Empire, destroyed. Former
homeworld Sumaran Empire, destroyed. Present economy, subsistence
agriculture and tourism. <br>
DOCTOR: Former homeworld? <br>
NYSSA: Manussan Empire. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, the other one. <br>
NYSSA: Sumaran Empire. <br>
DOCTOR: This is serious. Someone's been playing around. Who set the
coordinates? <br>
NYSSA: Well, you did. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Earlier, I was trying to teach both of you to read
the star charts. Now, one of you actually read out the coordinates for
me to set. Who was it? <br>
NYSSA: I can't remember. <br>
DOCTOR: It was Tegan. <br>
(Tegan is having a dream about being in a cavern temple, and walking up
some steps into an giant open snake's jaw. She screams, and wakes
herself up.) </font></p>

Meanwhile, Nyssa is at Tegan's side. The Doctor stands in the doorway.)
<br>
NYSSA: Tegan, what's the matter? What happened? <br>
TEGAN: It was the dream. <br>
DOCTOR: The dream? What dream? <br>
TEGAN: I can't, I can't remember. I can never remember. <br>
DOCTOR: But you've had this dream, this particular dream, before. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor, stop it. <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't you? <br>
TEGAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Always the same dream? <br>
TEGAN: Yes, I think so. The images fade so quickly. <br>
DOCTOR: But the same feelings of fear remain. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor. It doesn't matter. You're awake now. It was only a
dream. <br>
TEGAN: No, it wasn't, somehow. <br>
NYSSA: Tegan <br>
DOCTOR: She means it. I think she could be right. </font></p>

the statuette.) <br>
TANHA: Lon, you're not dressed yet. Ambril will be here in a moment. He
promised to show us the caves this morning. Have you forgotten? <br>
LON: No, mother, I hadn't forgotten. <br>
TANHA: Well, then. We must make the effort. <br>
LON: Must we? <br>
TANHA: Well of course we must. <br>
LON: Why? <br>
TANHA: It is expected of us. You are the Federator's son. Come, Lon.
What's wrong? <br>
LON: The Federator's son is bored. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Now then, Tegan, where are we? <br>
TEGAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Very simple question, where are we? <br>
TEGAN: Well, aren't we on Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: No, we're not. So? <br>
TEGAN: Well how should I know? <br>
DOCTOR: Think! <br>
NYSSA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Please, Tegan, think. Reach into the back of your mind. <br>
TEGAN: Are we on Manussa? <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
TEGAN: Are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. <br>
TEGAN: How did I know that? <br>
DOCTOR: Manussa, formerly homeworld of the Sumaran Empire which may or
may not ring a bell. Does it, Tegan? The Sumaran Empire? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Federator's residence]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TANHA: I agree Ambril can be rather trying. On the
whole, you know, I preferred his predecessor. Now what was the man's
name? Oh, he was completely dotty, but much more fun. <br>
LON: It's not just Ambril, mother, it's all of it. The ceremony and
everything. It's all such nonsense, isn't it. <br>
TANHA: Is it? <br>
LON: Of course it is. And all so long ago. The Mara was destroyed five
hundred years ago and yet we're still celebrating it. Why? <br>
TANHA: Oh, once every ten years. <br>
LON: It occurs to me that the whole thing is kept going solely to
remind the people here how much better life is under the rule of the
Federation. <br>
TANHA: And so it is. <br>
LON: Is it? <br>
TANHA: Of course it is. Life under the Mara must have been gruesome in
the extreme. I mean, look. <br>
(She takes the snake statuette from Lon.) <br>
TANHA: Oh, it is grotesque. You ought to take more interest in our
heritage. <br>
LON: Why? <br>
TANHA: Well, it's the root of our culture. The Legend of the Return.
Although, now what was the man's name? Well, the Director before
Ambril, he didn't think it was just a legend. He thought the Mara
really would return. <br>
LON: Am I now supposed to take the ramblings of a mad man seriously? <br>
TANHA: He didn't ramble. <br>
LON: The Mara was destroyed, not banished to another dimension. It
won't return in a dream or in any other form. <br>
TANHA: If you say so. <br>
LON: I think I just have. <br>
TANHA: Well, it made a good story. Quite made my hair stand on end.
Ambril's predecessor was rather good value, even if he was talking
nonsense. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NYSSA: Is this necessary? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. We must recover Tegan's dream, and simple hypnosis is the
quickest way. <br>
NYSSA: But why must we? <br>
DOCTOR: Dreams are important, Nyssa. Never underestimate them. Once a
man fell asleep, dreamt he was a frog. When he woke up he didn't know
if he was a man who dreamt he was a frog, or a frog who was now
dreaming he was a man. <br>
TEGAN: I'm still possessed, aren't I, Doctor. The Mara from the world
of the Kinda is still inside my head somewhere, isn't it. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll have to see. <br>
TEGAN: But you think so. <br>
DOCTOR: It does seem likely. I'm sorry. <br>
TEGAN: But where? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, obviously below the threshold of conscious thought. I
would imagine that when awake your mind is still strong enough to
resist, but in sleep it loosens its grip and battle is joined. <br>
TEGAN: In my dreams? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
TEGAN: The battle for what? <br>
DOCTOR: For control. Come over here. <br>
NYSSA: That's why you misread the coordinates. <br>
DOCTOR: It's possible the Mara seized temporary control and brought
itself home. Now, insert the earpiece, try to relax, and when switched
on, listen to the sound. <br>
(Tegan puts the box on a wire around her neck and puts in the
earpiece.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Federator's residence]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TANHA: He thought the only people who knew the
truth about the Mara were the Snake Dancers. Once he even took us to
visit them. It was miles from anywhere, way up in the hills. It was all
wildly unofficial. We had to go in disguise. Can you imagine your
father in disguise? Even then. <br>
LON: And did they? <br>
TANHA: What? <br>
LON: Know the truth about the Mara. <br>
TANHA: It was so dark and they were so dirty, it was difficult to tell.
Oh, they were frightful. They were all covered in ash. Some of them
were almost naked. They lived entirely on roots and berries and things,
and they put themselves into trances. It was quite disgusting. They
handled live snakes, I remember. <br>
LON: Why? <br>
TANHA: Something to do with their religion. <br>
LON: What did father think? <br>
TANHA: The Federator, as usual, was not amused. <br>
(There is a knock at the door.) <br>
TANHA: Come in. <br>
(A servitor in a short cape shows in a man in mostly Cossack clothing.)
<br>
AMBRIL: Good morning, my Lady Tanha. <br>
TANHA: Good morning. <br>
AMBRIL: Are we ready? <br>
TANHA: I'm afraid not quite. <br>
AMBRIL: I beg your pardon. In that case, I'll <br>
TANHA: No, no, no, no. Please stay. My son can dress quite quickly. <br>
LON: What's this? <br>
AMBRIL: That, my Lord, is a small token in honour of your presence here
deputising for your father. I trust you approve? <br>
TANHA: Thank you. <br>
AMBRIL: Exquisite, isn't it? <br>
LON: Is it a fake? <br>
AMBRIL: Oh no, my Lord, it's an original. One of a pair from my
collection. Seven hundred years old from the middle Sumaran era. I
unearthed it myself. <br>
LON: Did you really? <br>
AMBRIL: Yes, my Lord. <br>
LON: Oh. Here, then. Catch. <br>
(Lon doesn't really throw the statuette at Ambril.) <br>
AMBRIL: Oh, my Lord. <br>
(Lon finally gets up to leave, and tosses the statuette at Ambril, who
fortunately catches it.) </font></p>

TEGAN: On Deva Loka, the Kinda world. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing there? <br>
TEGAN: It's horrible. Is that thing inside my head? You must know I
climbed a tree and dropped apples on its head. No. I will never agree
to what you ask. Doctor? Am I free of the Mara now? Forever? Am I? <br>
DOCTOR: You must go deeper, Tegan. Much deeper. Where are you now? <br>
TEGAN: I'm in my garden, silly. Everything grows in my garden. People
always come back. I close my eyes, I want them to come back and they
do. It always works. I can tell lies too. People don't always notice so
I'm safe here. <br>
DOCTOR: How old are you? <br>
TEGAN: I'm six, silly. <br>
DOCTOR: Tegan, now you must leave your garden. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, why? <br>
DOCTOR: And go still deeper. Deeper and further. Much further. Can you
hear me? Now, I want you to go into the dream. <br>
TEGAN: No. <br>

I invite you to take the most exciting journey of all. The voyage

NYSSA: That voice, what was it? <br>
DOCTOR: The Mara, speaking through Tegan's mouth. <br>
NYSSA: On Deva Loka you said a physical change took place when
possessed by a Mara. <br>
DOCTOR: It does, as mental resistance weakens. But this time I can
prevent it. <br>
NYSSA: How? <br>
DOCTOR: With this. It inhibits the production of brainwaves associated
with dreaming. <br>

course, academic interpretations as to its precise meaning do differ,
but by paying scrupulous attention to detail and not allowing our
imaginations to run away with us, we can form the glimmerings of an
idea as to what the pictograms may mean. <br>

AMBRIL: The Legend of the Return is nonsense. Pure superstitious
nonsense, invented by the people simply to give themselves something

us here, to this world, without ever having been here before. Now why
should she do that? Why here, why now? Then I used hypnosis to
establish the presence of the Mara in her head. You see, she has a
recurring dream <br>

over her head.) <br>
AMBRIL: All right, all right, humour him, Chela. But remember, there
are no actual facts to impede the full flow of the imagination. <br>
CHELA: The Legend tells that the Mara was not destroyed by the founders
of the Federation, but only banished. <br>
DOCTOR: To the Dark Places of the Inside. <br>
CHELA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry. Do go on. <br>
CHELA: Anyway, according to the Legend, the Mara will return in a

DOCTOR: What does it want? <br>
CHELA: It returns to regain its power over men, when the minds meet
again in the Great Crystal. <br>
DOCTOR: The Great Crystal? <br>
AMBRIL: That's enough. <br>
DOCTOR: How can minds meet? <br>
AMBRIL: How indeed. Wishy mystical mumbo-jumbo. <br>
CHELA: What about the Snake Dancers? <br>
AMBRIL: It appeals to a certain type of mind. Primitive, lazy,
uneducated type of mind. Even my assistant here isn't immune. You'll
find that the Legend becomes more and more vague the closer it
approaches anything resembling any factual detail. </font></p>

there can be no doubt. The reference is to the Six Faces of Delusion.
Now count. One, two, three, four, five. You will observe there are five
faces, not six as the Legend would have it. Now, my point is this. I do

MAN: My Lord, you must not touch it. Not yet. <br>
LON: Why mustn't I? <br>
MAN: The crystal of knowledge has hidden depths. <br>
LON: What do you mean, hidden depths. Where are they? Show them to me.
It's just a fake. Your whole ceremony is a fake. <br>
(Lon takes the crystal from the snake's mouth.) <br>
LON: It's nothing. It's just glass. <br>
(Lon smashes the crystal on the floor.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cave]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The guard moves forward.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. Hurry up. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chamber of the Mara]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LON: A childish fake at the centre of a farce
created by a civilisation that has gone soft. Today I bring real
knowledge. Real knowledge and real power. Give it to me. <br>
AMBRIL: My Lord, I really do think <br>
LON: Give me the Great Crystal. <br>
TANHA: Lon, no, please. What is wrong with you? <br>
LON: Mother, let go. <br>
(Lon removes the right gauntlet to reveal the snake on his arm.) <br>
TANHA: What is that? <br>
LON: Now, give me the Great Crystal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cave]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The guard draws his sword and approaches the
Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now! <br>
(Nyssa and Chela grab the guard and knock him out.) <br>
DOCTOR: You left that a bit late. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chamber of the Mara]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Lon goes up to the wall sculpture.) <br>
LON: Now listen to me, all of you. I hold in my hands the Great
Crystal. The Great Crystal that was removed from its socket by my
ancestor, when the Mara was banished to the dark places of the inside.
Now, after five hundred years, the Mara has returned. It's fitting that
it should be I who restores the Great Crystal to its rightful owner. <br>
(Lon opens the secret doorway and Tegan comes out, holding the snake.) <br>
TEGAN: Go on, do it now. <br>
DOCTOR: No! No! <br>
(Too late. Lon inserts the Crystal, and energy lines stream out towards
Tegan. A noise fills the chamber and the audience grab their heads in
pain. All except the Doctor. Tegan comes down the steps and puts the
snake on the floor where it grows.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! No more, you must not look! The Mara is feeding off the
fear and panic. It needs it. You must not believe what you see. The
Great Crystal is absorbing the belief and creating the Mara. Don't
look! Reach inside yourselves and find the still point. Oh Nyssa,
Nyssa. <br>
(The Doctor stares into his crystal. The giant snake appears to absorb
Tegan, so that just her face is visible in its gaping jaws.) <br>
TEGAN: What is happening? Who dares to interrupt the Becoming? Who does
not believe? Submit. All minds must submit. Look at me. You must look
at me. You cannot resist. It is impossible. No! Stop him! He must be
stopped. Help me, Doctor. What's happening to me? Please, look at me,
Doctor. I need your help. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I will not submit. <br>
(Dojjen's face appears in his crystal.) <br>
TEGAN: No! The crystal! Destroy the crystal! It will prevent my <br>
(The Hawker grabs at the Doctor's crystal. There is a hissing sound, he
screams and falls. Lon tries, and his hand is burnt too.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(The Doctor runs up the steps and pulls the Great Crystal from its
socket. The Mara screams. The snake shrinks and dissolves. Tegan
collapses. The crowd are freed from its influence. Dojjen walks away
from the ruins. The Doctor goes and sits next to Tegan, who is back to
her old Aussie self and crying. <br>
TEGAN: It was awful. It was awful. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's all over now. <br>
TEGAN: The feelings of hate and rage. It was terrible. I wanted to
destroy everything. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you're free of it now. <br>
TEGAN: The Mara's gone for ever? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. The Mara has been destroyed. </font> </p>
