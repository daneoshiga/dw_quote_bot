of candles. The rest of the room is also candle-lit and there are arum
lilies in vases by an open coffin. The bald Welsh undertaker lights the
gas lamp then speaks to his client.) <br>
SNEED: Sneed and Company offer their sincerest condolences, sir, in
this most trying hour. <br>
REDPATH: Grandmamma had a good innings, Mister Sneed. She was so full
of life. I can't believe she's gone. <br>
SNEED: Not gone, Mister Redpath, sir. Merely sleeping. <br>
REDPATH: May I have a moment? <br>
SNEED: Yes, of course. I shall be in the next room, should you require
anything. <br>
(Sneed leaves. The man gazes down the corpse of his mother. Her skin
turns blue for a moment then her eyes open. She grabs her son by the
throat and knocks over a vase. The crash brings Sneed back in.) <br>
SNEED: Oh, no. No.<br>
(Sneed frees Redpath from the woman's grasp, forces her down and tries
to put the coffin lid on.) <br>
SNEED: Gwyneth! Get down here now! We've got another one! <br>
(The vigorous corpse pushes the lid off, knocking Sneed out, and kicks
her way out of the coffin side. She walks down the snow-covered street,
groaning, and with blue vapour coming from her screaming mouth.)

getting. Now, you've seen the future, let's have a look at the past.
1860. How does 1860 sound? <br>

SNEED: Where've you been? I was shouting. <br>
GWYNETH: I've been in the stables, sir, breaking the ice for old
Sampson. <br>
SNEED: Well, get back in there and harness him up. <br>
GWYNETH: Whatever for, sir? <br>
SNEED: The stiffs are getting lively again. Mister Redpath's
grandmother, she's up and on her feet and out there somewhere on the
streets. We've got to find her. <br>
GWYNETH: Mister Sneed, for shame. How many more times? It's ungodly. <br>
SNEED: Don't look at me like it's my fault. Now, come on, hurry up. She
was eighty six. She can't have got far. <br>
GWYNETH: What about Mister Redpath? Did you deal with him? <br>
SNEED: No. She did. <br>
GWYNETH: That's awful, sir. I know it's not my place, and please,
forgive me for talking out of turn, sir. But this is getting beyond,
now. Something terrible is happening in this house, and we've got to
get help. <br>
SNEED: And we will, as soon as I get that dead old woman locked up and
safe and sound. Now stop prevaricating, girl. Get the hearse ready.
We're going body snatching.

ROSE: Blimey! <br>
DOCTOR: You're telling me. Are you all right? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. I think so. Nothing broken. Did we make it? Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: I did it. Give the man a medal. Earth, Naples, December 24th,
1860. <br>
ROSE: That's so weird. It's Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: All yours. <br>
ROSE: But, it's like, think about it, though. Christmas. 1860. Happens
once, just once and it's gone, it's finished, it'll never happen again.
Except for you. You can go back and see days that are dead and gone a
hundred thousand sunsets ago. No wonder you never stay still. <br>
DOCTOR: Not a bad life. <br>
ROSE: Better with two. Come on, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Hey, where do you think you're going? <br>
ROSE: 1860. <br>
DOCTOR: Go out there dressed like that, you'll start a riot,
Barbarella. There's a wardrobe through there. First left, second right,
third on the left, go straight ahead, under the stairs, past the bins,

GWYNETH: What do you mean? <br>
SNEED: Gwyneth, you know full well. <br>
GWYNETH: No, sir. I can't. <br>

SNEED: Find the old lady or you're dismissed. Now, look inside, girl.
Look deep. Where is she? <br>
GWYNETH: She's lost, sir. She's so alone. Oh, my lord. So many strange
things in her head. <br>
SNEED: But where? <br>
GWYNETH: She's excited about tonight. Before she passed on, she was
going to see him. <br>
SNEED: Who's him? <br>
GWYNETH: The great man. All the way from London. The great, great man.

MAN: Did no one travel with you, sir? No lady wife waiting out front? <br>
DICKENS: I'm afraid not. <br>
MAN: You can have mine if you want. <br>
DICKENS: Oh, I wouldn't dare. I've been rather, let's say, clumsy, with
family matters. Thank God I'm too old to cause any more trouble. <br>
MAN: You speak as though it's all over, sir. <br>
DICKENS: No, it's never over. On and on I go, the same old show. I'm
like a ghost, condemned to repeat myself for all eternity. <br>
MAN: It's never too late, sir. You can always think up some new turns. <br>
DICKENS: No, I can't. Even my imagination grows stale. I'm an old man.
Perhaps I've thought everything I'll ever think. Still, the lure of the
limelight's as potent as a pipe, what? Eh? On with the motley.

me if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock
of the door, saw in the knocker, without it's undergoing any

Marley's face! It looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look. It looked

Oliver Twist and what's the other one, the one with the ghost? <br>
DICKENS: A Christmas Carol? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, the one with the trains. The Signal Man, that's it.
Terrifying! The best short story ever written. You're a genius. <br>
DRIVER: You want me to get rid of him, sir? <br>
DICKENS: Er, no, I think he can stay. <br>
DOCTOR: Honestly, Charles. Can I call you Charles? I'm such a big fan. <br>
DICKENS: A what? A big what? <br>
DOCTOR: Fan. Number one fan, that's me. <br>
DICKENS: How exactly are you a fan? In what way do you resemble a means
of keeping oneself cool? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it means fanatic, devoted to. Mind you, I've got to say,
that American bit in Martin Chuzzlewit, what's that about? Was that
just padding or what? I mean, it's rubbish, that bit. <br>
DICKENS: I thought you said you were my fan. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, if you can't take criticism. Go on, do the death of
Little Nell, it cracks me up. No, sorry, forget about that. Come on,
faster! <br>
DICKENS: Who exactly is in that hearse? <br>
DOCTOR: My friend. She's only nineteen. It's my fault. She's in my
care, and now she's in danger. <br>
DICKENS: Why are we wasting my time talking about dry old books? This
is much more important. Driver, be swift! The chase is on! <br>

Haunted. But I never had much bother until a few months back, and then

DICKENS: I saw nothing but an illusion. <br>
DOCTOR: If you're going to deny it, don't waste my time. Just shut up.
What about the gas? <br>
SNEED: That's new, sir. Never seen anything like that. <br>
DOCTOR: Means it's getting stronger, the rift's getting wider and
something's sneaking through. <br>
ROSE: What's the rift? <br>
DOCTOR: A weak point in time and space. A connection between this place
and another. That's the cause of ghost stories, most of the time. <br>
SNEED: That's how I got the house so cheap. Stories going back
generations. <br>

fraud. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Charles. All right. I shouldn't have told you to
shut up. I'm sorry. But you've got one of the best minds in the world.
You saw those gas creatures. <br>
DICKENS: I cannot accept that. <br>
DOCTOR: And what does the human body do when it decomposes? It breaks
down and produces gas. Perfect home for these gas things. They can slip
inside and use it as a vehicle, just like your driver and his coach. <br>
DICKENS: Stop it. Can it be that I have the world entirely wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Not wrong. There's just more to learn. <br>
DICKENS: I've always railed against the fantasists. Oh, I loved an
illusion as much as the next man, revelled in them, but that's exactly
what they were, illusions. The real world is something else. I
dedicated myself to that. Injustices, the great social causes. I hoped
that I was a force for good. Now you tell me that the real world is a
realm of spectres and jack-o'-lanterns. In which case, have I wasted my
brief span here, Doctor? Has it all been for nothing?

every Sunday, nice and proper. <br>
ROSE: What, once a week? <br>
GWYNETH: We did sums and everything. To be honest, I hated every
second. <br>
ROSE: Me too. <br>
GWYNETH: Don't tell anyone, but one week, I didn't go and ran on the
heath all on my own. <br>
ROSE: I did plenty of that. I used to go down the shops with my mate
Shareen. We used to go and look at boys. <br>
GWYNETH: Well, I don't know much about that, miss. <br>
ROSE: Come on, times haven't changed that much. I bet you've done the
same. <br>
GWYNETH: I don't think so, miss. <br>
ROSE: Gwyneth, you can tell me. I bet you've got your eye on someone. <br>
GWYNETH: I suppose. There is one lad. The butcher’s boy. He comes by
every Tuesday. Such a lovely smile on him. <br>
ROSE: I like a nice smile. Good smile, nice bum. <br>
GWYNETH: Well, I have never heard the like. <br>
ROSE: Ask him out. Give him a cup of tea or something, that's a start. <br>
GWYNETH: I swear it is the strangest thing, miss. You've got all the
clothes and the breeding, but you talk like some sort of wild thing. <br>
ROSE: Maybe I am. Maybe that's a good thing. You need a bit more in
your life than Mister Sneed. <br>
GWYNETH: Oh, now that's not fair. He's not so bad, old Sneed. He was
very kind to me to take me in because I lost my mum and dad to the flu
when I was twelve. <br>
ROSE: Oh, I'm sorry. <br>
GWYNETH: Thank you, miss. But I'll be with them again, one day, sitting
with them in paradise. I shall be so blessed. They're waiting for me.
Maybe your dad's up there waiting for you too, miss. <br>
ROSE: Maybe. Er, who told you he was dead? <br>
GWYNETH: I don't know. Must have been the Doctor. <br>
ROSE: My father died years back. <br>
GWYNETH: But you've been thinking about him lately more than ever. <br>
ROSE: I suppose so. How do you know all this? <br>
GWYNETH: Mister Sneed says I think too much. I'm all alone down here. I
bet you've got dozens of servants, haven't you, miss? <br>
ROSE: No, no servants where I'm from. <br>
GWYNETH: And you've come such a long way. <br>
ROSE: What makes you think so? <br>
GWYNETH: You're from London. I've seen London in drawings, but never
like that. All those people rushing about half naked, for shame. And
the noise, and the metal boxes racing past, and the birds in the sky,
no, they're metal as well. Metal birds with people in them. People are
flying. And you, you've flown so far. Further than anyone. The things
you've seen. The darkness, the big bad wolf. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
miss. <br>
ROSE: It's all right. <br>
GWYNETH: I can't help it. Ever since I was a little girl, my mam said I
had the sight. She told me to hide it. <br>
DOCTOR: But it's getting stronger, more powerful, is that right? <br>
GWYNETH: All the time, sir. Every night, voices in my head. <br>
DOCTOR: You grew up on top of the rift. You're part of it. You're the
key. <br>
GWYNETH: I've tried to make sense of it, sir. Consulted with
spiritualists, table rappers, all sorts. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that should help. You can show us what to do. <br>
GWYNETH: What to do where, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: We're going to have a séance.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Living room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Everyone is gathered around a table.) <br>
GWYNETH: This is how Madam Mortlock summons those from the Land of
Mists, down in big town. Come, we must all join hands. <br>
DICKENS: I can't take part in this. <br>
DOCTOR: Humbug? Come on, open mind. <br>
DICKENS: This is precisely the sort of cheap mummery I strive to
unmask. Séances? Nothing but luminous tambourines and a squeeze box
concealed between the knees. This girl knows nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, don't antagonise her. I love a happy medium. <br>
ROSE: I can't believe you just said that. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, we might need you. <br>
(Dickens sits down between Rose and Gwyneth.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good man. Now, Gwyneth, reach out. <br>
GWYNETH: Speak to us. Are you there? Spirits, come. Speak to us that we
may relieve your burden. <br>
(The whispering starts.) <br>
ROSE: Can you hear that? <br>
DICKENS: Nothing can happen. This is sheer folly. <br>
ROSE: Look at her. <br>
GWYNETH: I see them. I feel them. <br>
(Gas tendrils drift above their heads.) <br>
ROSE: What's it saying? <br>
DOCTOR: They can't get through the rift. Gwyneth, it's not controlling
you, you're controlling it. Now, look deep. Allow them through. <br>
GWYNETH: I can't! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you can. Just believe it. I have faith in you, Gwyneth.
Make the link. <br>
GWYNETH: Yes. <br>
(Blue outlines of people appear behind Gwyneth.) <br>
SNEED: Great God! Spirits from the other side. <br>
DOCTOR: The other side of the universe. <br>
(The figures speak with two children's voices, and Gwyneth speaks with
them.) <br>
GELTH: Pity us. Pity the Gelth. There is so little time. Help us. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you want us to do? <br>
GELTH: The rift. Take the girl to the rift. Make the bridge. <br>
DOCTOR: What for? <br>
GELTH: We are so very few. The last of our kind. We face extinction. <br>
DOCTOR: Why, what happened? <br>
GELTH: Once we had a physical form like you, but then the war came. <br>
DICKENS: War? What war? <br>
GELTH: The Time War. The whole universe convulsed. The Time War raged.
Invisible to smaller species but devastating to higher forms. Our
bodies wasted away. We're trapped in this gaseous state. <br>
DOCTOR: So that's why you need the corpses. <br>
GELTH: We want to stand tall, to feel the sunlight, to live again. We
need a physical form, and your dead are abandoned. They're going to
waste. Give them to us. <br>
ROSE: But we can't. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
ROSE: It's not. I mean, it's not <br>
DOCTOR: Not decent? Not polite? It could save their lives. <br>
GELTH: Open the rift. Let the Gelth through. We're dying. Help us. Pity
the Gelth. <br>
(The Gelth go back into the gas lamps and Gwyneth collapses across the
table.) <br>
ROSE: Gwyneth? <br>
DICKENS: All true. <br>
ROSE: Are you okay? <br>
DICKENS: It's all true. <br>
(A little later, Gwyneth has been laid on the chaise longue.) <br>
ROSE: It's all right. You just sleep. <br>
GWYNETH: But my angels, miss. They came, didn't they? They need me? <br>
DOCTOR: They do need you, Gwyneth. You're they're only chance of
survival. <br>
ROSE: I've told you, leave her alone. She's exhausted and she's not
fighting your battles. Drink this. <br>
SNEED: Well, what did you say, Doctor? Explain it again. What are they?
<br>
DOCTOR: Aliens. <br>
SNEED: Like foreigners, you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Pretty foreign, yeah. From up there. <br>
SNEED: Brecon? <br>
DOCTOR: Close. And they've been trying to get through from Brecon to
Cardiff but the road's blocked. Only a few can get through and even
then they're weak. They can only test drive the bodies for so long,
then they have to revert to gas and hide in the pipes. <br>
DICKENS: Which is why they need the girl. <br>
ROSE: They're not having her. <br>
DOCTOR: But she can help. Living on the rift, she's become part of it.
She can open it up, make a bridge and let them through. <br>
DICKENS: Incredible. Ghosts that are not ghosts but beings from another
world, who can only exist in our world by inhabiting cadavers. <br>
DOCTOR: Good system. It might work. <br>
ROSE: You can't let them run around inside of dead people. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? It's like recycling. <br>
ROSE: Seriously though, you can't. <br>
DOCTOR: Seriously though, I can. <br>
ROSE: It's just wrong. Those bodies were living people. We should
respect them even in death. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you carry a donor card? <br>
ROSE: That's different. That's <br>
DOCTOR: It is different, yeah. It's a different morality. Get used to
it or go home. You heard what they said, time's short. I can't worry
about a few corpses when the last of the Gelth could be dying. <br>
ROSE: I don't care. They're not using her. <br>
GWYNETH: Don't I get a say, miss? <br>
ROSE: Look, you don't understand what's going on. <br>
GWYNETH: You would say that, miss, because that's very clear inside
your head, that you think I'm stupid. <br>
ROSE: That's not fair. <br>
GWYNETH: It's true, though. Things might be very different where you're
from, but here and now, I know my own mind, and the angels need me.
Doctor, what do I have to do? <br>
DOCTOR: You don't have to do anything. <br>
GWYNETH: They've been singing to me since I was a child, sent by my mam
on a holy mission. So tell me. <br>
DOCTOR: We need to find the rift. This house is on a weak spot, so
there must be a spot that's weaker than any other. Mister Sneed, what's
the weakest part of this house? The place where most of the ghosts have
been seen? <br>
SNEED: That would be the morgue. <br>
ROSE: No chance you were going to say gazebo, is there?

under white sheets.) <br>
DOCTOR: Urgh. Talk about Bleak House. <br>
ROSE: The thing is, Doctor, the Gelth don't succeed, 'cos I know they
don't. I know for a fact there weren't corpses walking around in 1869. <br>
DOCTOR: Time's in flux, changing every second. Your cozy little world
can be rewritten like that. Nothing is safe. Remember that. Nothing. <br>
DICKENS: Doctor, I think the room is getting colder. <br>
ROSE: Here they come. <br>
(A Gelth comes out of a gas lamp by the door and stands under a stone
archway.) <br>
GELTH: You've come to help. Praise the Doctor. Praise him. <br>
ROSE: Promise you won't hurt her. <br>
GELTH: Hurry! Please, so little time. Pity the Gelth. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll take you somewhere else after the transfer. Somewhere you
can build proper bodies. This isn't a permanent solution, all right? <br>
GWYNETH: My angels. I can help them live. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, where's the weak point? <br>
GELTH: Here, beneath the arch. <br>
GWYNETH: Beneath the arch. <br>
(Gwyneth stands under the arch, inside the Gelth.) <br>
ROSE: You don't have to do this. <br>
GWYNETH: My angels. <br>
GELTH: Establish the bridge. Reach out to the void. Let us through! <br>
GWYNETH: Yes, I can see you. I can see you. Come! <br>
GELTH: Bridgehead establishing. <br>
GWYNETH: Come to me. Come to this world, poor lost souls! <br>
GELTH: It is begun. The bridge is made. <br>
(Gwyneth opens her mouth, and blue gas comes out.) <br>
GELTH: She has given herself to the Gelth. The bridge is open. We
descend. <br>
(The sweet blue apparition turns flame red with sharp teeth. It's voice
deepens and hardens.) <br>
GELTH: The Gelth will come through in force. <br>
DICKENS: You said that you were few in number. <br>
GELTH: A few billion. And all of us in need of corpses. <br>
(The dead get up.) <br>
SNEED: Gwyneth, stop this. Listen to your master. This has gone far
enough. Stop dabbling, child, and leave these things alone, I beg of
you <br>
ROSE: Mister Sneed, get back! <br>
(A corpse grabs Sneed and snaps his neck. A Gelth zooms into his
mouth.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's gone a little bit wrong. <br>
SNEED: I have joined the legions of the Gelth. Come, march with us. <br>
DICKENS: No. <br>
GELTH: We need bodies. All of you. Dead. The human race. Dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Gwyneth, stop them! Send them back now! <br>
GELTH: Three more bodies. Convert them. Make them vessels for the
Gelth. <br>
(Dead Sneed backs Rose and the Doctor up against a metal gate.) <br>
DICKENS: Doctor, I can't. I'm sorry. This new world of yours is too
much for me. I'm so <br>
(The Doctor and Rose hide behind the metal gate, where the corpses
cannot reach them.) <br>
GELTH: Give yourself to glory. Sacrifice your lives for the Gelth. <br>
DOCTOR: I trusted you. I pitied you! <br>
GELTH: We don't want your pity. We want this world and all it's flesh. <br>
DOCTOR: Not while I'm alive. <br>
GELTH: Then live no more. <br>
(Dickens runs out of the house, but blue gas seeps out round the door.
He runs down the street, chased by a Gelph.) <br>
ROSE: But I can't die. Tell me I can't. I haven't even been born yet.
It's impossible for me to die. Isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: But it's 1869. How can I die now? <br>
DOCTOR: Time isn't a straight line. It can twist into any shape. You
can be born in the twentieth century and die in the nineteenth and it's
all my fault. I brought you here. <br>
ROSE: It's not your fault. I wanted to come. <br>
DOCTOR: What about me? I saw the fall of Troy, World War Five. I pushed
boxes at the Boston Tea Party. Now I'm going to die in a dungeon in
Cardiff. <br>
ROSE: It's not just dying. We'll become one of them. <br>
(Dickens runs back into Sneed's house and turns the gas lamps off then
on again. He holds a handkerchief to his mouth to try and stop himself
choking on the unlit town gas as he goes.) <br>
ROSE: We'll go down fighting, yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
ROSE: Together? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>

DOCTOR: I'm so glad I met you. <br>
ROSE: Me too. <br>

DICKENS: Doctor! Doctor! Turn off the flame, turn up the gas! Now, fill
the room, all of it, now! <br>
DOCTOR: What're you doing? <br>
DICKENS: Turn it all on. Flood the place! <br>
DOCTOR: Brilliant. Gas. <br>
ROSE: What, so we choke to death instead? <br>
DICKENS: Am I correct, Doctor? These creatures are gaseous. <br>
DOCTOR: Fill the room with gas, it'll draw them out of the host. Suck
them into the air like poison from a wound! <br>
(The corpses leave the Doctor and Rose, and start shambling towards
Dickens.) <br>
DICKENS: I hope, oh Lord, I hope that this theory will be validated
soon, if not immediately. <br>
DOCTOR: Plenty more! <br>

corpses.) <br>
DICKENS: It's working. <br>
(The Doctor and Rose come out of the alcove.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gwyneth, send them back. They lied. They're not angels. <br>
GWYNETH: Liars? <br>
DOCTOR: Look at me. If your mother and father could look down and see
this, they'd tell you the same. They'd give you the strength. Now send
them back! <br>
ROSE: I can't breathe. <br>
DOCTOR: Charles, get her out. <br>
ROSE: I'm not leaving her. <br>
GWYNETH: They're too strong. <br>
DOCTOR: Remember that world you saw? Rose's world? All those people.
None of it will exist unless you send them back through the rift. <br>
GWYNETH: I can't send them back. But I can hold them. Hold them in this
place, hold them here. Get out. <br>

go into my, er, shed. Won't be long. <br>

Christmas with my family and make amends to them. After all I've
learned tonight, there can be nothing more vital. <br>

DICKENS: Exceedingly! This morning, I thought I knew everything in the
world. Now I know I've just started. All these huge and wonderful
notions, Doctor. I'm inspired. I must write about them. <br>
ROSE: Do you think that's wise? <br>
DICKENS: I shall be subtle at first. The Mystery of Edwin Drood still
lacks an ending. Perhaps the killer was not the boy's uncle. Perhaps he
was not of this Earth. The Mystery of Edwin Drood and the Blue
Elementals. I can spread the word, tell the truth. <br>

But after all these revelations, there's one mystery you still haven't
explained. Answer me this. Who are you? <br>
