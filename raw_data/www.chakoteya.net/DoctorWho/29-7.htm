about a signal again. <br>

anywhere in space and time on my mobile? <br>

On the other side, it is labelled Area 30. Two men and a woman come
running towards them.) <br>
RILEY: (a young man) Oi, you two! <br>
McDONNELL: (a woman) Get out of there! <br>
RILEY: Seal that door, now! <br>
McDONNELL: Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? <br>
RILEY: Are you police? <br>
DOCTOR: Why would we be police? <br>
MARTHA: We got your distress signal. <br>
DOCTOR: If this is a ship, why can't I hear any engines? <br>
McDONNELL: It went dead four minutes ago. <br>
SCANNELL: So maybe we should stop chatting and get to Engineering.
Captain. <br>
COMPUTER: Secure closure active. <br>
McDONNELL: What? <br>
SCANNELL: The ship's gone mad. <br>
(Another woman comes running towards them, bulkheads slamming shut
behind her.) <br>
ERINA: : Who activated secure closure? I nearly got locked in to area
twenty seven. <br>

ERINA: Who are you? <br>
MARTHA: He's the Doctor and I'm Martha. Hello. <br>
COMPUTER: Impact projection forty two minutes twenty seven seconds. <br>
McDONNELL: We'll get out of this. I promise. <br>

MARTHA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Forty two minutes until what? <br>
MARTHA: Doctor! Look. <br>
McDONNELL: Forty two minutes until we crash into the sun. <br>

massive yellow fusion reactor.) <br>
DOCTOR: How many crew members on board? <br>
McDONNELL: Seven, including us. <br>
SCANNELL: We transport cargo across the galaxy. Everything's automated.
We just keep the ship spaceworthy. <br>
DOCTOR: Call the others, I'll get you out. <br>

RILEY: What's he doing? <br>
McDONNELL: No, don't! <br>

Erina puts on a
welder's mask and shuts it again.) <br>
DOCTOR: But my ship's in there! <br>
RILEY: In the vent chamber? <br>
DOCTOR: It's our lifeboat. <br>
SCANNELL: It's lava. <br>
ERINA: The temperature's going mad in there. Up three thousand degrees
in ten seconds, and still rising. <br>
RILEY: Channelling the air. The closer we get to the sun, the hotter
that room's
going to get. <br>
MARTHA: We're stuck here. <br>
DOCTOR: So, we fix the engines, we steer the ship away from the sun.
Simple. Engineering down here, is it? <br>

a mess? <br>
McDONNELL: Oh, my God. <br>
SCANNELL: What the hell happened? <br>
(The engine is a collection of bits and pieces.) <br>
RILEY: Oh, it's wrecked. <br>
DOCTOR: Pretty efficiently too. Someone knew what they were doing. <br>
McDONNELL: Where's Korwin? Has anyone heard from him or Ashton? <br>
SCANNELL: No. <br>
MARTHA: You mean someone did this on purpose? <br>
(Kath McDonnell goes to the intercom.) <br>
McDONNELL: Korwin, Ashton? Where are you? Korwin, can you answer? Where
the hell is he? He should be up here. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, we're in the Torajii system. Lovely. You're a long way from
home, Martha. Half a universe away. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah. Feels it. <br>
DOCTOR: And you're still using energy scoops for fusion? Hasn't that
been outlawed yet? <br>
McDONNELL: We're due to upgrade next docking. Scannell, engine report. <br>
SCANNELL: No response. <br>
McDONNELL: What? <br>
SCANNELL: They're burnt out. The controls are wrecked. I can't get them
back online. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Auxiliary engines. Every craft's got auxiliaries. <br>
McDONNELL: We don't have access from here. The auxiliary controls are
in the front of the ship. <br>
SCANNELL: Yeah, with twenty nine password sealed doors between us and
them. You'll never get there in time. <br>
MARTHA: Can't you override the doors? <br>
SCANNELL: No. Sealed closure means what it says. They're all dead-lock
sealed. <br>
DOCTOR: So a sonic screwdriver's no use. <br>
SCANNELL: Nothing's any use. We've got no engines, no time, and no
chance. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, listen to you. Defeated before you've even started. Where's
your Dunkirk spirit? Who's got the door passwords? <br>
RILEY: They're randomly generated. Reckon I know most of them. Sorry.
Riley Vashti. <br>
DOCTOR: Then what're you waiting for, Riley Vashti? Get on it. <br>
RILEY: Well, it's a two person job. One, a technish for the questions,
and the other to carry this. The oldest and cheapest security system
around, eh, Captain? <br>
McDONNELL: Reliable and simple, just like you, eh, Riley? <br>
(Riley puts a massive backpack on. It contains a portable computer and
a keyboard.) <br>
RILEY: Try and be helpful, get abuse. Nice. <br>
MARTHA: I'll help you. Make myself useful. <br>
RILEY: It's remotely controlled by the computer panel. That's why it
needs two. <br>
DOCTOR: Oi. Be careful. <br>
MARTHA: You too. <br>
ASHTON [OC]: McDonnell. It's Ashton. <br>
McDONNELL: Where are you? Is Korwin with you? <br>
ASHTON [OC]: Get up to the med-centre now! <br>

McDONNELL: Korwin! What's happened? Is he okay? <br>
KORWIN: Help me! It's burning me! <br>
DOCTOR: How long's he been like this? <br>

McDONNELL: What are you doing?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Don't get too close. <br>
McDONNELL: Don't be so stupid. That's my husband. <br>
ASHTON: And he's just sabotaged our ship. <br>
McDONNELL: What? <br>
ASHTON: He went mad. He put the ship onto secure closure, then he set
the heat pulse to melt the controls. <br>
McDONNELL: No way. He wouldn't do that. <br>
ASHTON: I saw it happen, Captain. <br>
DOCTOR: Korwin? Korwin, open your eyes for me a second. <br>
KORWIN: I can't! <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, course you can. Go on. <br>
KORWIN: Don't make me look at you, please. <br>
(The Doctor takes a hypo-gun from a medical tray.) <br>
DOCTOR: All right, all right, all right. Just relax. Sedative? <br>
ABI: Yes. <br>
(The Doctor sedates Korwin.) <br>
McDONNELL: What's wrong with him? <br>
DOCTOR: Rising body temperature, unusual energy readings. Stasis
chamber. I do love a good stasis chamber. Keep him sedated in there.
Regulate the body temperature. And, just for fun, run a bioscan and
tissue profile on a metabolic detail. <br>
ABI: Just doing them now. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you're good. Anyone else presenting these symptoms? <br>
ABI: Not so far. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's something. <br>
McDONNELL: Will someone tell me what is the matter with him? <br>
DOCTOR: Some sort of infection. We'll know more after the test results.
Now, allons-y, back downstairs. Hey. See about those engines. Go. Hey.
Go. <br>

MARTHA: Hurry up, will you? <br>
RILEY: All right. Fix the clamp on. <br>
MARTHA: What are you typing? <br>
RILEY: Each door's trip code is the answer to a random question set by
the crew. Nine tours back, we got drunk, thought them up. Reckoning
was, if we're hijacked, we're the only ones who know all the answers. <br>
MARTHA: So you type in the right answer <br>
RILEY: This sends an unlock pulse to the clamp. But we only get one
chance per door. Get it wrong, the whole system freezes. <br>
MARTHA: Better not get it wrong then. <br>
RILEY: Okay. Date of SS Pentallian's first flight. That's all right.
Go! <br>

MARTHA: I can do it! <br>
DOCTOR: Martha, where are you? <br>
MARTHA: It's all right, I'm here. Just help me get him up. Stasis
chamber, minus two hundred, yeah? <br>
McDONNELL: No, you don't know how this equipment works. You'll kill
him. Nobody can survive those temperatures. <br>
MARTHA: He's not human. If he says he can survive, then he can. <br>
McDONNELL: Let me help you, then. <br>
MARTHA: You've done enough damage. <br>
(The Doctor lies in the stasis chamber.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ten seconds. That's all I'll be able to take. No more. Martha! <br>
MARTHA: Yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: It's burning me up. I can't control it. If you don't get rid of
it, I could kill you. I could kill you all. I'm scared! I'm so scared! <br>
MARTHA: Just stay calm. You saved me, now I return the favour. Just
believe in me. <br>
DOCTOR: It's burning through me. Then what'll happen? <br>
MARTHA: That's enough! I've got you. <br>
DOCTOR: There's this process, this thing that happens if I'm about to
die. <br>
MARTHA: Shush. Quiet now. Because that is not going to happen. Are you
ready? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
(Martha uses the joystick to roll the Doctor completely into the
chamber, then types 200 into the keypad and presses the green button.
The Doctor screams as his body temperature falls.) <br>
COMPUTER: Heat shields failing. At five percent.
(In Engineering, Korwin stands up just as a computer monitor reports -
power drain medcentre stasis chamber active. He goes to a lever, pulls
it up, and the monitor changes to stasis chamber inactive. The power is
cut at minus 70 degrees. The Doctor is covered in frost.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! Martha, you can't stop it. Not yet. <br>
MARTHA: What happened? <br>
McDONNELL: Power's been cut in Engineering. <br>
MARTHA: But who's down there? <br>
