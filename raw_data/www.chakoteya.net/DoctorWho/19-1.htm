<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is lying on the ground after falling
from the antenna. He is badly injured.) <br>
NYSSA: Doctor. <br>
TEGAN: Doctor. <br>
ADRIC: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: It's the end. But the moment has been prepared for. <br>
(The Doctor points to a ghostly white figure, that walks forward.) <br>
ADRIC: The Watcher. <br>
(The Watcher merges with the Doctor.) <br>
NYSSA: So he was the Doctor all the time. <br>
(Tom Baker turns into the Watcher, then gains the youthful features and
short straight hair of Peter Davison. Roll the opening titles.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan and Adric help the Doctor across the fields
while Nyssa runs after them. An alarm is blaring. They nearly get to
the Tardis when the Doctor falls into the long grass.) <br>
DOCTOR: I. Oh. <br>
SECURITY: These are secure premises! Now you lot have got some
explaining to do. <br>
TEGAN: But the Doctor <br>
SECURITY: He'll be taken care of. <br>
(Two guards grab the young people and haul them away.) <br>
ADRIC: Look, will you let me go! <br>
TEGAN: Look, take your hands off me. This is an official uniform! <br>
NYSSA: Leave me alone! <br>
ADRIC: Now, don't be silly. We would like to help you, but we can't
just leave the Doctor. Something might've gone wrong with his
regeneration. <br>
(An East Sussex Health Authority ambulance pulls up and the driver gets
out.) <br>
SECURITY: Hands up and lean on it. Come on, quick! <br>
(Tegan, Nyssa and Adric are forced to assume the position against the
side of the ambulance so the guards can search them. The ambulance men
run over to the Doctor with a stretcher and blanket.) <br>
GUARD: There you go. <br>
TEGAN: We're perfectly harmless, unfortunately. <br>
(Tegan sees the keys of the ambulance still in the ignition as the
Doctor is carried into the back.) <br>
ADRIC: I thought the whole point of this Pharos Project of yours was to
track down alien intelligences. We thought we'd save you the trouble
and come to you. <br>
SECURITY: Oh yes? <br>
ADRIC: Yes. We're what you've been looking for. Alien intelligences.
You see I come from somewhere up there. That is the way into E-space. <br>

trying to hold him down.) </font></p>

carry the Doctor inside just in time.)

about these controls. <br>
(Behind their backs, the Doctor rushes to the interior door.) <br>
TEGAN: We can't take off without Adric. Doctor! Where's he off to now? <br>
(Tegan goes after the Doctor while Nyssa turns on the scanner to check
on Adric. He's still held firmly by the nasty Head of Security.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SECURITY: Right, young man, you better come along
with me. <br>
ADRIC: Look, I hope you realise the Doctor's just saved us all from the
Master, and now he's going to take off and you'll never have a chance

laughs at the situation.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NYSSA: Tegan! <br>
TEGAN: What's the matter? <br>
NYSSA: The Master's Tardis. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Adric! Adric, where are you? <br>
(The column dematerialises, revealing Adric on his knees. The girls run
over and help him up, then they go back into the Tardis. They don't
notice the column hanging in mid-air nearby.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: I suppose we'd better take off or
something. <br>
(Adric works the controls.) <br>
TEGAN: I hope he knows what he's doing. <br>
NYSSA: He took off once before, he said, but that was by mistake. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises, followed by the column. The Master is still
laughing. Nyssa watches the Earth getting smaller on the scanner.) <br>
NYSSA: Good takeoff. <br>
(Tegan enters.) <br>
TEGAN: The Doctor's very strange. <br>
NYSSA: He's weak. It's the shock. <br>
TEGAN: Well, you'd better go talk to him, because I don't understand
this scientific stuff. He's looking for something called a Zero Room. <br>
ADRIC: Zero Room? I'll go. <br>
(Adric leaves.) <br>
TEGAN: That boy never even said thank you.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Adric picks up the red coat, then puts it down.
Just along the corridor is a thread tied to a door handle. He follows
it and finds the Doctor unravelling his scarf.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. You've come to help me find the Zero Room. Welcome aboard.
I'm the Doctor. Or will be if this regeneration works out. <br>
(The Doctor shakes Adric's hand and walks off. Adric follows.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NYSSA: I suppose this is the mean free path
tracker. And this panel must be a referential difference. <br>
TEGAN: I know the Tardis is huge, but it can't be taking them this
long, surely. What's a Zero Room anyway? The Doctor said something
about null interfaces. <br>
NYSSA: I suppose it's some sort of neutral environment. An isolated
space cut off from the rest of the universe. <br>
TEGAN: He should've told me that's what he wanted. I could've shown him
Brisbane.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has almost finished unravelling his
scarf.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, ordinary spaces, of course, show up on the architectural
configuration indicators, but any good Zero Room is balanced to zero
energy with respect to the world outside its four walls. Or however
many walls it has. <br>
(The Doctor starts to run his fingers through his hair, and discovers
that it is short and straight, not curly.) <br>
DOCTOR: There was a very good polygonal Zero Room under the Junior
Senate block on Gallifrey, widely acclaimed for it's healing
properties. Romana's always telling me I need a holiday. <br>
ADRIC: But Romana's gone, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Gone? Really? Did she leave a note? <br>
ADRIC: We said goodbye to her at the gateway. Don't you remember? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if we did, we did. <br>
(He ties the end of the scarf yarn to another door handle.) <br>
DOCTOR: This should get you back to the console room when the time
comes. <br>
ADRIC: Are you sure you're alright? <br>
DOCTOR: There are strong dimensioning forces this deep in the Tardis.
Tend to make one a bit giddy. <br>
ADRIC: And the regeneration? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I can feel it isn't going to be as smooth as on
other occasions. Sooner we get to this Zero Room place, the better, eh?
<br>
(The Doctor puts a shoe down as a marker to find his way back, now he's
out of wool.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NYSSA: These mechanisms are too complex. We just
can't fly the Tardis without the Doctor's help. <br>
TEGAN: What if we don't get it? Anything could've happened to him and
Adric. <br>
NYSSA: Then the Tardis will just fly on and on, until it crashes into
something. <br>
TEGAN: Crash? Is that likely? <br>
NYSSA: Inevitable. The star densities in this galaxy vary inversely
with the square <br>
TEGAN: Oh, rabbits! <br>
NYSSA: Tegan, I don't know what's happening to the Doctor, none of us
understands it but, I do know that panicking is no use. <br>
TEGAN: You're right. Well, if only we had a manual. <br>
NYSSA: There's nothing we can do here. I'm going to try and find them. <br>
TEGAN: Wait! You don't know those corridors. I got lost in them when I
first came into the Tardis and I can tell you they're a nightmare. <br>
NYSSA: Then you'd better stay here. <br>
TEGAN: I'll come with you. <br>
(Tegan takes her shoulder bag off the console.) <br>
TEGAN: Wait a minute! <br>
(She reads a message on a screen.) <br>
TEGAN: Tardis Information System. Ready For Entry. <br>
NYSSA: A databank!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is now tearing up his waistcoat to
leave markers at junctions.) <br>
DOCTOR: I left a waistcoat like that on. Ever been to Alzarius? <br>
ADRIC: I was born there, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? It's a small universe, isn't it. <br>
(The Doctor starts behaving like William Hartnell.) <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder, boy, what would you do if you were me, hmmm? Or
perhaps I should ask, what would I do if I were me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Will it tell us how to fly the Tardis? <br>
NYSSA: I'm sure that's in here somewhere, once we find the index file. <br>
TEGAN: How do we find the index file? Of course, if we had an index
file, we could look it up in the index file, under index file. What am
I saying? I'm talking nonsense. <br>
NYSSA: Recursion isn't nonsense. <br>
TEGAN: Eh? <br>
NYSSA: That's an example of recursion, when procedures fold back on
themselves. If you had an index file, you could look it up in the index
file. <br>
TEGAN: If. My Dad used to say that if was the most powerful word in the
English language. <br>
NYSSA: Recursion's a powerful mathematical concept, but I don't see how
it can help us now. <br>
TEGAN: If. I F! Stands for index file!

DOCTOR: Not far now, Brigadier, if the Ice Warriors don't get there
first. Oh no. Oh dear. We've wandered into the wrong corridor. We must
be close to the main Tardis drive now. Jamie. Jamie, you go back. <br>
ADRIC: No. I have to stay with you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, nonsense, be sensible, go back! When I say run, run! Don't
you understand? The regeneration is failing.

NYSSA: Look up destination setting. <br>
TEGAN: Right. D S. You know, once you get into it, this whole funny
system on the Tardis does start to make a sort of weird sense. Except
this. (reads) Tardis Flight Data. Programmed Journey. Departure Earth,
Pharos Project. Destination Hydrogen In Rush, Event One.

off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Adric! Adric, not that way! Adric. I remembered his name. <br>
(Meanwhile, near the console room, Tegan has found the start of the
yarn.) <br>
TEGAN: Seems the old doc is coming unraveled in more ways than one.
Look, you'd better go back to the console room. <br>
NYSSA: We're on a programmed flight. We won't crash. At least I don't
think so. <br>

(A full cheval mirror with descant recorder on the top, and a hat stand
with panama, green Wellington boots and light beige coat with red trim
on a hangar. The Doctor gazes at his new features.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's the trouble with regeneration. You never quite know what
you're going to get. <br>
(He tries playing the recorder, but blows too hard. It squeaks.) <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
(Then he finds a cricket bat by the hat stand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Dear me. Needs a drop of linseed oil though. <br>
(The Doctor turns and spots a white door nearby. He opens it to reveal
a changing room, complete with cricket bats in a rack, shields on the
wall, a notice board and some whites scattered on a bench and hamper.
The Doctor goes inside and closes the door.)

of the waistcoat.) <br>
TEGAN: No, that looks like the end of the trail. <br>

with Care and some dust sheets.) <br>
NYSSA: This part of the Tardis can't have been used for centuries. <br>

jumper over his shirt and changed into beige striped trousers and
plimsolls. He tries a few batting shots in front of the mirror, then
puts on the coat and panama. He takes the hat off again.) <br>

thud.) <br>

Doctor.)&nbsp;<br>
NYSSA: Doctor! <br>
TEGAN: Thank heavens. <br>
DOCTOR: The Zero Room door, I heard it slam. <br>
TEGAN: Doctor, are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Fit as a fiddle, Vicki, but something very peculiar is going on
in the Tardis. The Zero Room. Have you seen it anywhere? <br>
TEGAN: I think the noise came from this direction. <br>

TEGAN: Actually, Doctor, it's me. My lipstick. We passed this way
before. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh that's a relief, I thought the Tardis auto-systems were
playing up again. Dreadful. Always going wrong. It's time we went to
Logopolis to get it all sorted out once and for all. <br>

DOCTOR: Thank you. You must be Tegan. Works even better if you close
the doors, Nyssa. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. I've never quite understood why. It's quite peaceful,
isn't it. <br>
TEGAN: Peaceful. Doctor it's like <br>
NYSSA: Like Traken used to be. <br>
TEGAN: Will you have to stay here long? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just until my dendrites heal. (taps his head) The nervous
system's a very delicate network of logic junctions. <br>
NYSSA: The synapses, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I was forgetting, Nyssa, bioelectronics is your strong
point. Yes, well, my tussle with the Master came at precisely the wrong
moment. When the synapses are weak they're like radio receivers,
picking up all sorts of jumbled signals. <br>
TEGAN: I get it. The Zero Room cuts out all interference. <br>
DOCTOR: Completely! Even the gravity's only local. Goodness me, I'm
tired. <br>
NYSSA: But there isn't even a bed. <br>
DOCTOR: Bed? Oh, I don't need a bed. Not in the Zero Room. <br>
(The Doctor puts his fingers to his temples, then begins to rotate in
the air until he is lying down.) <br>
DOCTOR: One of the advantages of stark simplicity. <br>
TEGAN: Can anybody do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you don't do it. It just sort of comes to you, like sleep.
Very like sleep. We only just made it to the Zero Room in
time.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR [OC]: This regeneration is going to be difficult, and I shall
need you all, every one of you. You, Tegan, you have it in you to be a
fine coordinator, keeping us all together during the healing time.
Nyssa, of course, has the technical skill and understanding. All the
information you need is in the Tardis databank. I'm sure you can find
your way to it. <br>
TEGAN: We already have, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Good, good. Of course you have. And Adric, Adric with his
badge for mathematical excellence. Adric is the navigator. He knows the
way. He knows me, my old self. Adric, you must help me heal the
disconnection. Your role is very crucial. <br>
TEGAN: Adric. <br>
NYSSA: Oh! Adric! <br>
(One of the giant roundels on the wall shows Adric caught in a web of
wires.) <br>
TEGAN: Adric. What are you doing up there? <br>
ADRIC: A trap. He set a trap. The Master! <br>
NYSSA: The Master? Where? <br>
ADRIC: Me! I'm the trap. I locked the coordinates. Event One! <br>
TEGAN: Adric, hold on. I'm coming up to get you. <br>
ADRIC: No, no, this isn't me. It isn't me. It's an illusion.
Projection! Block transfer. Tegan, the coordinates. <br>

of their own. Almost. <br>
ADRIC: Can't, can't reach me in the Zero Room. <br>
MASTER: Is that what you thought? Well, my dear young man, it's your
own computational powers that made the block transfer possible. If
escape were that easy, Adric, we could all be free of this nasty world.
Now, we must save your energies. There's so much yet to be done. <br>

for the Portreeve to grant two audiences on the same day. <br>

mirror to face outwards through the window. He lies on his bed and
picks up one of the books the girls brought from the library.) <br>

(He finds a loose piece of notepaper inside it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's odd. That's very odd indeed. <br>

puts his head round the door.) <br>

NYSSA: We keep coming back to it. <br>
RUTHER: Of course. <br>
TEGAN: But you must see that there's something going wrong here? <br>
RUTHER: There are, as you have observed, steps that rise from the
square and others that lead downwards from it, while other walks
debouch laterally. An equitable arrangement, surely, allowing for much
variety of movement. <br>
TEGAN: You're not going to tell me you don't realise <br>
RUTHER: Ah, there is an exemplary vista from here. <br>

TEGAN: He must know. They're all in this together. <br>
NYSSA: They would be if they were part of the recursion. <br>
RUTHER: Here. Fine view down into the water tower. <br>
NYSSA: Wait a minute. <br>
(Nyssa takes the telescope and scans the square. She sees Shardovan
entering.) <br>
NYSSA: Look. <br>
TEGAN: What is it? <br>
(The women are using the Zero Cabinet as a washtub.) <br>

DOCTOR: You know, I'm very fond of history, but I don't usually get
much time for reading. <br>

DOCTOR: No! Please. It's backed with silver. Helps to keep it out. <br>
MERGRAVE: It? And what, sir, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely what I'm trying to find out. Tell me, Mergrave, what
do you see out of the window? <br>
MERGRAVE: Well, sir, the town square, the library, the Portreeve's
house and my own pharmacy. In fine, sir, the dwellings of Castrovalva. <br>
DOCTOR: And it all makes sense to you? <br>
MERGRAVE: Strange question. Shardovan has asked the same. <br>
DOCTOR: Shardovan. <br>
(Mergrave pours another dose of his blue tonic into a glass.) <br>
MERGRAVE: He too can be a little fevered in his imaginings. This will
dispel your fatigue. <br>
(The Doctor nearly drinks it.) <br>
DOCTOR: How do I know you're telling the truth? <br>
MERGRAVE: Because, sir, I maintain I am, and I am a man of my word. <br>
DOCTOR: A perfect example of recursion, Mergrave. And recursion is
exactly what we're up against. Draw me a square, large as you can. <br>
(Mergrave takes a piece of chalk from the Doctor and starts to draw on
the back of the mirror. It is a square.) <br>

ensnared. <br>
SHARDOVAN: Ah. They cannot think that. <br>

also. <br>
(Crosses on the outside lines of the map. Oops.) <br>
DOCTOR: Four pharmacies in a small place like this? <br>
MERGRAVE: No, sir. I have but one. <br>
DOCTOR: You positioned it four times. <br>
MERGRAVE: It may be approached, sir, by many different routes. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
(He drinks the tonic.) <br>
DOCTOR: Valeriana officinalis centiculare europea. And just a hint of
rosemary. <br>

whereabouts of the Portreeve's house. <br>
RUTHER: Nothing is more certain, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Well put. Show us on the map. <br>
RUTHER: This is the Portreeve's house, along here, down there, (pause)
round there. <br>
MERGRAVE: The Doctor has been explaining to me. I almost grasp it. <br>
RUTHER: There is something amiss with the map. <br>
DOCTOR: There is something amiss with Castrovalva, but because your
perception is part of it, you cannot see it. <br>
RUTHER: I am a rational man, sir. Explain this interesting idea. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm afraid that would take some doing. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor, the Cabinet. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, in a minute. This library of Shardovan's, are all the
books like this? <br>
NYSSA: Yes, why? <br>
DOCTOR: These volumes chronicle the rise of Castrovalva out of an
alliance of warring hunters twelve hundred years ago. Or purport to
chronicle. <br>
MERGRAVE: Purport, you say? <br>
RUTHER: That, sir, is our official history. <br>
MERGRAVE: From Castrovalva's first beginnings to the present day. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm no expert, but I have the strongest possible
hunch that these are forgeries. <br>
RUTHER: What do you say, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the threads, the bindings, the paper, are as near the real
thing as may be, but the contents are faked. <br>
NYSSA: How can you tell? <br>
DOCTOR: There is something we're all overlooking. <br>
NYSSA: Yes? What, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I'm overlooking it, too. <br>
(He takes the note out of his coat.) <br>
DOCTOR: But I'm certain the whole history's been invented. <br>
TEGAN: By Shardovan. <br>
NYSSA: But why? To hide something? <br>
TEGAN: Something about the real history. Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: If there ever was a real history. <br>

to see you. <br>

SHARDOVAN: Why are all these women here? Is this a holiday? <br>

carrying the front of the Cabinet, with Ruther and another man carrying
the back, followed by the women and Nyssa, with Tegan bringing up the
rear. She cuts across the square to get ahead of them.) <br>
TEGAN: Excuse me. I am responsible for the Doctor. <br>
(Shardovan gives up his corner, and Nyssa comes next to Tegan.) <br>
MERGRAVE: This way. <br>
(The procession carries on, but Shardovan hangs back. A hand beckons to
him from behind a pillar. It's the Doctor.) <br>
TEGAN: The Doctor can't be levitating. He's so heavy. <br>

TEGAN: Then? <br>
NYSSA: (sotto) The history of Castrovalva. <br>

DOCTOR: You're the only man here who could not be persuaded to join the
hunting ritual. <br>
SHARDOVAN: Ah. My natural indolence would not permit it. <br>
DOCTOR: Your intelligence would not permit it. You suspected the whole
tradition was invention from beginning to end and here's the proof.
Your annotations of the histories. <br>
SHARDOVAN: Ah. Mere fancies, sir. Notes for a fiction I had a mind to
write. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. The fiction of Castrovalva. A civilisation evolving out of
tribal warfare into an ideal community. It is a fiction, and the thing
that confirms it <br>
SHARDOVAN: Well, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I know it. It's on the tip. It's on the tip of my mind. The
books are five hundred years old at least, but <br>

there's nothing one cannot achieve. Nothing, Doctor, in this world or
in any other. The tapestry has the power to build and hold in space
whole worlds of matter. <br>

to open the round window from the outside. That image is also on the

last me, Adric's mathematical powers have been put to lively use. <br>

approaching. The hadron power lines are lethal to the touch. <br>

snuffer, and is pulling it towards him.) <br>
