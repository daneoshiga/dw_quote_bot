DOCTOR: Beautiful word, beautiful world. Apalapucia, voted number two
planet in the top ten greatest destinations for the discerning
intergalactic traveller. <br>
RORY: Why couldn't we go to number one? <br>
DOCTOR: It's hideous. Everyone goes to number one. Planet of the coffee
shops. Apalapucia. I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver
colonnades. I give you <br>

DOCTOR: Your phone? <br>
AMY: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Your mobile telephone? I bring you to a paradise planet, two
billion light years from Earth, and you want to update Twitter. <br>
AMY: Sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades. It's a camera phone. <br>
DOCTOR: On the counter, by the DVDs. <br>
AMY: Thank you. <br>
RORY: How do we get in? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Push a button. <br>

HANDBOT: Welcome to the Twostreams facility. Will you be visiting long?

it when it does that. <br>

DOCTOR: As long as it takes.

DOCTOR: Okay, so you can't follow her directly. You know, it's never
simple. Did you hear that, Handbot? She pressed the wrong button,
that's all. We're aliens, we didn't know. <br>
HANDBOT: Statement rejected. Apalapucia is under planet-wide
quarantine. This is a kindness facility for those infected with
Chen Seven. <br>

RORY: Chen Seven, hmm? <br>

DOCTOR: Amy, I'm taking the Time Glass back to the Tardis. Like satnav,
I'll use it to get a lock, then smash through using the Tardis to get
you out. Until then, you're on your own. <br>

RORY: Er, what are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Locking it on to Amy. Small act of vandalism. No one'll mind. <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, that'll be the small act of vandalism alarm. Amy, I need
you to go into the facility just for a bit. Find somewhere safe and
leave me a sign. Remember, you're immune to Chen Seven, but don't let
them give you anything. They don't know you're alien. Their kindness
will kill you. Now go. <br>

RORY: Oh, you can see what I see. <br>

Chen Seven'll kill me, no regeneration. You will be my eyes and ears. <br>
RORY: Rory-cam. Rescue Amy. Got it. <br>
DOCTOR: That's the spirit. Now, smashing through a timewall could get a
bit hairy. <br>
