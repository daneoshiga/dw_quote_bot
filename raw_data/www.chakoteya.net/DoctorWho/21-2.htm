Hampden searches for someone in Bishops Court Farm, Shapwick, Dorset.

JANE: Ben? Ben? Are you there, Ben? <br>
(The horsemen ride in, dressed in Civil War armour. One of them rides
at Jane with his lance pointed at her.) <br>
JANE: Careful! You'll kill somebody. <br>
(He charges her again, and she dodges inside a barn.)<br>JANE: Don't be so stupid. </font></p>

Houston</a> as he takes his helmet off.) <br>
JANE: Ben. Ben, you're mad! <br>
WOLSEY: Nonsense, my dear. Just a bit of fun. <br>
JANE: Fun? <br>
(The other two men enter. One removes his feathered hat and makes a
deep Cavalier bow. Everyone say Hi to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0510317/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dennis Lill</a> making a
return visit in King Charles beard and moustache.) <br>
JANE: Sir George, you must stop these war games. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Stop them? Why, Miss Hampden, you of all people, our school
teacher, should appreciate the value of reenacting actual events. It's
a living history. <br>
JANE: It's getting out of hand. The village is in turmoil. <br>
HUTCHINSON: So there's been a little damage. That's the way people used
to behave in those days. It's a game. You must expect high spirits. <br>
JANE: Not when people can get hurt. It must stop. <br>
HUTCHINSON: And so it shall. We have but one last battle to fight. Join
us. See the merit of what we do. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Turlough is lying on his back underneath the
console.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Is that any better? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, no. No, no, still some time distortion. <br>
TEGAN: Is there a problem? We are going to Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: Date, time and place asked for. How else could you visit your
grandfather? <br>
TURLOUGH: We're nearly there. <br>
DOCTOR: See? <br>
(The Tardis shudders and squeals, then the time rotor resumes its
smooth motion again, and stops.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, we've arrived. <br>
TURLOUGH: We've hit an energy field. <br>
DOCTOR: Unexpected aura for a quiet English village. <br>
(The scanner shows falling masonry.) <br>
TEGAN: Let's get out of here. <br>
TURLOUGH: Quickly, Doctor. Relocate the Tardis. <br>
TEGAN: Hold on! There's somebody out there. <br>
(A person moves amongst the rubble.) <br>
DOCTOR: He's trapped. If there's another fall, he'll be killed. <br>
(The Doctor opens the door and runs out.) <br>
TURLOUGH: We can't go out there! <br>
(Tegan follows the Doctor.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Crypt]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: He's gone. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello? Hello! <br>
(The figure runs for the staircase going up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Wait, please. <br>
TEGAN: Did you see his clothes? We're in the wrong century. <br>
TURLOUGH: We're not. I checked the time monitor. It is 1984. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's have a look around. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Manor house]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A splendid period piece, with tapestries and
panelling, and pewter dishes, and a massive oak table covered in maps,
where Jane is sitting.)<br>
HUTCHINSON: I don't understand you. Every man, woman and child in this
village is involved in these war games except you. Why? It's great fun.
An adventure. <br>
JANE: I understand that. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Then join us. Your influence could temper the more
high-spirited, prevent accidents. <br>
JANE: Look, I don't care if a few high-spirited kids get their heads
banged together. It's gone beyond that. Suppose what happened to me
happens to somebody else, a stranger, a visitor to the village. <br>
HUTCHINSON: There will be no visitors to the village. It's been
isolated from the outside world. No one can enter or leave. <br>
JANE: You can't do that! <br>
HUTCHINSON: Can't I? It's been done. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Church]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The place is disused and dirty. A few pews remain
and there is debris on the altar. The stained glass is intact,
however.) <br>
TEGAN: Where'd he go? <br>
TURLOUGH: Well, if he can move that quickly, he can't be hurt very
badly. <br>
(The Doctor examines the carvings on the pulpit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Interesting. <br>
TEGAN: I don't like it. <br>
DOCTOR: Then admire the craftsmanship. Seventeenth century. Probably on a theme of
a man being chased by the devil. Must admit I've never seen anything
quite like it before. <br>
TEGAN: Looks as though a bomb's hit the place. <br>
TURLOUGH: Maybe it did. <br>
TEGAN: Can we find my grandfather? <br>
(A door creaks.) <br>
TURLOUGH: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: A ghost. <br>
(Fog pours in through a crack in the wall by the pulpit.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the church]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Which is St Bartholomew Shapwick, if you're
interested.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Why'd they build the church so far from the village? <br>
TEGAN: Perhaps they were refused planning permission. <br>
DOCTOR: Behave yourselves. We have company. <br>
(Riders converge on them.) <br>
TURLOUGH: We should go back. <br>
(Foot soldiers are running up behind them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Too late. <br>
WILLOW: Where do you think you're going? This is Sir George
Hutchinson's land. <br>
DOCTOR: If we're trespassing, I apologise. <br>
WILLOW: Little Hodcombe, for your own safety, is a closed area. We're
in the middle of a war game. <br>
TEGAN: We're here to visit my grandfather. <br>
WILLOW: You'd better see Sir George. He'll sort it out. Move out! <br>
(The disfigured man from the crypt watches from behind a gravestone.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Manor house]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor, Turlough and Tegan are pushed into
the panelled room.) <br>
TEGAN: Stop it! Leave me alone! <br>
WOLSEY: What's going on here? <br>
WILLOW: Trespassers, Colonel. I've arrested them. <br>
JANE: I don't believe this. <br>
WOLSEY: Are you sure you should be doing this? <br>
WILLOW: Sir George has been informed. <br>
WOLSEY: I'm sorry about this. Some of the men do get a bit carried
away. We'll soon have the business sorted out and you safely on your
way. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's a very impressive room, Colonel. <br>
WOLSEY: My pride and joy. <br>
DOCTOR: Seventeenth century. <br>
WOLSEY: Yes, perfect in every detail. <br>
TEGAN: What is going on? <br>
JANE: I'm sorry, I don't know. I think everyone's gone mad. <br>
TEGAN: Look, we don't want to interfere. We're just here to visit my
grandfather. <br>
WILLOW: Oh yes? And who might he be? <br>
TEGAN: Andrew Verney. <br>
WILLOW: Verney? <br>
TEGAN: What's wrong? <br>
JANE: He disappeared a few days ago. <br>
TEGAN: Well, has anything been done to find him? <br>
JANE: Ben? <br>
TEGAN: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Now calm down, Tegan. I'm sure we can sort this out. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, for heaven's sake! <br>
(Tegan runs out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Tegan, come back! Turlough, fetch her, will you? <br>
(Joseph Willow picks up a flintlock pistol and aims it at the Doctor as
Turlough rushes out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Please. <br>
WILLOW: You! Stay where you are! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Stable yard]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan stops for breath, and a hand reaches round
a doorway and grabs her red handbag.) <br>
TEGAN: What are you doing? Give me that back! <br>
(Tegan goes inside and starts up the stairs. The door slams shut behind
her.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Manor house]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HUTCHINSON: What's this? <br>
WILLOW: He tried to escape, sir. <br>
HUTCHINSON: He isn't a prisoner, Sergeant Willow. You must treat
visitors with more respect. <br>
(Sir George makes Willow lower his pistol.) <br>
DOCTOR: What is going on? <br>
HUTCHINSON: A celebration. On the thirteenth of July, 1643, the English
Civil War came to Little Hodcombe. A Parliamentary force and a regiment
for the King destroyed each other, and the village. <br>
DOCTOR: And you're celebrating that? <br>
HUTCHINSON: Why not? It's our heritage. <br>
JANE: It's a madness. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Yes. Miss Hampden, you see, disagrees with our activities. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. I can understand why. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm known as the Doctor. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Are you a member of the theatrical profession? <br>
DOCTOR: No more than you are. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Ah. Ha, ha! How did you get to the village? <br>
DOCTOR: Through the woods, via the church. <br>
WILLOW: That's where I found him, sir. <br>
HUTCHINSON: I would avoid the church, if I were you. It's very
dangerous. Could fall down at any minute. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, so I'd noticed. <br>
HUTCHINSON: However, since you're here, you must join in our games.
It's our final battle. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know, I'd love to, but first I must find Tegan and
Turlough, and Tegan's grandfather. I gather he's disappeared. Good day!
<br>
(The Doctor pushes Willow's pistol along the table and runs out.) <br>
HUTCHINSON: Wait, wait, wait. <br>
WILLOW: Tegan is Verney's granddaughter. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Double the perimeter guard. He mustn't get out of the
village. And help him find Verney's granddaughter. <br>
WILLOW: Right. <br>
HUTCHINSON: I've something rather special in mind for her. <br>
JANE: Detaining people against their will is illegal, Sir George. The
Doctor and his friends included. <br>
HUTCHINSON: I shouldn't let that bother you, Miss Hampden. As the local
magistrate, I shall find myself quite innocent. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barn]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Twinkly lights appear on the upper level, then a
torso and finally an ancient face appears.) <br>
TEGAN: Oh, no! Come on! Help! <br>
(The face glides down toward her as she pulls at the door. Then
Turlough pushes it open from outside, knocking her down. The apparition
vanishes.) <br>
TEGAN: Oh, it's you. <br>
TURLOUGH: What's happening? <br>
TEGAN: Later. Let's get away from here first. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Village]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Little Hodcombe village square and cross are
played by Shapwick, Dorset.)<br>
DOCTOR: Turlough! Tegan! <br>
(The disfigured man knocks the Doctor down. He's carrying Tegan's bag.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Wait! Come back! <br>
(The man is at the far end of a lane by the time the Doctor gets back
on his feet.) <br>
DOCTOR: How could he get so far? <br>
(The Doctor gives chase. <br>
Meanwhile, Wolsey and three troopers ride up to the village cross.) <br>
WOLSEY: We'll never find her. She could be anywhere. <br>
WILLOW: Ask for more men. <br>
WOLSEY: Hutchinson won't allow it. He's got everyone guarding the
perimeter. <br>
WILLOW: We're wasting our time with only four searching. If he wants
her so badly, he's got to find more men. <br>
WOLSEY: Ring him. <br>
(They are next to a public telephone box.) <br>
WILLOW: Not allowed. I'll have to go back to the house. <br>
WOLSEY: All right. Carry on searching, you two. Try Verney's cottage
again. She might be there. I'll come with you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Church]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Hello? I saw you enter. All I want is
Tegan's bag. What have you done with her? I know you can hear me. <br>
(The sound of warfare drifts inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gunpowder. <br>
(The shouting gets very loud. The Doctor clutches his head. Suddenly it
stops as a young man breaks through a blocked up door. He speaks with a
Mummerset accent.) <br>
CHANDLER: Sorry it took me so long. Thought he'd never eat. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? I'm the Doctor. <br>
CHANDLER: Doctor? That don't be a proper name. Will Chandler be a
proper name. <br>
(The Doctor steps forward and the young man grabs a piece of stone.) <br>
DOCTOR: I won't hurt you. <br>
CHANDLER: I will hit 'ee. My hand's hurting. <br>
DOCTOR: Show me. <br>
(The Doctor examines his right arm.) <br>
DOCTOR: What were you doing in there? <br>
CHANDLER: It's a priest hole, innit. I hid from fighting. <br>
DOCTOR: What fighting? <br>
CHANDLER: What fighting? Ere, where you been then? <br>
DOCTOR: What year is this? <br>
CHANDLER: Ah, I knows that one. Year sixteen hundred and forty three. <br>
DOCTOR: Sixteen hundred and forty three. <br>
CHANDLER: Is the battle done? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, yes, Will. Battle's done. <br>
(Tegan and Turlough run in. Will hides behind a pew.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, just in time. <br>
TEGAN: Time? We almost didn't make it. <br>
TURLOUGH: We have to get out of here. <br>
TEGAN: There's something very strange going on. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. <br>
TURLOUGH: Who is that? <br>
DOCTOR: Will Chandler. <br>
CHANDLER: Sir? <br>
TEGAN: Where did he come from? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, that's something we're going to have to talk about. </font></p>

hand when voices are heard outside.) <br>
MAN [OC]: We lost them through the woods. <br>
(Wolsey and Willow enter.) <br>
HUTCHINSON: Where is she? <br>
WOLSEY: We can't find her. We need more men. <br>
HUTCHINSON: I want Tegan, not excuses, Wolsey. <br>
JANE: Don't listen to him, Ben. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Miss Hampden, you are beginning to bore me with your
constant bleating. <br>
WILLOW: She doesn't understand. We must have our Queen of the May. <br>
HUTCHINSON: Precisely. Think of it as the resurrection of an old
tradition. <br>
JANE: Not the way you'd like to celebrate it. I know the old custom of
this village. I know what happens to a May Queen at the end of her
reign. <br>
WOLSEY: We're not going to harm her. <br>
JANE: You might not. I'm not so sure about them. <br>
HUTCHINSON: The tradition must continue. Something is coming to our
village. Something very wonderful and strange. <br>
(Hutchinson leaves.) <br>
WOLSEY: We must find Tegan. <br>
JANE: You're so gullible, Ben. You'll do anything he says. <br>
(Wolsey leaves.) <br>
JANE: Right, I'm going to the police. I'll soon put a stop to this. <br>
WILLOW: Shut up! Just be grateful it is the stranger who is to be
crowned Queen of the May. It so easily could have been you. <br>
(Jane slaps Willow and turns away.) <br>
WILLOW: And it still might be if we don't find her. <br>
(Willow leaves, locking the door behind him.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Church]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: There's been a confusion in time. Somehow
1984 has become linked with 1643. <br>
TURLOUGH: What about the apparitions? <br>
DOCTOR: Psychic projections. <br>
TEGAN: The man we saw when we arrived? He was real enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Still a psychic projection, but with substance. <br>
TURLOUGH: Matter projected from the past? That would require enormous
energy. <br>
DOCTOR: An alien power source. <br>
TEGAN: What about Will? <br>
DOCTOR: A projection, too, and at the moment a benign one. <br>
(Will is asleep on a pew.) <br>
TURLOUGH: This crack has got larger. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Ominous, isn't it? As is the fact your grandfather has
disappeared. I think it's time I sought some answers. <br>
TEGAN: Where? <br>
(The Doctor takes a coin from his pocket and holds his hands behind his
back. Then he brings his fists in front, weighs them, and opens the
empty one.) <br>
DOCTOR: The village. <br>
TEGAN: Always so scientific. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Will. You're coming with me. <br>
TEGAN: What about us? <br>

DOCTOR: What's the matter? Will? Will, what happened in 1643? <br>
CHANDLER: Troopers come. <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, no. Something else. <br>
CHANDLER: Malus come. Malus's got to war, ain't he? He makes fighting
worse. He makes them hate more. <br>
DOCTOR: The Malus is just a superstition. <br>

appear? <br>
CHANDLER: It was Roundheads and Cavaliers, and they were fighting in
church. And there was a wind coming. Such a wind. And then Malus, he
came from nowhere. <br>
DOCTOR: What did it look like? Like this? Did it look like this? <br>
(The Doctor points to the etching, which we see looks like the
apparition Tegan saw.) <br>
CHANDLER: Yes! <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. <br>

JANE: It's not like Sir George to give up so easily. <br>

discovered. He's our local historian. <br>

Will Chandler with Jane straggling behind.) <br>
JANE: Oh, slow down. What do you mean, this is from the planet Ragga? <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely what I said. The Tereleptils mine tinclavic for more
or less the exclusive use of the people of Hakol. That's in the star
system Rifta, you know. <br>
JANE: Oh, no. I've escaped from one madman to find another. Do you
expect me to believe what you're saying? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you take that sample to any metallurgist and they'll
confirm it isn't from this planet. <br>
JANE: You're serious. <br>
DOCTOR: Never more so. <br>
JANE: Very well, then. For the sake of argument, I'll accept what you
say, but how did it come to Little Hodcombe? <br>
DOCTOR: As part of a space vehicle. <br>
JANE: A space ship from Hakol landed here? Is that what you're trying
to say? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, more likely a computer-controlled reconnaissance vehicle.
<br>
JANE: How silly of me not to know. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, was Andrew Verney engaged in any research concerning
the Malus? <br>
JANE: I believe he was, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: That's what must have led him to the tunnel and the remains of
the Hakol probe. <br>
CHANDLER: See? I seen the Malus. <br>
DOCTOR: I believe you, Will. My sincerest apologies for ever doubting
you. <br>
JANE: Doctor, the Malus is a myth, a legend. Some mumbo-jumbo connected
with apparitions or something. <br>
DOCTOR: That's precisely what Will saw. You see, on Hakol, psychic
energy is a force that's been harnessed in much the same way as
electricity is here. <br>
JANE: But what has that got to do with the Malus legend? <br>
DOCTOR: The thing you call the Malus was on board the Hakol probe. <br>
JANE: Oh. I see what you mean. It's still here. Doctor, that wasn't
there the other day. <br>
(Jane goes over to the widening crack in the church wall. A chunk of
plaster falls away and she squeals.) <br>
CHANDLER: Don't touch it.! <br>
JANE: He's right, Doctor. There's suddenly a very strange atmosphere in
here. <br>
(The Doctor pulls more plaster away to make a very large hole in the
wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, come and have a look at this. <br>
CHANDLER: No! No! <br>

DOCTOR: Do you know anything about psychic energy? <br>
JANE: Oh, you know I don't. <br>
DOCTOR: Then a quick lesson. It can of course occur in many and varied
forms, but the type here, capable of creating projections, requires a
focus point. <br>
JANE: Uh huh? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear, oh dear. A medium. <br>
JANE: Oh, as with a poltergeist? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, a bit more complicated. In this it isn't the medium that's
creating the projections, but the Malus. The medium simply gathers all
the psychic energy for it to use. And what at the moment is creating
the most psychic energy? <br>
JANE: Um, er. <br>
DOCTOR: The war games. <br>
JANE: The war games? <br>
DOCTOR: And who controls the games? <br>
JANE: You'd better speak to Sir George. <br>

JANE: It's been there for hundreds of years. <br>
DOCTOR: Long before the Civil War started. <br>
JANE: Then why has it been dormant for so long? <br>
(They start up the stairs.) <br>
DOCTOR: It requires a massive force of psychic energy to activate it.
When the Civil War came to Little Hodcombe, it created precisely that. <br>
JANE: And Sir George is trying to recreate the same event. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, in every detail. Tegan's grandfather must have told him
everything he discovered. He knows it's the only way for the Malus to
be fully activated. <br>

out the whole village to search for you. The Doctor won't stand a

(He drops a pistol as he clutches at his head. Willow enters with his
dagger drawn and goes up to Wolsey, who also pulls a dagger.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
(Turlough and the Doctor pull them apart. Will runs up to Hutchinson
and pushes him into the Malus.) <br>
CHANDLER: It better you be dead! <br>
(Hutchinson dies with a scream.) <br>
CHANDLER: It be better he be dead. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, Will. It's all right. <br>
JANE: We must seal up the church. <br>
VERNEY: And inform the authorities. It has to be destroyed. <br>
(The roof starts to fall in.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Now what? <br>
DOCTOR: The Malus knows it's lost. It's going to fulfil its
programming, Clear the ground, destroy everything it can. Come on! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Crypt]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Quickly! Inside. <br>
TURLOUGH: Does it have the power? <br>
DOCTOR: Enough to keep Will here and level a church. Come along. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Close the door, would you? <br>
(Jane does so.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises as the roof and tower fall in on the church.
Then it explodes.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Malus has destroyed itself. <br>
WOLSEY: Thank God. <br>
JANE: Well, now that it's gone, was it a beast or a machine? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, a living being, reengineered as an instrument of war and
sent here to clear the way for an invasion. <br>
TURLOUGH: What went wrong? Why didn't they invade? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't honestly know. I must look to see if there's anything
in the computer about it. <br>
TURLOUGH: If the Malus is destroyed, why is Will still here? You did
say he was only a psychic projection. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, yes. It seems I was mistaken. The Malus was able to
intermingle the two time zones for a living being to pass through. Must
have had incredible power. <br>
TEGAN: That's the last time I pay an unexpected call on you. <br>
VERNEY: As a rule, the villagers and I are much more welcoming. <br>
WOLSEY: There'll be lots of clearing up to do, in more ways than one.
We'll need all the help we can get. <br>
(Wolsey offers his hand to Willow, who shakes it.) <br>
WILLOW: And no recriminations? <br>
WOLSEY: Not on my part. <br>
JANE: Nor mine. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that seems to be it. We'll drop you all off, then we'll
be on our way. <br>
TURLOUGH: Er, what about our young friend here? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, him too. 1643 isn't all that far away. <br>
TEGAN: Aren't you forgetting something? <br>
DOCTOR: Probably. It isn't unusual. I've had a very hard day. <br>
TEGAN: Well, we came here to visit my grandfather. Be nice to spend a
little time with him. <br>
TURLOUGH: I must admit I wouldn't mind staying for a while. <br>
JANE: Hmm, you're outnumbered seven to one. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm being bullied, coerced, forced against my will. I've had
enough for one day. <br>
VERNEY: Even if you are, agree, man. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. Just for a little while. We've a great deal to do. <br>
TURLOUGH: Good. I quite miss that brown liquid they drink here. <br>
CHANDLER: Ale. <br>
TURLOUGH: No, er, tea. <br>
CHANDLER: What be tea? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, a noxious infusion of oriental leaves containing a high
percentage of toxic acid. <br>
CHANDLER: Sounds an evil brew, don't it. <br>
DOCTOR: True. Personally, I rather like it.&nbsp; </font> </p>
