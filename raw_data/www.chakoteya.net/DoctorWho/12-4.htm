<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mist swirls across the rocky ground of Betchworth
Quarry. Suddenly, a head in tin helmet and gas mask pops up from behind
a ridge. Then a second, and a third, and more. Like World War One
troops going over the top of the trenches, they advance - and promptly
get mown down by machine gun fire. <br>
The Doctor appears, trying to keep warm, and looks around him. There is
no one to be seen.) <br>
TIMELORD: Ah. Welcome, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What's going on? Don't you realise how dangerous it is to
intercept a transmat beam? <br>
TIMELORD: Oh come, Doctor, not with our techniques. We Time Lords
transcended such simple mechanical devices when the universe was less
than half its present size. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, whatever I've done for you in the past, I've more than
made up for. I will not tolerate this continual interference in my
life. <br>
TIMELORD: Continual? We pride ourselves we seldom interfere in the
affairs of others. <br>
DOCTOR: Except mine. <br>
TIMELORD: You, Doctor, are a special case. You enjoy the freedom we
allow you. In return, occasionally, not continually, we ask you to do
something for us. <br>
DOCTOR: I won't do it. Whatever it is, I refuse. <br>
TIMELORD: Daleks. <br>
DOCTOR: Daleks? Tell me more. <br>
TIMELORD: We foresee a time when they will have destroyed all other
lifeforms and become the dominant creature in the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: That's possible. Tell on. <br>
TIMELORD: We'd like you to return to Skaro at a point in time before
the Daleks evolved. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mean avert their creation? <br>
TIMELORD: Or affect their genetic development so that they evolve into
less aggressive creatures. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. That's feasible. <br>
TIMELORD: Alternatively, if you learn enough about their very
beginnings, you might discover some inherent weakness. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, just one more time. <br>
TIMELORD: You'll do it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. If you'll let me have the space time coordinates, I'll set
the Tardis for Skaro. <br>
TIMELORD: There's no need for that, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Huh? <br>
TIMELORD: You're here. This is Skaro. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
TIMELORD: We thought it would save time if we assumed your agreement. <br>
(The Time Lord holds up a gold bangle with a three-ended swirl on it.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's this? <br>
TIMELORD: A Time Ring. It will return you to the Tardis when you've
finished here. There's just one thing. <br>
DOCTOR: What's that? <br>
TIMELORD: Be careful not to lose it. That Time Ring is your lifeline.
Good luck, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a moment. <br>
(But he has already vanished.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't just disappear! What about Sarah and Harry? <br>
(The Doctor puts the Time Ring on his left wrist and moves on. Sarah
and Harry appear over a small ridge.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, there you are, Sarah. <br>
HARRY: I say, Doctor, that was a pretty rough landing. What happened? <br>
SARAH: Yes, where are we? This isn't the beacon. <br>
DOCTOR: No, there's been a slight change of plan. <br>
(Boom!) <br>
DOCTOR: This is Skaro. <br>
(Wheeeeee!) <br>
HARRY: I say, that's gunfire. <br>
DOCTOR: Heavy artillery. <br>
(Boom!) <br>
SARAH: Doctor, it's getting closer! <br>
DOCTOR: It's a creeping barrage. Get down! <br>
(They leap into a nearby bomb crater as explosions happen all around
them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Something's annoyed them. <br>
(The barrage stops.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor. Doctor, look. <br>
(It's a soldier in a gas mask.) <br>
DOCTOR: All right. <br>
(The Doctor picks up his rifle as Harry checks him over.) <br>
HARRY: Nothing can be done for this chap. <br>
DOCTOR: That's strange. There's centuries between these two weapons. <br>
(He picks up a ray gun.) <br>
SARAH: What's that on his jacket? <br>
HARRY: Radiation detector and a gas mask. The two things don't go
together, do they. <br>
SARAH: Part of his uniform is made of animal skins, and yet the combat
jacket is a modern synthetic fibre. <br>
DOCTOR: It's like finding the remains of a stone age man with a
transistor radio. <br>
HARRY: Playing rock music? <br>
DOCTOR: A thousand year war? Civilisation on the point of collapse. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Just theorising, that's all. <br>
(He puts the weapons down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come along. <br>
HARRY: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, forward. <br>
(They move on through the desolate terrain, past corpses and through a
pile of large rocks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Halt! Don't move. <br>
SARAH: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: I see a land mine. We're in the middle of a mine field. Follow
me and tread in my footsteps. <br>
SARAH: Good King Wenceslas. <br>
(The Doctor looks up at the cliffs.) <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I thought I saw something move. I have a feeling we're being
watched. <br>
SARAH: I get that feeling, too. <br>
HARRY: I can't see anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's hope its imagination. <br>
(The Doctor suddenly stops.) <br>
HARRY: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Harry, I'm standing on a land mine. I felt it shift. <br>
(Sure enough, something round and metal is amongst the chips of rock
under his left foot.) <br>
DOCTOR: If I move my foot, it might detonate it. <br>
HARRY: Don't move your foot. <br>
DOCTOR: I won't. <br>
(Harry kneels carefully and touches the mine.) <br>
HARRY: It's rocking. <br>
SARAH: Wedge something under it. Make it firm. <br>
HARRY: Yes, I'm trying to, Sarah. Back up, Sarah. <br>
DOCTOR: You back up too, Harry. No point in risking both our lives. <br>
HARRY: No, Doctor, you'll have a better chance if I hold it firm. <br>
DOCTOR: Please, Harry, don't be difficult. <br>
HARRY: Don't you argue, Doctor. Now, just lift your foot very, very
gently. <br>
(The Doctor does so, and nothing goes bang.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Harry. <br>
HARRY: My pleasure. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's go. <br>
(Up on the cliff, something watches them move on. They arrive at a load
of barbed wire.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hey, look. What do you think? <br>
(A squat dome is a little way away.) <br>
SARAH: It's like a big bubble. <br>
DOCTOR: Protective dome. <br>
SARAH: What, large enough to cover an entire city? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
HARRY: Why are they fighting with old fashioned things like barbed wire
and land mines if they can build something like that? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Trenches]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor, Harry and Sarah pass through a gap in
the sandbags to discover that the soldiers defending the entrance are
all corpses.) <br>
DOCTOR: Even the dead have a part to play. Propped up to make the
trenches appear fully manned. <br>
HARRY: A different sort of uniform from that other chaps. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we may have crossed the lines. <br>
SARAH: Same mixture of ancient and modern, though. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. That's why I think this war's been going on for a very
long time. They probably started out with the most modern equipment but
no longer have the resources. They have to make do. <br>
HARRY: War of attrition, eh, only backwards. At this rate they're going
to finish off with bows and arrows. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it would explain the mixture of equipment. <br>
SARAH: Psst. Here. <br>
(Sarah has found a door.) <br>
HARRY: Careful, Sarah. <br>
SARAH: It's all right. It's locked. <br>
HARRY: It's pretty solid, isn't it. Some kind of service tunnel, I
suppose. It might even lead into the dome. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's see where the trench leads. <br>
(As they move away, a panel in the door opens and eyes look out. There
is a whizz, and something explodes nearby.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's a gas shell! <br>
SARAH: Gas! <br>
DOCTOR: Poison gas! <br>
HARRY: Respirators, quick! <br>
(They plunder the corpses for their gas masks. Then troops in the
rag-tag uniforms come to fight them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Get back! <br>
(They are quickly over powered, then men in neater black uniforms burst
out through the door and machine gun them down. The Doctor groans.) <br>
SOLDIER: This one's alive. Get him inside. <br>
(They pick up the Doctor.) <br>
SOLDIER: There's another one here. Get him inside, quickly. <br>
(Harry is taken away, and Sarah is left behind.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Storeroom]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Once inside, their rescuers help remove their
gasmasks. The Doctor seems to be in a bad way.) <br>
KALED: They don't look like Thals. I wonder? There've been rumours
recently that the Thals were developing robots. Anyway, stick them on
the transporter. I shall alert Command Headquarters with General Ravon.
<br>
(The soldier gets into the front of an electric trolley on tracks, with
the Doctor and Harry sitting behind him.) <br>
KALED: Count the ammunition and clean your weapons. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Strategy room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A model of the area fills a table. Ravon, played
by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0801838/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Guy
Siner</a>, moves a red piece with a white circle on it back over
the ridge towards another dome. That represent his side, while the blue
pieces with crosses are the Thals. The electric trolley arrives.) <br>
RAVON: Well? <br>
KALED: Two prisoners, sir, captured section 101. <br>
RAVON: For interrogation. Good. I enjoy interrogation. <br>
DOCTOR Yes, you look the type. <br>
(The Doctor gets punched in the kidneys for that.) <br>
RAVON: You insolent muto. <br>
KALED: Sir? <br>
RAVON: What? <br>
KALED: My section totally destroyed the Thal attackers except for these
two, but our supply of ammunition is running low. <br>
RAVON: Then conserve it! Ammunition is valuable and cannot be wasted. <br>
KALED: Yes, sir. <br>
RAVON: For instance, when I've finished with these two animals, they'll
be hanged. Not taken out and shot as in the past. And that will be all.
Return to your unit. <br>
(The soldier clicks his heels together and raises his right arm. Ravon
returns the salute. The soldier and his companion leave, and Ravon
unholsters his pistol. There is one guard left, standing over Harry.) <br>
RAVON: So, the Thals have come down to recruiting mutos, have they?
Turn out your pockets! <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly. <br>
(Sonic screwdriver, magnifying glass, eye-piece, yo-yo and other bits
are dumped on the map table.) <br>
DOCTOR: It might take some time. <br>
RAVON: Take a good look. In a few weeks we're going to change the shape
of that map forever. We'll wipe the Thals from the face of Skaro. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I've heard that before. <br>
RAVON: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I was just wondering how you propose to wipe the Thals from the
face of Skaro with boy soldiers, no ammunition, and very young
generals. <br>
RAVON: You've had one warning about your insolence. <br>
(A telephone device buzzes, and the guard goes to answer it.) <br>
DOCTOR: I do beg your pardon. <br>
RAVON: When victory is ours, we'll wipe every trace of the Thals and
their city from the face of this land. We will avenge the deaths of all
Kaleds who've fallen in the cause of right and justice, and build a
peace which will be a monument to their sacrifice. Our battle cry will
be, 'total extermination of the Thals'! <br>
DOCTOR: That's very impressive. You mean you're going to sweep these
wastelands absolutely? <br>
(The Doctor waves the pointer over the table then down hard on Ravon's
gun hand. The weapon flies out of his hand straight to Harry, who uses
it to cover the guard. The Doctor throws a bunch of keys on a ring over
to him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Harry. Did I hurt your fingers? <br>
RAVON: You'll never get out of here alive. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so you said. <br>
(Harry handcuffs the guard to a chair. The Doctor goes to the console
where the telephone is, and flicks a few switches.) <br>
DOCTOR: So you're Kaleds, eh? <br>
(Then he uses the sonic screwdriver to short circuit the whole thing.) <br>
RAVON: Even you mutos know the difference between Thals and Kaleds. <br>
DOCTOR: K A L E D S. Why, that's an anagram of. How interesting. Are
you fit, Harry? <br>
HARRY: Never felt fitter, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Now, Alexander the Great, you're going to lead us out of
here. <br>
RAVON: Never! <br>
DOCTOR: You won't get any medals for being stupid, General. In fact,
you won't be getting any more medals for anything. <br>
RAVON: Where do you want me to take you? <br>
DOCTOR: Back to the wastelands. <br>
RAVON: Yes, that's home to you mutos, isn't it. But you won't get that
far, I promise you. <br>
HARRY: Come on, we're wasting time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Trenches]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sarah wakes amongst the corpses.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor? Doctor? Harry? <br>
(She tries the door but it is locked, then picks her way out of the
trench.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HARRY: Where are we? This isn't leading to the
surface. <br>
RAVON: There's a platform lift at the end. You mutos must have seen it.
<br>
HARRY: You're still making the same mistake. We're not mutos, whatever
they may be. <br>
RAVON: Only mutos live in the wastelands. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
(They arrive at the lift.) <br>
HARRY: I hope Sarah's all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
RAVON: If you've a friend up there they won't last much longer. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean? <br>
RAVON: Night's coming on. The mutos start moving at night. <br>
(Someone else is walking the corridors. Harry puts the pistol firmly
into the small of Ravon's back.) <br>
HARRY: Just remember we're your friends. <br>
(Another black-uniformed, sour-faced man arrives with two guards.) <br>
NYDER: General Ravon. <br>
RAVON: Nyder. <br>
NYDER: I wish to see you. <br>
RAVON: If you'll wait in my office, Nyder, I'll be a few minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps you should introduce us, General. <br>
RAVON: Security Commander Nyder. <br>
NYDER: You're civilians, I see. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but we're not staying long. Don't let us detain you. <br>
NYDER: You won't. <br>
(Nyder and his guards walk away, then) <br>
NYDER: Down, Ravon! <br>
(The guards open fire as the Doctor and Harry duck and run. The guards
give chase. Nyder goes to the wall and presses a comm. button.) <br>
NYDER: Alert all guards. Two Thal intruders in the command complex. <br>
(The Doctor and Harry run through the maze of square metal corridors.) <br>
DOCTOR: This way, Harry! <br>
(Four more guards give chase. Meanwhile, back at the lift.) <br>
RAVON: They took me by surprise! <br>
NYDER: Fool. What kind of soldier lets two unarmed prisoners overpower
him in his own headquarters? <br>
RAVON: There's something different about those two. They're not Thals
and they're not mutos. <br>
NYDER: We'll find out what's different about them by autopsy. <br>
(A metal lift door slams in the Doctor and Harry's faces.) <br>
HARRY: We're trapped. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(The lift door opens again.) <br>
DOCTOR: After you. <br>
(The door shuts just before guards fire at them. Nyder arrives and uses
the comm. again.) <br>
NYDER: Alert surface patrols to watch for intruders in the area of
platform lift seven. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Skaro]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Harry and the Doctor get off the metal platform
and run.) <br>
HARRY: Now what? <br>
DOCTOR: Keep running. <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Keep running! <br>
(Up on a ridge, soldiers in capes shoot at them. Further on is a trip
wire. The Doctor spots it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Down, Harry! <br>
(Harry triggers the trip as he falls. Boom!) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right? <br>
HARRY: That was a lucky escape. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't say that, Harry. <br>
(They are surrounded by men with guns. Elsewhere, Sarah is wandering in
the mist.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor? Harry? Doctor. Harry. <br>
(Something is nearby, dragging one foot in the dirt. Sarah finds the
lift, and runs on. The shabby creature follows.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Strategy room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Nyder is using the Doctor's magnifying glass to
examine one of the small devices that came from his pockets.) <br>
NYDER: This is yours? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
NYDER: What is its function? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's an etheric beam locator. It's also useful for
detecting ion charged emissions. <br>
NYDER: Oh, really. It is not of Thal manufacture. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, naturally not. My friend and I are not from your planet. <br>
NYDER: Aliens? <br>
HARRY: Humans. Well, I am, anyway. <br>
NYDER: I've heard Davros say there is no intelligent life on other
planets, so either he is wrong or you are lying. <br>
DOCTOR: We are not lying. <br>
NYDER: And Davros is never wrong about anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Then he must be exceptional. Even I am occasionally wrong about
some things. Who is this Davros? <br>
NYDER: Our greatest scientist. He's in charge of all research at the
bunker. <br>
RAVON: They could be mutos, Nyder. Intelligent mutos who've developed a
technology. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, what exactly are mutos? <br>
NYDER: Mutos are the scarred relics of ourselves. Monsters created by
the chemical weapons used in the first century of this war. They were
banished into the wastelands where they live and scavenge like animals.
<br>
DOCTOR: In other words, genetically wounded. <br>
NYDER: We must keep the Kaled race pure. Imperfects are rejected. Some
of them survive out there. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a very harsh policy. <br>
HARRY: It's horrible. <br>
NYDER: Your views are not important. General Ravon, I'll take these two
back to the bunker for interrogation by the special unit. <br>
RAVON: They're the army's prisoners. <br>
NYDER: Then you will release them to me. The special unit will get more
out of them than your crude methods ever would. <br>
RAVON: Very well, if you insist. <br>
NYDER: I do insist, General. And I have a list of requirements here.
All these items are to be sent to the bunker immediately. <br>
RAVON: I can't spare this equipment. These spare parts alone would take
more than half my supply. <br>
NYDER: You'll notice the requisition is countersigned by Davros
himself. If you would like to take the matter up with him. <br>
RAVON: I'm expected to fight a war without equipment. Very well, I'll
have these things out to the bunker by dawn. <br>
NYDER: By midnight, General. The order specifies midnight. <br>
RAVON: By midnight. <br>
NYDER: Good. <br>
(They 'heil Davros' or whatever.) <br>
NYDER: Bring the prisoners. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Sarah tries to flee from the shambling figure
behind her, but another one has joined it and a third is above on a
ridge. Then she comes upon some bombed out buildings. Inside, a wizened
figure in black leather is seated inside what looks like the lower half
of a Dalek. He has an artificial eye in his forehead because his own
sockets are blank. Sarah ducks down and watches another Kaled
approach.) <br>
KALED: Ready, Davros. <br>
(Davros replies with a slightly mechanical voice.) <br>
DAVROS: Observe the test closely, my friend. This will be a moment that
will live in history. <br>
(A long-nailed hand moves across the console on his lower casing and
flicks a switch. A full Dalek moves forward and Sarah's eyes open
wide.) <br>
DAVROS: Halt. Turn right. Halt. <br>
(The Dalek obeys the commands.) <br>
DAVROS: Now, exterminate! <br>
(The Dalek destroys three cardboard targets.) <br>
DAVROS: Perfect. The weaponry is perfect. Now we can begin. </font></p>

security area.) <br>
TANE: Party approaching. Check one. <br>

TANE: You will announce your name, rank and serial number. Speak now. <br>
NYDER [OC]: Tane, this is Security Commander Nyder with prisoners and
escort. <br>
(Tane presses the button that opens the steel doors. Nyder enters with
the Doctor and Harry.) <br>
NYDER: I want these two screened and passed to Ronson for full
interrogation. <br>
TANE: Yes, sir. <br>
NYDER: Prisoner's belongings. <br>
(Nyder hands over the etheric beam locator and the rest of the stuff in
a plastic box, then salutes and leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Well, now he's gone, any chance of a cup of tea? <br>
TANE: What! <br>
DOCTOR: Or coffee. My friend and I have had a very trying experience.
Haven't we had a trying experience, Harry? <br>
HARRY: Very trying, Doctor. <br>
TANE: Step into the security scan. <br>
DOCTOR: What, no tea? <br>
TANE: Let me point out to you that you have no rights whatsoever. I
have full authority to torture and kill any prisoner who does not
comply absolutely with my orders. That is your first and last warning. <br>
DOCTOR: No tea, Harry. <br>
(Harry is made to stand in a body scanner with two large boxes at chest
height. The hum hurts Harry's head.) <br>
TANE: You're cleared. Move forward. You, next. <br>
(The Doctor takes Harry's place in the scanner. It beeps.) <br>
TANE: Scan detects power source located below prisoner's left elbow.
Remove object from prisoner's left wrist. <br>
(The guard pulls off the Time Ring.) <br>
DOCTOR: You can't have that. That bracelet could have no possible use
as a weapon. <br>
TANE: It remains with the other confiscated items. <br>
(Tane puts it in the box.) <br>
HARRY: Let's not make a fuss, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: The Time Ring is our only hope of getting back to the Tardis. <br>
TANE: Two prisoners at checkpoint. Awaiting orders. <br>
DOCTOR: Recovering it has got to be our number one priority. Do you
understand, Harry? It's vital. <br>
HARRY: Yes, I know it's vital, but we don't want them to know that, do
we? <br>
TANE: The prisoners are to be given into the custody of Senior
Researcher Ronson. Here, take this with you. <br>
(Tane gives the box to a guard. Tane opens an inner door.) <br>
TANE: Move! <br>

SEVRIN: She's beautiful. No deformities, no imperfections. <br>
GERRILL: She is a norm. All norms are our enemies. Kill her now for
what she's done to our kind. <br>
SEVRIN: No, why? Why must we always destroy beauty? Why kill another
creature because it is not in our image? <br>
GERRILL: Kill her! It is the law. All norms must die. They are our
enemies. And if you won't, I will. <br>
(The two mutos struggle.) <br>
MUTO: There's something over there. <br>
SEVRIN: It's a patrol, very close. <br>
GERRILL: Let's get away from here. <br>
SEVRIN: No. No, they're too near. If you move, they'll see you. <br>

SEVRIN: No, I tell you they'll see you. <br>

He flees and they shoot him in the back.) <br>
THAL: Oh, it's only a muto. What a waste of good ammunition. There's a
couple more of them. <br>
(He shines his torch on Sarah and Sevrin.) <br>
THAL: Hold it. If they're not too badly mutated, we might be able to
use them. They still need expendable labour for the rocket loader. (re
Sevrin) This one looks all right. Got all it needs to carry and walk.
(re Sarah) There's no reason why this one shouldn't work. Why, it's
almost a norm. Come on, get up. Up! Oh, kill it off, it's too slow. <br>
SEVRIN: No, it's all right. I'll help her. <br>
THAL: Then move, and move quietly. There are Kaled patrols out tonight.

RONSON: That depends. If you don't answer my questions, I shall hand

where did you get these things? <br>

RONSON: It is an established scientific fact that in the seven galaxies
only Skaro is capable of supporting intelligent life. <br>
DOCTOR: It is also an established scientific fact that there are more

RONSON: Indeed. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>

ran a complete check on your blood and chemical make up,
encephalographic patterns and so on. Physiological compositions. And
so, if you are from another planet <br>

DOCTOR: You were saying? <br>

KALED [OC]: Davros wishes all members of the Elite scientific corps to
assemble in the main laboratory immediately. <br>
RONSON: Our session will have to wait. Davros is coming. <br>
DOCTOR: Your chief scientist. <br>
RONSON: He's our supreme commander. When he calls a full meeting like
this, he obviously has something of the greatest importance to tell us.
<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I shall be delighted to meet him. <br>
RONSON: Stand up and keep quiet. <br>
(Davros enters with Nyder and his guards.) <br>
DAVROS: If I may have your attention. For some time I have been
experimenting with the Mark Three project. Details of modifications
will be distributed later. However, I am anxious that you should see
immediately the remarkable results that I have achieved, and to that
end I have arranged this demonstration. <br>
(The door next to the filing cabinets opens and a giant pepperpot
glides in. It only has a sink plunger attachment, and no weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) A Dalek. <br>
HARRY: (sotto) What? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) A Dalek. Very primitive but undeniably a Dalek. <br>
RONSON: (sotto) You're mistaken. It's a Mark Three travel machine. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) If you say so. <br>
DAVROS: Halt. Turn left. Move forward. <br>
RONSON: That's magnificent. He's perfected voice control. <br>
DAVROS: Turn right. Move forward and circle left. You will agree, I
think, that voice control represents an enormous step forward, however
the best is yet to come. Nyder. <br>
(Nyder opens a box and removes the gun unit. He hands it to an aide who
attaches it to the Dalek.) <br>
DAVROS: Our machine is now equipped with a weapon for self-defence.
Now, I am going to turn the machine over to total self-control. It will
be entirely independent of all outside influences. A living, thinking,
self-supporting creature. <br>
(Davros flicks a switch. The gun arm rises and the Dalek turns to
survey the assembled people, stopping at the Doctor.) <br>
DAVROS: Brilliant. Brilliant! It has detected the non-conformity. <br>
DALEK: Aliens. I must exterminate. Exterminate. <br>
RONSON: No! <br>
(Ronson goes to Davros and puts the switch back. The Dalek's gun drops.
<br>
DAVROS: You dare to interfere! You have the audacity to interrupt one
of my experiments? <br>
RONSON: But it would have destroyed him. <br>
DAVROS: So you think the saving of a worthless life more important than
the progress we have made? My creature showed a natural desire, an
instinct to destroy, and you interceded! You will be punished for this!
<br>
RONSON: Davros, I'm sorry, but I believe that these prisoners, they
could be extremely valuable. By all means, when I have my questions,
let the machine do what it likes with them, but I do need to
interrogate them further. <br>
DAVROS: You will be punished for insubordination. In the meantime, you
may question the prisoners until first light. After that, they will be
used to resume the experiment. This meeting is ended. <br>
(Davros leaves, and the scientists gather around the Dalek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. I am obliged to you. <br>
RONSON: I was merely doing my duty. I believe that you have knowledge
which could be of the greatest assistance to us. But if you don't
cooperate, then it is certain that Davros will use you as an experiment
with his machine in a few hours time. <br>
NYDER: The prisoners are to be taken to the cells. You can continue
questioning them there. Davros orders it. </font></p>

SARAH: Where are we? <br>
SEVRIN: We're inside the Thal dome. We should be lucky to be alive. The
Thals normally kill on sight. <br>
SARAH: Then why the change? Why bring us here? <br>
SEVRIN: Perhaps they need slave workers for some project. <br>
KALED: The muto is right. The work they're making us do kills with the
same certainty as a bullet between the eyes. <br>
SARAH: What work? <br>
KALED: The Thals have built a rocket. They've used up all their
manpower and resources. They're gambling that it's going to bring them
victory in one blow. And if they can make the launch successfully, I
don't see how they're going to fail. My race, the whole of the Kaled
people, will be wiped out in seconds. <br>
SEVRIN: Perhaps we should be happy to welcome such a weapon if it ends
a thousand years of war. <br>
KALED: You won't be when you find out what it is. <br>
SARAH: Well, what is it? <br>
KALED: The nose cone of the rocket is being packed with distronic
explosive. We have to put it in position. <br>
SARAH: So? <br>
KALED: To reduce weight, they're using no protective shielding. Every
load we carry exposes us to distronic toxaemia. After a few hours
exposure, we'll all be dead. <br>
SARAH: We'd better think of something, hadn't we. <br>
(The door opens and mutos are hustled out.) <br>
SARAH: Well, now what's happening? <br>
KALED: The rest period's over. We start loading again. I've already
done one load since I was captured. <br>
SARAH: All right, don't push. <br>
(The slaves are lead out to the base of the rocket. The wall has a
monitor on it, with Safe currently lit up. The other end of the scale
is Toxic Level. Another guard drives in an electric buggy with a box on
the back containing sixteen cylinders. As the mutos take one each the
marker on the scale slides up towards Toxic very quickly. As Sarah
takes hers, it gets there.) </font></p>

HARRY: You all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Looks like I might be. <br>
HARRY: What happened? <br>
DOCTOR: They took down reams of notes, every bit of scientific
gobbledygook I could think of. Technical jargon that even I didn't
understand. <br>
HARRY: That'll keep their experts tied up for weeks. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. And I learnt a great deal more from them than they did
from me. <br>
HARRY: About this bunker? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
HARRY: It is underground, isn't it. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and bomb proof. Impregnable from attack from the outside
and about three or four miles from the Kaled dome. <br>
HARRY: What are they doing down here? <br>
DOCTOR: Years ago the Kaled government decided to form an Elite group.
The best scientific brains in every field. <br>
HARRY: A sort of Think Tank. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. But over the years the Elite has become more and more
powerful, and now they can demand whatever they like. <br>

RONSON: There's no need to wait. I am armed. <br>

RONSON: I'm sorry if they hurt you. I lack the courage to interfere. <br>
DOCTOR: But you did save me from becoming the very first victim of a
Dalek, thank you. <br>
RONSON: Yes, now you used that word earlier. It had never been heard
before. And yet only an hour ago, Davros announced that henceforth his
Mark Three travel machine would be referred to as a Dalek. Now how
could you have known that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I have an advantage in terms of time. You see, we've come
here at this time because of future concern about the development of
the Dalek. I think you're concerned too, aren't you? <br>
(Ronson goes to the door to check no one is listening.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) I think he's going to bite. <br>
RONSON: Yes, I am concerned, and there are a few other who think the
same as I. But we're powerless. <br>
DOCTOR: Then let us help you. <br>
RONSON: You see, we believe that Davros has changed the direction of
our research into something which is immoral, evil. You see, the Elite
was formed to produce weapons that would end this war. We soon saw that
this was futile and changed the direction of our research into the
survival of our race. But our chemical weapons had already started to
produce genetic mutations. <br>
HARRY: And the mutations were banished out into the wastelands. <br>
RONSON: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: The mutos. <br>
RONSON: Now Davros, he believed that there was no way to reverse this
trend and so he started experiments to establish our final mutational
form. He took living cells, treated them with chemicals and produced
the ultimate creature. Come with me. </font></p>

SARAH: I mean we've got to get out of here. <br>
SEVRIN: It's not possible. <br>
SARAH: Why? The guard's not expecting trouble from a group of exhausted
slave worker. <br>
KALED: So we get out into the rocket silo. Where then? The only other
exit goes out through a command point, and that's going to be crawling
with Thal troops. <br>
SARAH: There is another way. <br>
SEVRIN: Where? <br>
SARAH: Straight up. The scaffolding. It goes right up to the nose cone
of the rocket. Now, if we could get up there, then there's a chance we
could get out onto the surface of the dome. <br>
KALED: It wouldn't be too difficult getting down again. The angle of
the dome is quite gentle. <br>

RONSON: And he's succeeding. He's created a monster, utterly devoid of
conscience. <br>
HARRY: And you want to stop him. <br>
RONSON: Well, I must. There are a few in the Kaled government who still
have the power to act. If they knew the truth, they would end Davros'
power, close down this bunker, finish the Elite. <br>
DOCTOR: Then go to them, Ronson, go to them. <br>

HARRY: Well? <br>
RONSON: The entrance is barred. And there's something else. Davros'

existence you don't even know of. But my knowledge is scientific fact.
Now, Davros has created a machine creature, a monster which will
terrorise and destroy millions and millions of lives and lands
throughout all eternity. He has given this machine a name, a Dalek. It
is a word new to you, but for a thousand generations it is a name that
will bring fear and terror. Now undoubtedly Davros has one of the
finest scientific minds in existence, but he has a fanatical desire to
perpetuate himself in his machine. He works without conscience, without
soul, without pity, and his machines are equally devoid of these

HARRY: Now I think it's high time we looked for Sarah, don't you? <br>
RAVON: The one you left behind in the wastelands? <br>
HARRY: Yes. You have some news of her? <br>
RAVON: I can't be certain, you understand, but our agents inside the
Thal dome report a newly arrived girl prisoner who led an attempted
breakout. Gave the Thals quite a bit of trouble. <br>
HARRY: That'll be her. <br>
DOCTOR: In the Thal dome, you say? <br>
RAVON: The Thals are using prisoners to load their last great rocket. <br>
HARRY: Rocket? <br>
RAVON: They think they'll win the war with it. What they don't know is
that no matter how powerful their rocket, it cannot penetrate our
protective dome. Only a matter of months ago, Davros perfected a new
substance which has the strength of thirty foot thick reinforced
concrete. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, well never mind about that. Could you help us to find
Sarah? <br>
RAVON: One of my agents could lead you into the service shafts
underneath the Thal city. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good, good. <br>
RAVON: But after that you're strictly on your own. <br>
HARRY: Fair enough. <br>
RAVON: Right, I'll give you a map showing how to reach the rocket silo
area. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
HARRY: Well, Doctor, looks as though we've got to cross the wastelands
again. <br>

DAVROS: An investigation? But of course, Mogran. I welcome any inquiry
into our work here. I think the idea is an excellent one. The Kaled
people sacrifice much so that we should have the materials we need.
They have the right to know how our work is progressing. And when they
learn of our achievements, their patriotism will be refired. It is
vital that our soldiers know that they and we of the Elite are as one,
working together to bring the final victory. <br>
MOGRAN: I'm grateful that you've accepted this decision so, so
patriotically. There's one thing more. Until the inquiry, all work is
to be suspended. <br>
DAVROS: If that is your wish, then naturally I will obey. It will take
some time to close down certain pieces of equipment. Shall we say, er,
twenty four hours? <br>
MOGRAN: Twelve. <br>
DAVROS: It will be difficult, but it will be done. <br>
MOGRAN: The members of the tribunal will arrive in that time. Thank
you, Davros, for your cooperation. <br>
DAVROS: It is simply my duty. The inquiry will reveal nothing, except
our loyalty and total dedication to the cause of the Kaled people. <br>
(Mogran and the councillors leave.) <br>
NYDER: We cannot allow this investigation. They cannot fail to see the
dangers to themselves in the Dalek project. <br>
DAVROS: Calm yourself, Nyder. There will be no investigation. <br>
NYDER: But you can't stop it now. <br>
DAVROS: I can and will! The council has signed the death warrant of the
whole of the Kaled people. Only we, the Elite, we and the Daleks will
go on. <br>
NYDER: The whole of the Kaled people? You would go that far? <br>
DAVROS: Did you ever doubt it? <br>
NYDER: No. <br>
DAVROS: There is much to do. I want the genetically conditioned
creatures installed in the machines immediately. Twenty of them. <br>
NYDER: Twenty? <br>
DAVROS: They are our troops in this battle for survival. <br>
NYDER: But they're still very erratic, unstable. <br>
DAVROS: They will not be allowed self control. I will prepare a
computer programme that will limit their actions. After that, we are
going on a journey. </font></p>

DAVROS: This is the measure of my faith. Nyder. <br>
(Nyder hands over a piece of paper.) <br>
NYDER: It is a simple chemical formula. If the substance is loaded into
artillery shells and fired onto the surface of the Kaled dome, it will
weaken the molecular structure and make it brittle. Your rocket will
then be able to penetrate without resistance. <br>
COUNCILLOR: Why are you giving us this information? You know that your
own people, the Kaleds, will be utterly exterminated. <br>

DAVROS: And do they win? Do they always win? <br>
DOCTOR: Not always. They have been defeated, but never utterly
defeated. The Dalek menace always remains. <br>
DAVROS: If, as you say, they become the supreme creatures of war, how
can they lose? How can they fail? <br>
DOCTOR: Misfortune, lack of information, sometimes overwhelming
opposition. <br>
DAVROS: Yes, but tell me, how do the Daleks fail? <br>
DOCTOR: No, Davros, that is a question that the future must keep
secret. <br>
DAVROS: What mistakes do they make? You will tell me! <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
DAVROS: You will tell me! <br>
DOCTOR: No, I will not! <br>
DAVROS: Nyder. <br>

DAVROS: You will tell me because you have a weakness that I have
totally eliminated from the minds of the Daleks so they will always be
superior. A weakness that will make you give me the knowledge to change
the future. You are afflicted with a conscience. </font></p>

because of an attempt by the Daleks to mine the core of the planet. The
magnetic properties of the Earth were... Mars... the Daleks were
defeated by a virus that attacked the insulation on the cables in their
electrical systems. ...In the space year seventeen thousand was halted
by the intervention of a fleet of war rockets from the planet Hyperon.
The rockets were made of a metal that was completely resistant to Dalek
firepower. The Dalek Task Force was completely destroyed. <br>

Defeats will become victories. You have changed the future of the

DOCTOR: I have betrayed the future. Davros, for the last time, consider
what you're doing. Stop the development of the Daleks. <br>
DAVROS: Impossible. It is beyond my control. The workshops are already
fully automated to produce the Dalek machines. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not the machines, it's the minds of the creatures inside
them. Minds that you created. They are totally evil. <br>
DAVROS: Evil? No. No, I will not accept that. They are conditioned
simply to survive. They can survive only by becoming the dominant
species. When all other life forms are suppressed, when the Daleks are
the supreme rulers of the universe, then you will have peace. Wars will
end. They are the power not of evil, but of good. <br>
DOCTOR: Davros, if you had created a virus in your laboratory,
something contagious and infectious that killed on contact, a virus
that would destroy all other forms of life, would you allow its use? <br>
DAVROS: It is an interesting conjecture. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you do it? <br>
DAVROS: The only living thing, a microscopic organism reigning supreme.
A fascinating idea. <br>
DOCTOR: But would you do it? <br>
DAVROS: Yes. Yes. To hold in my hand a capsule that contains such
power, to know that life and death on such a scale was my choice. To
know that the tiny pressure on my thumb, enough to break the glass,
would end everything. Yes, I would do it! That power would set me up
above the gods. And through the Daleks, I shall have that power! <br>

NYDER: What do you want done with this? <br>
DAVROS: For the moment he must be kept alive. He has knowledge that is
vital to our future, and I will drain every last detail of it from his
mind. And then, he will learn the true meaning of pain. <br>
NYDER: I will take him to the detention room. <br>
DAVROS: The dissidents. What progress are they making? <br>
NYDER: Feeling against you is rising. Many of the scientific corps are
openly speaking against you. Even some of the military are joining
them. <br>

DAVROS: They will take action soon? <br>
NYDER: Almost certainly. They outnumber those of us who are loyal.

an hour, I could wipe out their leaders. <br>

DAVROS: I have introduced aggression, without which no race can
survive. <br>
GHARMAN: But aggression without a conscience. <br>
DAVROS: History will show that cooperation between different species is
impossible. One race must survive all others, and to do this it must
dominate. Ruthlessly. <br>
(The Doctor gestures to Sarah for her to get his equipment from
Gharman's desk.) <br>
DAVROS: Now I intend that when all the bickering and battling is over,
the supreme victor shall be our race, the Daleks. <br>
(Sarah hands the etheric beam locator and sonic screwdriver to Harry,
who passes them on to the Doctor.) <br>
DAVROS: At this very moment, the production lines stand ready, totally
automated, fully programmed. The Daleks are no longer dependant on us.
The machinery is ready. They are a power in their own right. If any one
of you would destroy everything that we have ever achieved, then here
is a destruct button. <br>
(Davros goes over to a big red button on a console.) <br>
DAVROS: Press it, and you will destroy this bunker and everything in
it. Only this room will remain. Press it and you will wipe out our
entire race, destroy the Daleks forever. Which of you will do it? <br>
(Silence, and the Kaleds look at each other.) <br>
DAVROS: You are men without courage. You have lost your right to
survive. <br>
HARRY: (sotto) The Time Ring isn't here, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) What? <br>
HARRY: (sotto) The Time Ring, it's not here. <br>
(Nyder is bending to hear Davros' whispers.) <br>
DAVROS: (sotto) Good. We have achieved the delay we needed. Wait a few
minutes then check that everything is ready. <br>
(Gharman hands his weapon to a colleagues and walks over to Davros.) <br>
GHARMAN: You have heard Davros' case. What he has not made clear is
that there is another way. <br>
DAVROS: There is no other way! <br>
GHARMAN: Production of the Dalek can continue. We can destroy the
genetically conditioned creatures and allow the mutation to follow its
own course. Our race will survive if it deserves to survive, but let it
have all the strengths and weaknesses that we have. Compassion and
hate. Let it do good things and evil. But we cannot let it become an
unfeeling, heartless machine. That is our choice. Now, we must decide. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) We've got to find that Time Ring. <br>
SARAH: (sotto) Doctor. <br>
(Sarah has found it.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Good girl, Sarah. Now all we need is the tape
recording, so keep an eye on Nyder. <br>
DAVROS: You've heard our cases. I will give you two minutes to decide.
Then you must answer not only to me, but to the future. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bunker entrance]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The three Daleks have returned to the bunker,
followed by Bettan and her fighters. They are lined up outside a door.
Nyder whispers to Davros while the Elite confer, and he flicks a
switch. The door opens.) <br>
DALEK: Advance. <br>
(The Daleks head down a corridor. Bettan leads her troops forward.) <br>
BETTAN: Right, bring out the explosives. Now, lay the charges on each
of these main carriers. One charge for each beam should be enough. Are
you quite sure this is the only way into the bunker? <br>
SEVRIN: Well, the only other way was from the Kaled dome, and your war
rocket caved that it. It can never be cleared. <br>
BETTAN: If we do the same here, we'll entomb the Daleks and those who
created them. <br>
SEVRIN: But Sarah and the Doctor are inside. You'll give them a chance
to get clear, won't you? <br>
BETTAN: I must blow the roof as soon as the charges are laid. I can't
delay. If the Daleks find out what we are doing and attack, I don't
have enough men or arms to stand them off. <br>
SEVRIN: How long? <br>
BETTAN: Thirty minutes, perhaps less. <br>
SEVRIN: Then I must get inside and try and warn them. <br>
BETTAN: That's up to you. But you must understand. If you're not back,
I must go on. You'll die in there with them. <br>
SEVRIN: I understand. <br>
BETTAN: I'll give you what time I can. <br>
SEVRIN: Right. </font></p>

who would remain loyal to me and to the future of our race, move
forward and stand at my side. <br>
(Two scientists join Davros.) <br>
DAVROS: No more? Kravos, will you betray me? <br>
DOCTOR: Now I wonder where Nyder's going at such a crucial moment. <br>
HARRY: I think we ought to find out. <br>
DOCTOR: So do I. Let's go. <br>
(The Doctor, Harry and Sarah leave by the door nearest Gharman's desk.)
<br>
DAVROS: Kravos, I saved your life once. In your chest is a tiny
instrument which I designed. It keeps your heart beating. Will you now
turn that heart against me? </font></p>

away, then raises his cosh and the Doctor grabs his arm from behind. In
the struggle both cosh and Time Ring are dropped. The Doctor picks up
the cosh.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now where are you going in such a hurry? <br>
NYDER: Davros has lost. I am getting away while I can. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Somehow that just doesn't ring true. <br>
SARAH: Why didn't you just join the other side? <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's a good question. Do you have a good answer?
Evidently not. Well then, let's try something else. That tape recording
you took, where is it? <br>
NYDER: It's put away in a safe in Davros' office. <br>
DOCTOR: Shall we go and see? <br>
NYDER: Down here. <br>
(They go into a room just before Sevrin comes searching. He dodges the
Daleks and continues on his way.) </font></p>

the middle of a large Elite corps symbol.) <br>

NYDER: Only Davros knows the combination. <br>
HARRY: Come on, Nyder, you can do better than that. <br>
SARAH: Perhaps he's telling the truth. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no. On the contrary. Now, Davros can't rise from his
chair, correct? <br>
NYDER: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: And he has the use of only one hand, this hand. (the right one)
And Davros never goes anywhere without you, Nyder. So you must open the
safe for him. Open it for us. <br>
(Nyder reaches up and opens the safe, then hands the tape to the
Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now let's destroy it. <br>
(Sarah looks around and sees something on a sideboard.) <br>
SARAH: Er, how about this? <br>
DOCTOR: How very apt. A Dalek gun. <br>
(The Doctor puts the tape on the floor and exterminates it. Nyder runs
out of the room.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. <br>
(The door shuts in front of Harry and refuses to open again.) <br>
DOCTOR: He's not important. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: We've got the Time Ring, we've destroyed the tape and Davros'
power is broken. <br>
SARAH: What about the Daleks that are already operational? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I think we can leave Gharman to destroy them. <br>
HARRY: That means we can leave, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, all we've got to do is touch the Time Ring. <br>
(The Doctor pushes up his sleeve and sees his bare arm. Oops.) <br>

is looking down into the laboratory.) <br>

easily. </font></p>

GHARMAN: Why don't you just accept the fact that you have lost. It's
over for you, Davros. <br>
DAVROS: Do you believe that I would let a lifetime's work be ended by
the will of spineless fools like you? You have won nothing. I allowed
this charade to be played out for one reason only. To find those men
who were truly loyal to me and to discover those who would betray me!
(Dalek-like) We, I will go on! <br>
GHARMAN: You are insane, Davros. <br>

are more than three now.) <br>

this on the monitor.) <br>

away. The Dalek trundles over the wires, completing the circuit. The
KaBOOM! is heard at the entrance.) <br>
