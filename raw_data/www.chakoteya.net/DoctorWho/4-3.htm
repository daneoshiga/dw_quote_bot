<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor has regenerated after his ordeal with
the Cybermen and energy-draining Mondas. Ben and Polly watched him
change into a younger person.) <br>
POLLY: His face, his hair, look at it. <br>
BEN: He's breathing, and the Tardis seems to be normal. <br>
POLLY: Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor
there. <br>
BEN: What, him? The Doctor? <br>
POLLY: Well, that's who came through the doors. There was no one else
outside. Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room?
Something about 'This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.' <br>
BEN: So he gets himself a new one? <br>
POLLY: Well, yes. <br>
BEN: Oh, do me a favour. <br>
POLLY: Then whatever happened, happened in here. <br>
BEN: But it's impossible. <br>
POLLY: Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of
things. <br>
(The man on the floor moans and opens his eyes. As he struggles to sit
up, a searing pain nearly cripples him. Clutching his head, he stares
wildly at Ben and Polly, his vision blurred. We hear the thumping of
his headache, or is it heartbeat?) <br>
DOCTOR: Stop. Stop. Concentrate on one thing. One thing. <br>
(The man turns his attention to the Tardis console, focusing on the
controls. The thumping becomes slower and softer. At last his vision
clears. The man removes his hands from his face and looks around him,
his features brightening in relief.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's over. (chuckles) It's over. <br>
(The man scrambles to his feet, wobbling unsteadily. Ben and Polly
watch but make no attempt to help as he circles the Tardis console as
if
reacquainting himself with the controls. His clothes hang off his
slight frame, much too big, and he struggles to unfasten the heavy
cloak that threatens to trip him up. As he does so, an ornate ring
drops to the floor.) <br>
BEN: Doctor? <br>
(As the Tardis engine springs to life and dematerialises, the man
raises his hands to his face once more, feeling his features as if they
belonged to a stranger. Polly moves to pick up the fallen ring, eyeing
the newcomer with open curiosity and a little unease. The little man
makes his way over to a storage chest, his stiff-legged gait reminding
Polly of a small child learning to walk. He trips, but recovers
quickly.) <br>
DOCTOR: The muscles are still a bit tight. <br>
BEN: What are we going to do? <br>
POLLY: It is the Doctor. I know it is. I think. <br>
BEN: It's not only his face that's changed. He doesn't even act like
him. <br>
(The stranger is rummaging through the contents of the chest.) <br>
BEN: Come on, it's time we sorted this out. Now look here! <br>
DOCTOR: Hold that. <br>
(He hands Ben a mirror.) <br>
DOCTOR: Tilt it. <br>
(The man gazes intently at his reflection. The face in the mirror has a
mop of black hair and dark green eyes. Momentarily the image blurs and
changes to that of an older, white-haired man before changing back
again. Apparently satisfied, the man turns his attention back to the
storage chest.) <br>
BEN: Have you done with this? <br>
DOCTOR: Put it down. Put it down. <br>
BEN: Now what's the game? <br>
(The man turns, cheerfully brandishing an ornamental dagger.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! The Crusades, from Saladin. The Doctor was a great
collector, wasn't he? <br>
POLLY: But you're the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't look like him. <br>
BEN: Who are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you know? <br>
(The man rummages further and pulls out a piece of dull silver metal.
His look of mischief fades as the object triggers a very clear memory.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Extermination. <br>
(The man stuffs the metal into his pocket. His concern turns to delight
as he unearths a magnifying glass. He begins a careful study of his
hands.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Very good. Nails need growing. <br>
(Ben takes the Doctor's ring from Polly.) <br>
BEN: Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should
fit now, shouldn't it? <br>
(And slips it on the man's finger. It's far too big.) <br>
BEN: There. That settles it. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after
it's spread its wings. <br>
POLLY: Then you did change! <br>
DOCTOR: Life depends on change and renewal. <br>
BEN: Oh, so that's it. You've been renewed, have you? <br>
DOCTOR: I've been renewed, have I? That's it. I've been renewed. It's
part of the Tardis. Without it, I couldn't survive. Come here. <br>
(Unexpectedly, the man rounds on Polly.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come here. <br>
(Still rather nervous of this strange interloper, Polly steps closer.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he? <br>
POLLY: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought so. I wonder where. I wonder where. <br>
(Ben and Polly watch as the man resumes his search of the chest.) <br>
POLLY: He's a very different Doctor, Ben. <br>
BEN: Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though? <br>
(The man has found something else in the chest. A descant recorder. He
removes it with great care and stands flexing his fingers over the
holes. His expression is one of pure child-like joy, and convinces
Polly that it's time for her to trust her instincts about the man's
identity. He plays a little tune and dances a jig, stopping when he
spots the missing diary.) <br>
POLLY: Doctor? <br>
(Tucking the recorder into his jacket, the Doctor begins to read.) <br>
POLLY: Doctor, what's going to happen to us? <br>
DOCTOR: I think. I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's
time we went for a stroll. <br>
(The Doctor grabs a stove-pipe hat from the chest. Engrossed in his
reading, he moves to the console and opens the Tardis doors.) <br>
POLLY: But you don't know where we've landed! <br>
BEN: No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!
<br>
DOCTOR: (still reading the diary) Oxygen density 172, radiation nil,
temperature 86. Strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben?
Now, are you two coming or are you not? <br>
POLLY: He does know us. He said Ben. Didn't you hear him? <br>
BEN: Yeah, I heard. But he might just have been copying you though,
mightn't he?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Mercury swamp]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis has landed in a misty swamp. The ground
is rocky and pitted with small bubbling pools which occasionally spray
a fine silver mist into the air. The Doctor wanders away, still
fascinated by the contents of the diary. Strolling directly towards a
small pool of mercury, he is apparently oblivious to any danger, yet
manages to successfully circumnavigate the obstacle without once
looking up from his reading. Suddenly realising what he's done, he
stops and looks back, delighted at having outwitted the obstruction and
laughs. But then he looks down and sloshes out of the watery puddle in
which he is now standing.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you coming, you two? <br>
(The Doctor continues on his way. After a short distance he stops once
more. A boulder blocks his path. Pulling a tape measure from his
pocket, he takes some extensive measurements of the rock, and scribbles
some calculations on an empty page of the diary. The Doctor glances
round him. The boulder stands in a clearing and he could easily walk
round it, but a look of mischief crosses his face. Backing up a few
steps, the Doctor looks down at his legs, flexing his knees.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time I put you through some tests, I think. <br>
(Breaking into a run, the Doctor successfully leap-frogs the boulder.) <br>
EXAMINER: Hello? <br>
(A newcomer has entered the clearing.) <br>
EXAMINER: Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello? Hello? Why don't they
come? (sees the Doctor) Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm
the Examiner. <br>
(There's a gun shot. The man crumples to the ground. Horrified, the
Doctor's about to dive for cover then pauses and, keeping low,
approaches the fallen figure. He rolls the man over, and sees that he
is dead. Searching for some kind of identification, the Doctor finds a
large round badge. Automatically reaching into his top pocket he pulls
out a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and puts them on. He squints at
the badge and moves it backwards and forwards, trying to focus on it,
yet all he can see is a misty blur. He removes the spectacles and tries
again. This time the text is clear.) <br>
DOCTOR: Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. <br>
(Behind the Doctor, a figure looms out of the mist, wearing an
all-concealing white suit and goggles. The figure trains a pistol on
the Doctor's back.) <br>
BEN: Doctor, where are you? <br>
(The Doctor turns. The figure dodges out of sight. Close to the Tardis,
Ben and Polly are exploring the swamp.) <br>
BEN: Phwoar, ain't it hot. <br>
POLLY: Do you think the air's like this everywhere? <br>
BEN: Nah, might be just around here. Don't want too many lungfuls of
it, I know that. Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a
brewery. You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go. <br>
POLLY: It's beautiful. <br>
BEN: No, don't touch it, Polly. <br>
POLLY: I wasn't going to. <br>
BEN: No, it's quicksilver. It gets through the pores. Where is the
Doctor, or whatever he is, got to? <br>
(As Ben moves away, a cloud of mercury vapour catches Polly full in the
face. She coughs.) <br>
BEN: What's the matter? Hey, Polly! Hey, Doctor, wherever you are.
Quick, there's something happening to Polly! <br>
(The Doctor heads back to the Tardis at a run.) <br>
BEN: Quick! Over this way! <br>
(Pistol raised as a bludgeon, the suited figure steps out behind the
Doctor and knocks him down. The Doctor grabs at the figure briefly
before sinking to the ground, unconscious. Working quickly, the
stranger presses something into the Doctor's palm then drags the
Examiner's body away. The Doctor is left sprawled on the ground, a
button clutched in his outstretched hand.) <br>
(Meanwhile, Ben is trying to drag the unconscious Polly to safety.
Another cloud of mercury vapour rises from the pool.) <br>
BEN: Doctor! <br>
(The last thing Ben sees before he passes out, is a white suited figure
holding a pistol approaching fast.) <br>
(Some time later, a young man in a white survival suit, goggles pushed
up over his head, is kneeling besides the seemingly
unconscious Doctor. Another older man, similarly attired, approaches.) <br>
BRAGEN: Ah, Quinn, there you are. What have you got there? My people
have found two more of them by one of the pools. <br>
QUINN: This one's got a nasty bruise on the back of his head. Fallen
over his feet and knocked himself out, I suppose. <br>
BRAGEN: I suppose so. <br>
QUINN: Why don't they use the kit we send them? <br>
BRAGEN: Yes. The other two have had a rather bad dose of fumes. The
girl has, anyway. <br>
QUINN: Girl? <br>
BRAGEN: Yes, but she'll recover. <br>
(Ben and Polly are helped into the clearing by two guards.) <br>
QUINN: These comic opera guards of yours do have some uses after all. <br>
BRAGEN: I pick them for their physical fitness. <br>
QUINN: I thought it wasn't for their IQ. Give me a hand with the
Examiner, will you. <br>
BRAGEN: I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan?
Just now, I mean. <br>
QUINN: I don't know. <br>
BRAGEN: It's a mystery, isn't it? He isn't due for another two years. <br>
(Ben is recovering.) <br>
QUINN: How do you feel? <br>
BEN: (cough) Urgh. <br>
QUINN: We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area. <br>
BEN: Ay? <br>
QUINN: Don't worry. Most of the ships from Earth do over-shoot. I'm
Quinn, Deputy Governor. <br>
BRAGEN: Bragen, Head of Security. <br>
QUINN: Let's get them all back, shall we? I'll take the girl. <br>
BRAGEN: Here, you two, help carry the Examiner. <br>
(The guards lift the Doctor between them.) <br>
BRAGEN: I suppose you Earth people can't wait to examine Lesterson's
space capsule? <br>
BEN: Ay? <br>
(Ben is startled as the Doctor winks slyly at him.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lesterson's laboratory]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Lesterson is polishing an oddly shaped piece of
metal. A huge space capsule dominates one side of the room. Lesterson's
assistant, Janley, joins him.) <br>
JANLEY: (a woman) Lesterson. <br>
LESTERSON: Look at this. <br>
JANLEY: They've just brought in an Examiner from Earth, and a couple of
assistants. <br>
LESTERSON: An Examiner? What's he here for? <br>
JANLEY: I thought you'd know. <br>
LESTERSON: It's the capsule, it must be. Well, they can't stop me
working on it, I'll tell you that. <br>
JANLEY: Could anyone? <br>
LESTERSON: The Governor's always been difficult about it. But surely
they wouldn't send somebody all the way from Earth just <br>
JANLEY: Look, what about the meeting? <br>
LESTERSON: Meeting? <br>
JANLEY: Yes. I've arranged everything. Can we still use the old rocket
room? <br>
LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so. But I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up
with these pressure groups, Janley. <br>
JANLEY: Well, somebody has to do something. The colony's running down
and you know it. <br>
LESTERSON: I'm too busy. <br>
JANLEY: But if we ran things, you'd have better facilities, more money.
I wish you'd take an interest. <br>
LESTERSON: Now look, I don't mind letting you have the use of one of my
rooms now and again, Janley, but don't try to involve me. This is what
I find important. Two hundred years in a mercury swamp and this piece
of metal that dropped from it? Look, a couple of minutes polishing and
it's as good as new. <br>
JANLEY: Wonderful. <br>
LESTERSON: Rain, damp, heat, mercury. Nothing touches this metal. No
corrosion, Janley. Think of that. <br>
JANLEY: Well, I hope the Examiner lets you go on with your experiment.
Frankly, I doubt it. I think the Governor's brought the Examiner here
to stop you opening the capsule. You should join our group, Lesterson.
You might need us one day. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Guest quarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Fully recovered, the Doctor, Ben and Polly have
been left to make themselves comfortable. The Doctor is plays on his
recorder.) <br>
BEN: So the murdered man was the real Examiner? <br>
(Nodding, the Doctor blows a pair of notes.) <br>
BEN: Well, did you see who did it? <br>
(Top note screech.) <br>
POLLY: The Doctor got this button though. <br>
BEN: I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't
just go back to the Tardis. <br>
POLLY: Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real
Examiner? <br>
(Two notes repeated.) <br>
POLLY: Won't that be dangerous? <br>
(Two notes again.) <br>
BEN: Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us
properly? <br>
POLLY: Ben! <br>
BEN: Now don't you start. It's bad enough with him. <br>
POLLY: Well, he hasn't done anything. <br>
BEN: No, that's just the trouble. <br>
(Ben snatches the recorder away.) <br>
BEN: He knows what happened back at the Tardis, yet will he tell us?
Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor? <br>
(Ben blows angrily into the recorder. There is a knock on the door.) <br>
BEN: Come in! <br>
(Two guards in peaked caps and dark uniforms enter, with Bragen and a
large bearded man in his late fifties.) <br>
HENSELL: I am Hensell, the Governor. I trust you're all feeling much
better? <br>
BEN: I've felt worse, Governor. The Governor. <br>
HENSELL: If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming, we might
possibly have been able to guide you down to the landing area. <br>
DOCTOR: If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must
have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was? <br>
HENSELL: Now look here, I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you
have come to Vulcan. What is your brief? <br>
DOCTOR: I am the Examiner. <br>
HENSELL: Why are you here? <br>
DOCTOR: To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once. <br>
(The Doctor darts forward and begins to examine Bragen's tunic.) <br>
HENSELL: Someone's leaked reports about these Rebel groups. That's it,
isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Your turn now, Governor. <br>
(The Doctor turns his attention to Hensell's clothing.) <br>
BRAGEN: There is Lesterson's capsule. <br>
HENSELL: Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't
interfere. <br>
DOCTOR: Please go on. <br>
HENSELL: The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have
been here for centuries. <br>
DOCTOR: Interesting. Continue. <br>
HENSELL: For centuries before the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might
be dangerous. It might contain bacteria. <br>
DOCTOR: I shall examine the capsule later. You may leave us. <br>
HENSELL: I shall look forward to your report. Bragen, see that the
Examiner and his party get some proper clothes, will you? <br>
(Hensell, Bragen, and the guards leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: We are wearing proper clothes. <br>
(The Doctor starts playing again.) <br>
BEN: Oh, how did he get that thing back again. That was a bit of a
cheek, wasn't it, seeing if the Governor was the guy you got the button
off? <br>
POLLY: Doctor? When he was talking to you, you were staring at the
other man. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it. Terrible manners. To tell you
the truth, I was studying his reaction, seeing if he agreed with the
story. <br>
BEN: Did he? <br>
DOCTOR: Must have a look at that capsule. <br>
BEN: Now, you want to watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit
too far. <br>
DOCTOR: Our answers must come from that mercury swamp. <br>
BEN: 'Cause at least one bloke ain't going to be fooled. <br>
DOCTOR: When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule. <br>
BEN: Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner
in! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A little later Bragen, accompanied by a guard, is
posting a notice on a board. Quinn approaches.) <br>
QUINN: Bragen! What's all this nonsense about having to have a pass to
see the Examiner? <br>
BRAGEN: It's the Governor's idea. <br>
QUINN: Surely it doesn't apply to me? <br>
BRAGEN: It's not my order, Quinn. I expect the Governor wants to keep
people away from him. <br>
QUINN: It sounded like one of your red-tape ideas. <br>
BRAGEN: It had nothing to do with me. <br>
QUINN: Right! <br>
(Quinn strides away, practically colliding with Janley.) <br>
JANLEY: Oh! <br>
QUINN: Sorry, Janley. <br>
JANLEY: My fault. <br>
QUINN: Are you all right? <br>
JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's just cleared me out of his lab. Is the
Examiner going to let him open the capsule? <br>
QUINN: I don't know. I'm on my way there now, if I can push past
Bragen's army of
lay-abouts. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lesterson's laboratory]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Later that evening, the Doctor takes Ben and Polly
to see the space capsule. The Doctor spots the piece of metal that
Lesterson was polishing earlier. He picks it up and examines it,
worriedly.) <br>
DOCTOR: Where did you get this? <br>
LESTERSON: It dropped from the capsule. <br>
DOCTOR: Dropped? <br>
LESTERSON: Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you
can see, this metal could revolutionise space travel. That's why I'm
insisting that we open it. Well, who knows what other marvels there may
be inside? <br>
HENSELL: But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it. <br>
LESTERSON: Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening
mechanism on the other side is either here, or here. <br>
(While Lesterson is occupied, the Doctor pulls out the piece of metal
he found in the Tardis and compares the two. They are identical.) <br>
DOCTOR: Extermination. <br>
LESTERSON: Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this
ridge here. The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in. <br>
HENSELL: Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility. <br>
DOCTOR: A laser. Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult. <br>
(The laser fires at the first spot. Nothing happens.) <br>
LESTERSON: Well, we'll try the other side. <br>
(Lesterson refocuses the laser. A mechanism engages and the hatchway
slides open. The Doctor and Lesterson step into the capsule.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Capsule entry]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A small brightly lit chamber. The Doctor studies
the far wall. Everyone else crowds in.) <br>
LESTERSON: Hmm. It's a bit disappointing. <br>
DOCTOR: Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it. <br>
LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so. <br>
HENSELL: Well, this doesn't get us very far, does it? <br>
LESTERSON: Getting into the rest of the capsule will take time,
Governor. <br>
BEN: Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an
opening door. <br>
LESTERSON: I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock
mechanism is. <br>
DOCTOR: I think we'll leave if for tonight. <br>
HENSELL: Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for? <br>
DOCTOR: That is my decision, Governor. <br>
HENSELL: But good heavens above, man. <br>
DOCTOR: A hundred years you say this has been buried? <br>
LESTERSON: Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner
compartment. We shall be able to find out where it came from
originally. <br>
DOCTOR: It didn't come from this planet Vulcan. <br>
LESTERSON: Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien. <br>
DOCTOR: Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight. <br>
(The Doctor leaves the laboratory.) <br>
BEN: What's he up to now? <br>
POLLY: Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HENSELL: Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it
worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner? <br>
LESTERSON: I didn't send for him. I thought you did. <br>
QUINN: Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell. I can find
out what's he's here for. <br>
HENSELL: No, no, no, no. You keep away from him. We'll leave him to
work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to
worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering. <br>
QUINN: But with five minutes <br>
HENSELL: You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the
Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as
you keep his nose out of our business. <br>
LESTERSON: Yes. All right. <br>
HENSELL: All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow. <br>
(Once he's alone, Lesterson returns to his workbench where he quickly
realises that his metal sample has disappeared.)

of the pieces of metal into a narrow opening. An inner door slides
open, revealing a second compartment. The Doctor edges forward, peering
into the gloom. Two shapes are silhouetted against the dull metal glow.
Familiar, giant pepperpot shapes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks. <br>
BEN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The Daleks. <br>

look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it? <br>

a lamp with a long lead and drags it back into the capsule, unaware

Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the
colony. <br>
DALEK: I am your servant. <br>
LESTERSON: It, it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk.

efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without
mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It
destroys them. <br>

DALEK: When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice
versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable. <br>
(As the Dalek gives the answer, the Doctor slips the modified control
unit from his pocket and connects it to the generator.) <br>
DALEK: That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is
equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced. <br>

ready to take over. <br>
KEBBLE: What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've
been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered. <br>
JANLEY: Valmar. <br>
VALMAR: Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered.
I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate
the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose. <br>
JANLEY: Shall we have the demonstration now? <br>

KEBBLE: But you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us. <br>
JANLEY: No, it won't. <br>
KEBBLE: I wouldn't let any of my group go anywhere near it. <br>
VALMAR: I can control it. <br>
KEBBLE: Prove it. Ah, you daren't! I'm not talking about that thing
firing at the wall or bits of metal or anything. I mean people. Have
you tested whether you can stop it from killing people? Our people? <br>
VALMAR: Look, I can show you what I've done here. <br>
KEBBLE: Forget it. How do you know a Dalek can tell the difference
between the Governor's people and our people? <br>

DALEK: I obey. <br>
DOCTOR: You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in
front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him? <br>
BRAGEN: The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor. <br>
DOCTOR: An impostor? How do you propose to prove that? <br>
BRAGEN: My guards are now going to produce the body of the real
Examiner from the mercury swamp. <br>
DOCTOR: The one you murdered. <br>
BRAGEN: The one you pretended to be. <br>
DOCTOR: Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation. <br>
BRAGEN: Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that

rebels are well organised. <br>
QUINN: The Governor's popular. He can count on the mine workers at the
perimeter for support. <br>
DOCTOR: In that case we must get word to him. <br>
QUINN: If you'd done your job properly, Examiner, you wouldn't be here

DOCTOR: Ah yes, but then I'm not the real Examiner. <br>

revolt, then he can finish them off. <br>
DOCTOR: The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every
human being on this planet. <br>
POLLY: Doctor, oh please, let's go back to the Tardis. <br>

but is also killed. The Doctor grabs Kebble and they run off. The Dalek
follows.) </font></p>

VALMAR: Don't come any nearer. <br>
JANLEY: What do you mean? <br>
VALMAR: I overheard your conversation with Bragen. But you can't stand
up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing. <br>
JANLEY: Not my plan. Bragen's. <br>
VALMAR: But that's the same thing. <br>
JANLEY: Not any more. <br>
VALMAR: You expect me to believe that? <br>
JANLEY: Look, Val, he was going to kill me too. I came here to do
exactly what you've done. Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He
doesn't know how strong they are. He's got to be stopped. <br>
DALEK: You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings. <br>
VALMAR: Yes. <br>

DOCTOR: The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got

going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking. <br>
BEN: Where do they get their power from, Lesterson? <br>
LESTERSON: Ah, I tried to turn the power off, but they were miles ahead
of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them. <br>
BEN: But we've got to stop them! <br>
LESTERSON: Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you
see, taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now. <br>

LESTERSON: Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one
of her men, Valmar, I think it was, yes, and he rigged up a secret
cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply. <br>
DOCTOR: Where? Where is it, Lesterson? <br>
LESTERSON: Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of

can do for her. <br>
VALMAR: The main cable's inside the capsule, but there's nothing you
can do. <br>
QUINN: There must be some way of cutting off the power! <br>

pushes every button in sight. Valmar gets through the door just before
the Daleks shoot. Ben pulls Polly out of sight. There's an explosion
and the Doctor is knocked down. The Daleks lose control, lights
flashing and smoke coming from their casings. One powers into the wall
