Donna Noble, walk along different streets to the same glass fronted

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A woman is giving a presentation to an audience of
several dozen.) <br>
FOSTER: Adipose Industries, the twenty first century way to lose
weight. No exercise, no diet, no pain. Just lifelong freedom from fat.
The Holy Grail of the modern age. And here it is. You just take one
capsule. One capsule, once a day for three weeks, and the fat, as they
say. <br>
(The film takes over.) <br>
NARRATOR [OC]: The fat just walks away. <br>
(A woman in the audience speaks.) <br>
PENNY: Excuse me, Miss Foster. If I could? I'm Penny Carter, science
correspondent for The Observer. There are a thousand diet pills on the
market, a thousand con men stealing people's money. How do we know the
fat isn't going straight into your bank account? <br>
FOSTER: Oh, Penny, if cynicism burnt up calories, we'd all be as thin
as rakes. But if you want the science, I can oblige. <br>
(Donna is also in the audience.) <br>
NARRATOR [OC]: Adipose Industries. The Adipose capsule is composed of a
synthesised mobilising lipase, bound to a large protein molecule.

percent effective. <br>
PENNY: But, can I just ask, how many people have taken the pills to
date? <br>
FOSTER: We've already got one million customers within the Greater
London area alone, but from next week, we start rolling out nationwide.
The future starts here. And Britain will be thin.

PEOPLE: Good morning. I represent Adipose Industries. <br>
(Donna sits down next to a man in a cubicle.) <br>
CRAIG: That's a three week course of pills for a special price of forty
five pounds. <br>
DONNA: (sotto) Donna Noble, Health and Safety. Don't mind me. <br>
(The Doctor finds a young woman.) <br>
CLARE: We deliver within three working days. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) John Smith, Health and Safety. Don't mind me. <br>
CRAIG: The box comes with 21 days worth of pills, a full information
pack, and our special free gift, an Adipose Industries pendant. <br>
(Donna looks at the pendant - a gold plated Adpiose pill. The Doctor
does the same.) <br>
CLARE: It's made of eighteen carat gold, and it's yours for free. No,
we don't give away pens, sorry. No, I can't make an exception, no. <br>
DONNA: I'll just need to keep this for testing. And I just need a list
of your customers. Could you print it off? <br>
CRAIG: I suppose so. <br>
DONNA: Where's the printer? <br>
CRAIG: Just over there, by the plant. <br>
(Donna looks of the cubicle wall.) <br>
DONNA: Which plant, that plant? <br>
CRAIG: Yeah, that's the one. <br>
DONNA: Lovely. <br>
(She sits down, and up pops the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's the printer there? <br>
CLARE: By the plant, yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Brilliant. <br>
(Down he goes and up comes Donna.) <br>
DONNA: Does it need a code? Last place I worked, the printer needed a
code. <br>
CRAIG: No, I can do it from here. <br>
(They swap over.) <br>
DOCTOR: Has it got paper? <br>
CLARE: Yeah, Jimbo keeps it stocked. <br>
(Miss Foster walks in with two guards.) <br>
FOSTER: Excuse me, everyone, if I could have your attention. <br>
(The workers stand.) <br>
FOSTER: On average, you're each selling forty Adipose packs per day.
It's not enough. I want one hundred sales per person per day. And if
not, you'll be replaced. Because if anyone's good in trimming the fat,
it's me. Now. Back to it. <br>
(Miss Foster leaves and the workers sit down again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Anyway, if you could print that off. Thanks. <br>
DONNA: So if you could just print off that list, I'll get out of your
way. Lovely. Thanks, then. See you. <br>
(Donna heads for the printer. The Doctor stands then sits again as
Clare gives him a piece of paper.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thanks, then. Oh, what's that? <br>
CLARE: My telephone number. <br>
DOCTOR: What for? <br>
CLARE: Health and Safety. You be health, I'll be safety. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Ah. But that contravenes er, paragraph five, subsection C.
Sorry. <br>
(Donna collects the printouts and leaves. The Doctor walks behind her
to the printer and looks for his copies, then returns to Clare.) <br>
DOCTOR: Me again.

on Thursday. Five days later, I've lost eleven pounds. <br>
DONNA: And no side effects or anything? <br>
STACY: No, I feel fantastic. It's a new lease of life. Now, what do you
think about these earrings. Do they work? <br>
DONNA: Yeah, lovely.

I've lost fourteen kilos. <br>
DOCTOR: That's the same amount every day? <br>
ROGER: One kilo exactly. You wake up, and it's disappeared overnight.
Well, technically speaking, it's gone by ten past one in the morning. <br>
DOCTOR: What makes you say that? <br>
ROGER: That's when I get woken up. Might as well weigh myself at the
same time.

every night, bang on the dot without fail, the burglar alarm goes off.
I've had experts in, I've had it replaced, I've even phoned Watchdog.
But no, ten past one in the morning, off it goes. <br>
DOCTOR: But with no burglars? <br>
ROGER: Nothing. I've given up looking. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, Roger. Have you got a cat flap? <br>
(That's a yes.) <br>
ROGER: It was here when I bought the house. I've never bothered with
it, really. I'm not a cat person. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I've met cat people. You're nothing like them. <br>
ROGER: It's that what it is, though? Cats getting inside the house? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, thing about cat flaps is, they don't just let things in,
they let things out as well. <br>

DOCTOR: The fat just walks away.

it absentmindedly and Stacy's stomach growls. As Donna twiddles with
the gold capsule, Stacey's abdomen moves around.)

He has to hit it a few times. The van arrives outside Stacy's home as
Donna leaves by the back door and goes down the alleyway. The trail of
knocked over dustbins tells her which way the creatures have gone. The
men from the van have used butterfly nets to collect the creatures, put
them into containers and then the back of the van. They drive away past
Donna, and nearly knock down the Doctor. He starts chasing it. A taxi
pulls up by Donna.) <br>

the capsule bio-tunes itself to it's owner, but someone must have
introduced a second raw capsule. Therefore, one of these people is a
thief. There, oh yes, there she is. Now, what shall we do with her?

DONNA: How old am I? <br>
SYLVIA: Not old enough to use a phone. <br>

drink.) <br>
SYLVIA: I thought you were only moving back for a couple of weeks. Look
at you. I mean, you're never gonna find a flat, not while you're on the
dole. And its no good sitting there, dressed up, looking like you're
job hunting. You've got to do something. It's not like the 1980s. No
one's unemployed these days except you. How long did that job with
Health and Safety last? Two days, and then you walk out. I have other
plans. Well, I've not seen them. And it's no good sitting there
dreaming. No one's
going to come along with a magic wand and make your life all better. <br>

is also a small telescope and a camp stool nearby. Donna walks up with

DONNA: Big time. Brought you a thermos. <br>

DONNA: You seen anything? <br>
WILF: Yeah, I've got Venus, there with an apparent magnitude of minus
three point five. At least, that's what it says in my little book. <br>

WILF: Here, come and see. Come on. Here you go. Right? <br>
(Donna looks at the bright evening star.) <br>
WILF: That's the only planet in the Solar System named after a woman. <br>
DONNA: Good for her. How far away is that? <br>
WILF: Oh, its about twenty six million miles. But we'll get there, one
day. In a hundred years time we'll be striding out amongst the stars.
Jiggling about with all them aliens. Just you wait. <br>
DONNA: You really believe in all that stuff, don't you? <br>
WILF: It's all over the place these days. If I wait here long enough. <br>
DONNA: I don't suppose you've seen a little blue box? <br>
WILF: Is that slang for something? <br>
DONNA: No, I mean it. If you ever see a little blue box flying up there
in the sky, you shout for me, Gramps. Oh, you just shout. <br>
WILF: Do you know, I don't understand half the things you say these
days. <br>
DONNA: Nor me. <br>
WILF: No, fair dos. You've had a funny old time of it lately. There was
poor old what's his name, Lance, bless him, and that barmy old
Christmas. I wish you'd tell us what really happened. <br>
DONNA: I know. It's just, the things I've seen, sometimes I think I'm
going mad. I mean, even tonight I was in a. Doesn't matter. <br>
WILF: Well, you're not yourself, I'll give you that. You just, you seem
to be drifting, sweetheart. <br>
DONNA: I'm not drifting. I'm waiting. <br>
WILF: What for? <br>
DONNA: The right man. <br>
WILF: Same old story. A man! <br>
DONNA: No, I don't mean like that. But, he's real. I've seen him. I've
met him, just once, and then I let him fly away. <br>
WILF: Well, there you are. Go and find him. <br>
DONNA: I've tried. He's nowhere. <br>
WILF: Oi, not like you to give up. Do you know, I remember when you
were about six years old, your mother said no holiday this year. So off
you toddled, all on your own and you got on a bus to Strathclyde. Ha!
We had the police after you and everything. Ha, where's she gone, then.
Where's that girl, hey? <br>
DONNA: You're right. Because he's still out there, somewhere. And I'll
find him, Gramps. Even if I have to wait a hundred years, I'll find
him.

see it printed. This (a capsule) is the spark of life. <br>
PENNY: And what's that supposed to mean? <br>
FOSTER: Officially, the capsule attracts all the fat cells and flushes
them away. Well, it certainly attracts them. That part's true. But it
binds the fat together and galvanises it to form a body. <br>
