note - Shada (pronounced Shah-da) was not fully made, due to union
action at the BBC, and never broadcast apart from the sequence of the
Doctor and Romana punting on the River Cam and a bit of chase scene
which was used in the Five Doctors.) The existing footage was released
on videotape with linking narration by Tom Baker filmed in the Doctor
Who area of the Museum Of The Moving Image, which sadly closed in 1999.
In 2003, Big Finish Productions made an audio version with Paul McGann, and the BBC created a 
<a href="17-6.htm"><font color="#000000"> live action / animation version</a> for DVD in 2017.</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: Hello? Hello? Hello. Anybody there? Way, it's
a museum. I've always felt at home in museums. Giant Robot. Beat you,
cock. Cybermen, beat you. Daleks, beat you. Davros. Davros. Phew, I
beat him as well. I was irresistible in those days. Irresistible. Yeti.
Gunden Robot. No, no, no, no. Vervoid, Sea Devil, Ice Warrior, Krarg.
Krarg? Shada! The untransmitted story. Why wasn't it transmitted? Of
course, we didn't finish it. Starring Denis Carey and Christopher
Neame, written by Douglas Adams. I thought it was a very good script
and there was an invisible spaceship. Douglas said anybody can design a
visible spaceship but to design an invisible spaceship, that needs
imagination. I think he said that, or did he say? I think he said
genius. Yes, he said genius. Poor old Douglas, I wonder what became of
him? That's right, Cambridge, about 1979. Punting on the Cam. There was
a choir on the corner as I biked by, singing Faure's Requiem or some
train song or other. Daniel Hill. I'd heard he become the manager of a
old people's home. <i>(Yes, he played Harvey Baines opposite
Graham
Crowden in Waiting for God.)</i> Or maybe he went into an old
people home,
I can't remember. Or maybe he was always old, I don't know. And
Victoria Burgoyne. It was her first television and when she heard it
was cancelled, she was so unhappy. She cried a lot. We all cried a lot.
We were very sad. Shada. Shada. Shada.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Inside a space station hanging by a red giant
star, six men dressed in white sit in recliners with their heads
towards a central device with a globe on it. Very Alien. A monitor
starts counting down in roman numerals, from XXX. One of the men is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623762/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Christopher
Neame</a>, who is dressed slightly differently from the others,
and has a nasty scar down his right cheek. When the countdown finishes,
his eyes open. Another count begins, this time going upwards. The other
five men start jerking in their seats while our man gets up and goes to
a wall panel, where he presses some buttons. The men stop jerking, and
voices begin whispering. Eventually they become still. Our man walks to
a control console and flicks some switches. A male voice comes from the
speakers.) <br>
COMPUTER [OC]: This is a recorded message. The Foundation for the Study
for Advanced Sciences is under strict quarantine. Do not approach. Do
not approach. Everything is under our control. <br>
(The man holds up his hand, and the sphere from the top of device rises
into the air and glides into it. He leaves. The computer repeats its
message as the man goes into the shuttlebay. Then the five remaining
men jerk briefly and get up. They stagger around like automata as a
spaceship undocks and flies away.)

black academic gown is unpacking a briefcase. He unwinds his scarf and
removes the gown to reveal a slightly tatty jacket underneath. His
study is lined from floor to ceiling with bookshelves, and the tables
are also loaded with volumes. A police telephone box sits somewhat out
of place amongst it all. The Professor looks at it, then goes and draws
his curtains. There is a knock at the door.)&nbsp;<br>

off to the kitchen.) <br>

PARSONS: Professor Chronotis? <br>
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Tea? <br>
PARSONS: Oh, thanks. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Just put the kettle on. <br>
PARSONS: Er, Professor Chronotis, I don't know if you remember me. We
met at a faculty party a few weeks ago. It's Chris Parsons. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, of course. Enjoy these faculty dos, do you? <br>
PARSONS: Well, you know. <br>
CHRONOTIS: A lot of boring old dons talking away at each other, who
never listen to a word anybody else says. <br>
PARSONS: No, well, you said that <br>
CHRONOTIS: Talk, talk, talk. Never listen. <br>
PARSONS: No, well, er, look, I hope I'm not taking up any of your
valuable <br>
CHRONOTIS: Time? Oh no. When you get to my age, you'll find that time
doesn't matter too much. Not that I expect you'll get to my age. <br>
PARSONS: Oh, really? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes, I remember talking to the last Master of College but
one, or was it the last Master but two? Could have been three. <br>
PARSONS: Three? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes, nice young chap. Died rather tragically at the age of
oh. Run over by a coach and pair. <br>
PARSONS: What was it you said to him? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh, I don't know. Long time ago, you know. <br>
PARSONS: Yes. Professor, when we met you were kind enough to say that
if I dropped round you would lend me some of your books on carbon
dating. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh yes, of course. Happy to. Ah, there's the kettle. You'll
find the books you want at the far end of this shelf. Third shelf down.
<br>
PARSONS: Thanks. <br>
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Or is it the second shelf down? Second, I think.
Anyway, take what you want. Milk? <br>
PARSONS: Oh, yes please. <br>
CHRONOTIS [OC]: One lump or two? <br>
PARSONS: Two please. <br>
CHRONOTIS [OC]: Sugar? <br>
(Chronotis enters with two china cups of tea on a tray.) <br>
CHRONOTIS: Ah, Here we are. <br>
(Parsons tucks his selected books under his arm and looks at his wrist
watch.) <br>
PARSONS: Oh, actually Professor, I've just realised I'm going to be
really late for a seminar. Look, I'm terribly sorry. Look, I'll bring
these back to you next week, all right? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes, of course. Goodbye. <br>
PARSONS: Goodbye. Actually, Professor, could I just ask you, where did
you get that? <br>
(He points to the Tardis.) <br>
CHRONOTIS: Oh, I don't know. I think someone must have left it there
when I was out. <br>
PARSONS: Yes, well, I'll bring these back as soon as I can. <br>

is reading a book.) <br>
DOCTOR: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvel, Judge
Jefferies, Owen Chadwick. <br>
ROMANA: Who? <br>
DOCTOR: Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes. Some of the greatest labourers in the
history of Earth have thought here. <br>
ROMANA: Newton, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, definitely Newton. <br>
ROMANA: For every action, there is a equal and opposite reaction. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. <br>
ROMANA: So Newton invented punting. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius. <br>
ROMANA: Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so <br>
DOCTOR: Restful? <br>
ROMANA: No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in
the other. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, colours. <br>
DOCTOR: It's October. <br>
ROMANA: I thought that you said we were coming here for May week. <br>
DOCTOR: I did. May week's in June. <br>
ROMANA: I'm confused. <br>
DOCTOR: So was the Tardis. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing
can go wrong. No coordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just
the water, a punt, a strong pair of hands and the pole. <br>
(Whereupon the pole gets stuck in the mud of the riverbed and the
Doctor has to let it go. They drift on under a bridge.) <br>
ROMANA: The pole. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, I think it's about time that we go and see if the Professor
is back in his room. Ask me how. <br>
(The man from the spacestation watches them drift under the bridge. He
has a large carpet bag with him, and has acquired a large white hat and
cloak to complete a Renaissance look.) <br>
ROMANA: How? <br>
DOCTOR: For every reaction there is an opposite and equally different
action. <br>
(The whisper of many voices is briefly heard before he walks away.) <br>
ROMANA: Did you just heard voices? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
(The Doctor has found a paddle.) </font></p>

been an historian. <br>
ROMANA: I am an historian. <br>

WILKIN: Good afternoon, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Wilkin! You remembered me. <br>
WILKIN: Why, yes, of course, sir. An honorary degree in 1960. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but how kind of you to remember me. <br>
WILKIN: That's my job, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: And you do it splendidly. Now <br>
WILKIN: Professor Chronotis, sir? He returned to his room a few minutes
ago. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh good, good, good. Wilkin, how did you know I wanted to speak
to Professor Chronotis? <br>
WILKIN: Because that's who you asked for when you were here in 1964,
1960 and 1955, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Did I really? I was here in 1958. <br>
WILKIN: Were you, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but in a different body. <br>
WILKIN: Yes, sir. <br>

CHRONOTIS: Oh, delighted, delighted. I've heard so much about you. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you really? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Well, not yet, but I will have done. When Time Lords get to
my age they tend to get their tenses muddled up. Would you liked some
biscuits too? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't have said no. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Crackers? <br>

are being enjoyed.) <br>

ROMANA: And in the same set of rooms? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Ever since I retired from Gallifrey. <br>
ROMANA: Didn't anybody notice? <br>
CHRONOTIS: One of the delights of the older Cambridge colleges.
Everyone is so discreet. Now Doctor, young fellow, what can I do for
you? <br>
DOCTOR: What can you do for me? You mean what can I do for you? You
sent for me. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Sent for you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we got your signal. <br>

DOCTOR: Romana, didn't we get a signal from the Professor, would we
come as soon as possible? <br>

inhuman voices. Didn't you, Romana? <br>

CHRONOTIS: Oh, undergraduates talking to each other, I expect. I've
trying to have it banned. <br>

DOCTOR: Professor, you said you brought it back by accident. <br>
CHRONOTIS: An oversight. I overlooked the fact that I had decided to
bring it. Just for study, you know. And as I'm now getting very old <br>

for you. <br>

risky bringing books back from Gallifrey. <br>

Rassilon, five great principles were laid down. Can you remember what
they were, my children? <br>

CHRONOTIS: Yes. Red book, about five by seven. <br>
DOCTOR: Professor, how did that book get out of the Panopticon

CHRONOTIS: Well, what I did you see was I, I just took it. <br>
DOCTOR: Took it? <br>
CHRONOTIS: Yes. There's no one interested in ancient history on
Gallifrey any longer, and I thought that certain things would be safer

discovered the way to the control room. As they entered, the ship
returned the oxygen level to normal. K9 informed me that the Tardis had
gone. In fact, the Tardis was now on board a massive Command Ship.
Skagra revealed little to Romana except that he needed Time Lord
technology to discover what the Time Lords had hidden. She was
introduced to the Krargs, creatures made of crystallised coal. Skagra
took her to an annex in the ship which contained coffin-shaped vats of
heavy gas. The Krarg Commander required new personnel and pushed a
button near the vats. Crystals quickly formed around a basic skeleton.
Rapidly, a Krarg was formed, then it pulled itself out of the vat.
Romana was appalled. Meanwhile, on the invisible spaceship, I decided
to order the ship back to its last destination. The ship complied, but
as the launch procedures commenced, unknown to me a Krarg started to
form in a generation room nearby. <br>
(Skagra's ship becomes visible once it is airborne and zooms off into
space.) <br>
TOM: I was delighted, until I discovered the journey would take nearly
three months. I ordered the ship to stop. <br>
(Which it did.) <br>
TOM: I introduced the ship to new concepts including the conceptual
geometer from analogue to digital mode, and triggering feedback
responses up to readings of seventy five dash eight three nine. As the
Krarg generation was completed, my voice was heard over the ship's
intercom ordering the activation of all re-aligned drive circuits,
which would enable the ship to travel anywhere in a couple of minutes.
A familiar sound was heard as the ship dematerialised.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: Taking Romana and the Krargs with him, Skagra
searched the records of Shada to discover the whereabouts of Salyavin.
Success! They set off for in pursuit of Cabinet 9, Chamber T, leaving
Krarg guards at the Records centre.

DOCTOR: Good! Good! Now, you two <br>
CLARE + PARSONS: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: Stay here. <br>
CLARE: Oh but <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. I am not at liberty to explain. K9, you can come along,
but no tangling with any Krargs, unless of course if you have to tangle
with any Krargs. <br>
CHRONOTIS: Hurry! Skagra will be here already. Come on. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, K9.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: The Professor seemed in some way able to know
what was Skagra was thinking, and insisted they head in a particular
direction. Skagra meanwhile revitalised the prisoner's cabinets. They
began to stir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PARSONS: Oh, it's odd the way some days work out,
isn't it? <br>
CLARE: Chris. <br>
PARSONS: I mean, there I was, just cycling down King's Parade <br>
CLARE: Chris, there's something very strange about the Professor. <br>
PARSONS: Why single out the Professor? <br>
CLARE: Well, because when I was <br>
PARSON: I want to know what's going on out there. <br>
CLARE: Chris, you're not listening to me. <br>
PARSONS: I just don't like getting left behind. I mean, just because we
come from Earth, it doesn't give everybody the right to be patronising
towards us. Well, admittedly, all this does make us look a bit
primitive. I mean, I haven't got the faintest idea how it all works. <br>
CLARE: I have. <br>
PARSONS: You do? <br>
CLARE: Yes. At least I did a while ago. <br>
PARSONS: What do you mean? <br>
CLARE: Well, that's what I been trying to tell you all along. Its
something that the Professor did to me, to my mind.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: The prisoners were reviving from their sleep.
Skagra approached Cabinet Nine and activated the revival as I and my
group burst into the chamber. Skagra warned us to keep back. He reached
into the cabinet and pulled out a pathetic dummy-like substitute.
Skagra's anger mounted and then Professor Chronotis explained that in
fact he was Salyavin.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PARSONS: Let me just get this right. You say that
he just, well, just walked into your mind? <br>
CLARE: Well, sort of. It's as if he just barged in through the front
door and started shuffling all my thoughts about. <br>
PARSONS: But the Doctor said that that ability was unique to, well, to
the guy that Skagra's come here to find. On your feet, Keightley. Come
on, let's see what's happening. Shush.
(Parsons and Clare go out into Shada.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TOM: Skagra ordered the sphere to drain Salayvin's
mind but K9 blasted it into pieces. Each fragment reformed into another
smaller sphere, one of which settled on the old man. Skagra was
exuberant. You shall see the beginning of the universal mind, he cried,
as the spheres came together discharging vast amounts of energy. And
then each of them attach themselves to one of the prisoners who turned
towards me. Chris and Clare entered the chamber and the young man
rushed forward to try to help. A sphere absorbed Chris' mind in an
instant. The prisoners, including Chris, advanced menacing towards me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <u><i><b>Part Six</b></i></u>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: K9 was quick to the rescue. He fired at one of
the prisoners who collapsed. One of the Krargs lumbered over to K9,
picked him up and hurled him through the door. Seizing my chance, I
made a run for it with Romana and Clare in tow, and with K9 burst
through the nearest door.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Quick, come in, come in. Come on, K9. Sit
down! <br>
(Romana and Clare sit quietly while the Doctor thinks for a few
moments.) <br>
DOCTOR: Got it! <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Professor's bedroom, through the door that
was originally hidden by the Doctor's Tardis.) <br>
CLARE: Well, what are we going to do? <br>
ROMANA: So far he's beaten us on every point. <br>
CLARE: Yes, he's even got Chris. <br>
ROMANA: Mmm. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Quiet, I'm thinking. <br>
(The Doctor comes back in from the kitchen.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm thinking, and it depresses me. Skagra's little zombie gang
have got the brain power of the greatest intellects of the Universe
shared out among them. The Think Tank. <br>
CLARE: The who? <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Just believe me. All the minds that
Skagra's stolen are now in the melting pot along with his own, and
operating as one. And with the Professor's, I mean with Salyavin's mind
in there too, they can now control anyone. They can control everyone.
They'll be invincible. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
ROMANA: May I just remind you of something? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: All the minds that Skagra's stolen are in the melting pot. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: That means yours is in there too. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! Romana? <br>
ROMANA: Yes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Romana, I want you to do something for me. Stand there. Romana,
I want you to wear this. <br>
(The Doctor pins a medal on Romana's blouse then kisses her on both
cheeks. They salute each other.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, now I can think.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: Skagra and his entourage of prisoners returned
to the Tardis, where he announced his intention to return to the
carrier ship. From there each of them would be taken by small craft to
various populations centres. The great mind revolution was about to
begin.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: It'll be tricky. <br>
ROMANA: And dangerous. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a touch. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, it'll be terribly, terribly dangerous for you. You'll
stand about as much chance as <br>
DOCTOR: As what? <br>
ROMANA: As a. There isn't anything that stands as little chance as you
will out there. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Well, I'll just have to be. I'll just have to be very
brave, won't I. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, it isn't funny. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, I can do your part if you can do mine. <br>
ROMANA: I'll try. <br>
DOCTOR: You're a hero. Remember? Clare? <br>
CLARE: Yes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on very tight. <br>
TOM: Skagra realised that something was wrong. <br>
(The Doctor and Romana operate Chronotis's Tardis controls
simultaneously.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ready? <br>
ROMANA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Clare? <br>
CLARE: Ready, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold tight. Now!&nbsp;<br>
TOM: I was travelling through the space-time vortex in the College room
Tardis, which was generating a forcefield. <br>
(The forcefield reaches out to include a Police Box.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ha ha! Got them. Well done, Romana. <br>
ROMANA: We haven't got to the hard bit yet. <br>
DOCTOR: No, we haven't got long. Clare? <br>
CLARE: Yes, Doctor, I'm holding on. <br>
DOCTOR: Come over here and hold onto this, then. <br>
(Clare takes hold of the very long lever.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, whatever you do, don't let go, because we are in for a
very rough ride. <br>
(A short time later.) <br>
DOCTOR: And twenty thirdly, out there in the space-time vortex, time
and distance have no meaning, but here in this little, little room <br>
ROMANA: Oh, get on with it, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Romana? <br>
ROMANA: Yes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I want you to switch off the vortex shields in this small area
here. <br>
(He indicates somewhere near the kitchen with the toasting fork.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, you can do it. I showed you how to do it. Just one
little bit of timelessness and spacelessness over there behind the tea
trolley. <br>
(Romana makes careful adjustments. The area wibbles and the tea trolley
rolls across the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: I said behind the tea trolley, not in the middle of it. <br>
ROMANA: I'm sorry, but it's very difficult. <br>
DOCTOR: Focus it! Now just one steady line, eh? One. Steady. Hold it.
Hold it! <br>
(The occasional table goes for a walk across the floor.) <br>
ROMANA: I'm trying, Doctor. I'm trying! <br>
DOCTOR: Phew. Right. Now this is a little trick I learnt from a
space-time mystic in the Quantocks. He made it seem very, very easy. <br>
(The Doctor walks forward and vanishes.) <br>
CLARE: Oh! He did it! <br>
ROMANA: Hold that switch down! <br>
ROMANA: It won't hold much longer. It's fading even faster than the
Doctor said it would. K9. K9, wake up and come here. <br>
(Clare and Romana swap levers so that Romana can open the cupboard
underneath the console.) <br>
ROMANA: Check out the subneutron circuits. <br>
K9: Detect circuit malfunction, mistress. <br>
TOM: With increasing difficulty, I was able to reach the Tardis in the
time tunnel. I just managed to get part of my arm through it. <br>
K9: Impossible to effect repair in time available, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: Well, hold it, K9. Stop it deteriorating. <br>
K9: Impossible to stop it, mistress. I can only slow down circuit
deterioration. <br>
ROMANA: The Doctor needs every second we can give him. <br>
CLARE: This switch is getting very hot. <br>
ROMANA: You must hold it down. <br>
CLARE: But I can't. It's getting hotter. <br>
TOM: I seemed unable to get any further. In fact, I started to slide
backwards.&nbsp;<br>
CLARE: It's burning me. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, hold it down with a pencil. <br>
CLARE: But I haven't got one. <br>
(Romana tries to reach one on a pile of papers whilst hanging on to the
long lever.) <br>
ROMANA: I can't reach it. <br>
CLARE: Oh. Well, here, hold this. <br>
(Clare releases her switch and the console goes bang! The girls are
thrown across the room.) <br>
TOM: And I vanished as the Room and the Tardis spun wildly away from
each other. <br>
(Romana bandages Clare's burnt hand.) <br>
CLARE: What about the Doctor? <br>
ROMANA: I don't know. It was a very dangerous idea trying to make that
crossing, and he didn't get as much time as he wanted. I just don't
know. <br>
CLARE: What should we do? <br>
ROMANA: Well, we'll just go ahead as planned. There. How's that? <br>
CLARE: Oh, that's fine, thank you. It wasn't a bad burn. Do you think
the Doctor will be all right? <br>
ROMANA: We'll just go ahead as planned.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: Then I regained consciousness in a small
equipment room in the Tardis. I rummaged through the equipment. In the
carrier ship, the Tardis arrived. Skagra planned an infinite concert of
the mind as he surveyed the stars from the command deck, unaware of my
presence on board. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Prof. Chronotis' rooms]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">K9: Repairs completed, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: Let me see. Good boy, K9. Now we can go. Though I dread to
think what we're walking into if. Oh, well, let's just do it.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: I managed to lash up a helmet-like affair made
with bits of electronic equipment and a chunk of a table top. The
Professor's Tardis, now in its usual form of a door, materialised on
the command deck. An unpleasant welcome committee was prepared for me,
but it was K9 that emerged from the door. I'd been watching all this on
my own Tardis screen and emerged wearing the strange helmet. All the
prisoners turned to face me as Skagra threatened my life. I pressed a
button on my helmet and looked hard at Skagra, as did all the prisoners
in unison. With intense mental effort, Skagra tried to control the
prisoners, but I told him he'd forgotten something. That the deranged
billiard ball had been used once too often, and that my brain was in
there as well. Skagra strained for control. The prisoners nearest him
turned to face me, the ones in the middle of the hall were confused,
and the ones near to me were firmly fixed looking at Skagra. A mighty
battle of wills took place with me gaining the upper hand. Momentarily
distracted by a Krarg, I lost control and a prisoner swung towards me.
Fire, K9, I called, and the metallic computer held the Krarg in a beam
near the door to the generation annex. The prisoners split into two
groups as I regained some lost ground. The two groups wrestled with
each other, obeying mental instructions from their two leaders. I
manoeuvred Skagra nearer to the dangerously overheated
Krarg. The evil genius ordered the Krarg to back off. It did, and fell
backwards into its generation vat where it dissolved. K9 was firing
relentlessly at the reinforcements of Krargs who arrived. Skagra
thought victory was within his grasp as Romana emerged cautiously from
the door and into the generation annex, where she tipped over the vats
of heavy gas which poured into the main Command Deck. She examined the
wires of the main vat, pulled them out of their sockets and trailing
the wires marched forward to Clare. The girls made for opposite sides
of the room which was now swimming in the green gas. Skagra had turned
the tables on me. I was being forced toward burning Krargs. Romana and
Clare plunged their wires into the gas. The Krargs started to dissolve.
As Skagra stood appalled, I took mind control, and the prisoners, in a
solid phalanx, turned on Skagra and he ran for his ship. On board, he
ordered it to take off instantly but a block of light engulfed him and
he vanished and was deposited in the ship's brig.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Skagra is in the small square room that he had
previously imprisoned the Doctor, Parsons and K9 in. Somehow, Skagra
seems smaller here.) <br>
SKAGRA: Ship! Let me out of here. I am your Lord Skagra. Let me out! <br>
(The female ship's voice is heard for the first time.) <br>
SHIP: I am very much afraid I can no longer accept your orders. You are
an enemy of my Lord the Doctor. <br>
SKAGRA: I am your lord! I built you! Release me, I command you. And
launch instantly!
SHIP: Do you know the Doctor well? He is a wonderful, wonderful man. He
has done the most extraordinary things to my circuitry. <br>
SKAGRA: Release me! <br>
SHIP: Truly wonderful. If you like, I will tell you all about him. <br>
(Skagra sinks to his knees in despair.) <br>
SKAGRA: Let me out! Let me out! <br>
(The Ship laughs gently.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: Romana and Clare were attending to the
prisoners, who were in shock, while I was dissecting the spheres to
restore the genii's minds to them. I intended to take them back to
Shada as I refused to play judge and jury. I informed them that Shada
was only forgotten because Salyavin made the Time Lords to forget. He
didn't want his escape to be discovered, hence he stole the book when
he left Gallifrey.

the college.) <br>
CONSTABLE: Stolen a room? <br>
WILKIN: That is the only way I can describe it. <br>
CONSTABLE: Well, you see, sir, in my experience people don't usually
steal rooms very much. They may steal from rooms, but steal the rooms
themselves? Very rarely. In fact I think, er, never is probably the
word I'm looking for here, sir. I mean, where's the advantage in it?
Not much of a black market in rooms, is there? Wouldn't get much for
it. <br>
(They go through an archway.) <br>
WILKIN: I know it's very difficult to understand. It's also very easy
to be sarcastic. <br>
CONSTABLE: Sarcastic, sir? I don't know the word. Now why don't you run
over the salient points again? <br>
WILKIN: Oh, well, I got to the door of the room and I opened it, and
beyond it there was nothing. <br>
CONSTABLE: Nothing at all, sir? <br>
WILKIN: Absolutely nothing at all. Well, nothing except for this sort
of blue haze. <br>
CONSTABLE: Ah, well, the blue haze, you see, sir may be the vital clue
we're searching for. <br>
WILKIN: And I was not drinking. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TOM: Romana wondered whether Chronotis or rather,
Salyavin was still alive on Shada, considering that the reason the

he was near the end of his lifes.
