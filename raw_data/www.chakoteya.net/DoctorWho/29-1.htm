street, listening to a rap song on her phone radio.) <br>
RADIO: What can happen on an average beautiful day? You never know.
Celebrate seasonal changes. It's hot for brothers. On a beautiful
sunshiny day. <br>

Mum is going mental. Swear to God, Martha, this is epic. You've got to
get in there and stop him. </font></p>

LEO: Martha, If Mum and Dad start to kick off, tell them I don't even
want a party. I didn't even ask for one. They can always give me the
money instead. </font></p>

(And walks away again. Martha arrives at the Royal Hope Hospital, and a
man in full motorcycle gear barges past her.) <br>
MARTHA: Oi! Watch, it mate. <br>
(The figure turns to stare at Martha, then walks on. Inside, at her
locker, Martha puts on a white coat, then gets an electric shock from
the door.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The consultant and his students are gathered
around a woman's bed. The consultant, Mister Stoker, is taking her
pulse.) <br>
FLORENCE: I was all right till this morning, and then, I don't know, I
woke up and I felt all dizzy again. It was worse than when I came in. <br>
STOKER: Pulse is slightly thready. Well, let's see what Britain's
finest might suggest. Any ideas, Morgenstern? <br>
(A nervous young man.) <br>
MORGENSTERN: Dizziness can be a sign of early onset diabetes. <br>
STOKER: Hardly early onset, if you'll forgive me, Miss Finnegan. Any
more ideas? Swales?<br>
(A young woman.) <br>
SWALES: Er, could recommend a CT scan. <br>
STOKER: And spend all our money? Jones? <br>
MARTHA: We could take bloods and check for Meniere's disease. <br>
STOKER: Or we could simply ask the patient. What did you have for
dinner last night? <br>
FLORENCE: I had salad. <br>
STOKER: And the night before? <br>
FLORENCE: Salad again. <br>
STOKER: And salad every night for the past week, contrary to my
instructions. Salt deficiency, that's all. Simple, honest salt. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Hospital corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">STOKER: Hippocrates himself expounded on the
virtues of salt. Recommended the inhalation of steam from sea water.
Though no doubt if he'd been afflicted with my students, results might
have been rather more colourful. <br>
(Stoker leads his students from the Breast Screening Unit to the
Orthopedic Dept, past the lifts. Two figures in full motorcycle
leathers get out. In reality, they would never have been allowed in the
hospital without taking off their helmets.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Stoker pushes back the curtain around a bed.) <br>
STOKER: Now then, Mister Smith, a very good morning to you. How are you
today? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, not so bad. Still a bit, you know, blah. <br>
STOKER: John Smith, admitted yesterday with severe abdominal pains.
Jones, why don't you see what you can find? Amaze me. <br>
MARTHA: That wasn't very clever, running around outside, was it? <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry? <br>
MARTHA: On Chancellor Street this morning? You came up to me and took
your tie off. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? What did I do that for? <br>
MARTHA: I don't know, you just did. <br>
DOCTOR: Not me. I was here, in bed. Ask the nurses. <br>
MARTHA: Well, that's weird, cause it looked like you. Have you got a
brother? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not any more. Just me. <br>
STOKER: As time passes and I grow ever more infirm and weary, Miss
Jones. <br>
MARTHA: Sorry. Right. <br>
(Martha listens to the Doctor's chest, and hears the two heartbeats.
The Doctor winks at her.) <br>
STOKER: I weep for future generations. Are you having trouble locating
the heart, Miss Jones? <br>
MARTHA: Er, I don't know. Stomach cramps? <br>
STOKER: That is a symptom, not a diagnosis. And you rather failed basic
techniques by not consulting first with the patient's chart. <br>
(Stoker gets an electric shock from the metal clip.) <br>
MARTHA: That happened to me this morning. <br>
MORGENSTERN: I had the same thing on the door handle. <br>
SWALES: And me, on the lift. <br>
STOKER: That's only to be expected. There's a thunderstorm moving in
and lightning is a form of static electricity, as was first proven by.
Anyone? <br>
DOCTOR: Benjamin Franklin. <br>
STOKER: Correct. <br>
DOCTOR: My mate, Ben. That was a day and a half. I got rope burns off
that kite, and then I got soaked.. <br>
STOKER: Quite. <br>
DOCTOR: And then I got electrocuted. <br>
STOKER: Moving on. I think perhaps a visit from psychiatric. And next
we have <br>

MARTHA: No, listen, I've worked out a plan. We tell Annelise that the

up. <br>
TISH [OC]: I wish you'd take this seriously. </font></p>

(She sees the Doctor walk past wearing a dressing gown.) <br>
MARTHA: We tell Dad and Annalise to get there early, about seven
thirty, and we tell Leo get there at the same time so we can do all
that birthday stuff. We tell Mum to get there for about eight thirty,
nine, and that gives me time to have a word with Annalise, and <br>

and the building tilts from side to side a lot. Finally it stops.) <br>
MARTHA: What the hell was that? <br>
SWALES: Are you all right? <br>
MARTHA: I think so, yeah. It felt like an earthquake, or <br>
SWALES: Martha? It's night. Look. It was lunchtime. <br>

SWALES: We can't be. <br>

(Martha reaches to open the window.) <br>
SWALES: Don't! We'll lose all the air. <br>
MARTHA: But they're not exactly air tight. If the air was going to get
sucked out it would have happened straight away, but it didn't. So how

(The Doctor has got dressed behind his curtain.) <br>
DOCTOR: Very good point. Brilliant, in fact. What was your name? <br>
MARTHA: Martha. <br>
DOCTOR: And it was Jones, wasn't it? Well then, Martha Jones, the
question is, how are we still breathing? <br>
SWALES: We can't be. <br>
DOCTOR: Obviously we are, so don't waste my time. Martha, what have we
got? Is there a balcony on this floor, or a veranda, or <br>

DOCTOR: You okay? <br>

DOCTOR: Sure? <br>
MARTHA: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Want to go back in? <br>
MARTHA: No way. I mean, we could die any minute, but all the same, it's
beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you think? <br>
MARTHA: How many people want to go to the moon? And here we are. <br>
DOCTOR: Standing in the Earthlight. <br>
MARTHA: What do you think happened? <br>
DOCTOR: What do you think? <br>
MARTHA: Extraterrestrial. It's got to be. I don't know, a few years ago
that would have sounded mad, but these days? That spaceship flying into
Big Ben, Christmas, those Cybermen things. I had a cousin. Adeola. She
worked at Canary Wharf. She never came home. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: I was there, in the battle. <br>
MARTHA: I promise you, Mister Smith, we will find a way out. If we can
travel to the moon, then we can travel back. There's got to be a way. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not Smith. That's not my real name. <br>
MARTHA: Who are you, then? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. <br>
MARTHA: Me too, if I can pass my exams. What is it then, Doctor Smith? <br>
DOCTOR: Just the Doctor. <br>
MARTHA: How do you mean, just the Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Just the Doctor. <br>
MARTHA: What, people call you the Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
MARTHA: Well, I'm not. As far as I'm concerned, you've got to earn that
title. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'd better make a start, then. Let's have a look. There
must be some sort of <br>
(He throws something out, and it bounces off -)<br>
DOCTOR: Forcefield keeping the air in. <br>
MARTHA: But if that's like a bubble sealing us in, that means this is
the only air we've got. What happens when it runs out? <br>
DOCTOR: How many people in this hospital? <br>
MARTHA: I don't know. A thousand? <br>
DOCTOR: One thousand people Suffocating. <br>
MARTHA: Why would anyone do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Head's up! Ask them yourself. <br>

Columns of marching beings come stomping out.) <br>

STOKER: I think we've gone beyond aspirin, Miss er <br>
FLORENCE: Finnegan. <br>
STOKER: Names. What are names now when something unnamable is marching
towards us across the moon? Two more years, I thought. Two more years
and then retire to Florida. But there is Florida, in the sky. I can see
it. My daughter, she's still in university. I am never going to see her
again. <br>

FLORENCE: These are my lovely boys. I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

STOKER: I'm sorry? <br>
FLORENCE: You see, there are great tests to come, and terrible deeds.
Some of them my own. But if I am to survive this, I need you. <br>

STOKER: What are you doing? What are you doing? Well, let go of me!

DOCTOR: They're like police. Well, police for hire. They're more like
interplanetary thugs. <br>
MARTHA: And they brought us to the moon? <br>
DOCTOR: Neutral territory. According to galactic law, they've got no
jurisdiction over the Earth, and they isolated it. That rain,
lightning? That was them, using an H2O scoop. <br>
MARTHA: What are you on about, galactic law? Where'd you get that from?
If they're police, are we under arrest? Are we trespassing on the moon
or something? <br>
DOCTOR: No, but I like that. Good thinking. No, I wish it were that
simple. They're making a catalogue. That means they're after something

DOCTOR: I did, but it was stolen by Emily Pankhurst, cheeky woman. Oh,
this computer! The Judoon must have locked it down. Judoon platoon upon
the moon. Because I was just travelling past. I swear, I was just
wandering. I wasn't looking for trouble, honestly, I wasn't, but I
noticed these plasma coils around the hospital, and that lightning,
that's a plasma coil. Been building up for two days now, so I checked
in. I thought something was going on inside. It turns out the plasma
coils were the Judoon up above. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh yes. If I can find this thing first. Oh! You see, they're
thick! Judoon are thick! They are completely thick! They wiped the
records. Oh, that's clever. <br>
MARTHA: What are we looking for? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Say, any patient admitted in the past week with
unusual symptoms. Maybe there's a back-up. <br>
MARTHA: Just keep working. I'll go ask Mister Stoker. He might know.

the door off its hinges. It gets in and the Doctor points the x-ray

(The leather-clad man gets a massive dose of radiation, and falls face
down. Martha turns the machine off.) <br>
MARTHA: What did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: Increased the radiation by five thousand per cent. Killed him
dead. <br>
MARTHA: But isn't that going to kill you? <br>
DOCTOR: Nah, it's only roentgen radiation. We used to play with
roentgen bricks in the nursery. It's safe for you to come out. I've
absorbed it all. All I need to do is expel it. If I concentrate I can
shake the radiation out of my body and into one spot. It's in my left
shoe. Here we go, here we go. Easy does it. Out, out, out, out, out.
Out, out. Ah, ah, ah, ah! It is, it is, it is, it is, it is hot. Hold

MARTHA: You're completely mad. <br>
DOCTOR: You're right. I look daft with one shoe. <br>
(So he gets rid of the other one.) <br>
DOCTOR: Barefoot on the moon. <br>
MARTHA: So what is that thing? And where's it from, the planet Zovirax?
<br>
DOCTOR: It's just a Slab. They're called Slabs. Basic slave drones.
See? Solid leather, all the way through. Someone has got one hell of a
fetish. <br>
MARTHA: But it was that woman, Miss Finnegan. It was working for her,
just like a servant. <br>
(The Doctor had left his screwdriver in the x-ray machine. It is
totally fried.) <br>
DOCTOR: My sonic screwdriver. <br>
MARTHA: She was one of the patients, but <br>

MARTHA: She had a straw like some kind of vampire. <br>

MARTHA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. <br>
(He throws the screwdriver away.) <br>
DOCTOR: You called me Doctor. <br>
MARTHA: Anyway? Miss Finnegan is the alien. She was drinking Mister
Stoker's blood. <br>
DOCTOR: Funny time to take a snack. You'd think she'd be hiding.
Unless. No. Yes, that's it. Wait a minute. Yes! Shape-changer. Internal

all the same. <br>
FLORENCE: The magnetic setting now increased to fifty thousand Tesla. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, that's a bit strong, isn't it? <br>
FLORENCE: It'll send out a magnetic pulse that'll fry the brain stems
of every living thing within two hundred and fifty thousand miles.
