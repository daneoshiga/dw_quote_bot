a lovely view of the Horse Head Nebula.) <br>
TANNOY: Would all passengers please return to their seats and fasten
their safety belts? We are experiencing slight turbulence. <br>
(Things are going Bang! on the bridge, which is strongly modelled on
the Starship Enterprise.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Both engines failed, and the storm-gate's critical. The ship
is going down. Christmas is cancelled. <br>
PILOT: Entering atmosphere now. Level. Keep her level. <br>
CO-PILOT: Level with what? I can't see. What is that stuff? <br>
CAPTAIN: Clouds? <br>
PILOT: What kind of clouds? <br>
(Distress signal activated.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Are you sending a distress signal? <br>
PILOT: It's not me. <br>
(Location: Honeymoon suite.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Who's in the honeymoon suite? <br>
(Amy enters, wearing her stripper policewoman outfit.) <br>
AMY: I've sent for help. <br>
CAPTAIN: Who the hell are you? <br>
AMY: Look, there's a friend of mine, okay? And he can help us. He'll
come. <br>
CAPTAIN: And what are you wearing? <br>
AMY: That doesn't matter. <br>
CAPTAIN: Are you from the honeymoon suite? <br>
AMY: Oh, shut up. <br>
(Enter a Roman Centurion.) <br>
RORY: Amy, the light's stopped flashing Does that mean he's coming? <br>
PILOT: Honeymoon suite? <br>
RORY: Oh. Oh, the clothes. Er. It is just a bit of fun. <br>
AMY: Really, shut up. <br>
CO-PILOT: Sensor loss on eighty percent of the hull. <br>
RORY: So, does this mean he's coming, or does it mean I need to change
the bulb? <br>
AMY: He'll come. He always comes. <br>
RORY: Right. Well, he is cutting it kind of fine. <br>
CAPTAIN: If we can't stabilise the orbit, we're finished. <br>
CO-PILOT: There's nothing to lock onto. I am flying blind. <br>
AMY: Come on, Doctor, come on. <br>
CO-PILOT: There's something coming alongside us. Something small, like
a shuttle. <br>
AMY: Just this once, don't be late. <br>
PILOT: Ma'am. Incoming message. It's from the other ship. <br>
CAPTAIN: On screen. <br>
(Message reads - Come along Pond.) <br>
CAPTAIN: What does that mean? <br>
AMY: It's Christmas.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Down below the thick cloud layer is a bustling
metropolis, dominated by a domed building sending an energy beam into
the sky. A scruffy boy runs through a market area, slightly alien
Dickensian.) <br>
SARDICK: [OC]: On every world, wherever people are, in the deepest part
of the winter, at the exact mid-point, everybody stops and turns and
hugs, as if to say, well done. Well done, everyone. We're halfway out
of the dark. Back on Earth, we called this Christmas, or the Winter
Solstice. On this world, the first settlers called it the Crystal
Feast. <br>
SARDICK: You know what I call it? I call it expecting something for
nothing. <br>
(Hello, Ebenezer Scrooge. He turns from the little window and walks
into a massive room with just a pieces of furniture around a large but
empty fireplace. A poor family are waiting for him, a man, an old woman
and a young boy.) <br>
BENJAMIN: Sir. Mister Sardick. We're only asking for one day. Just let
her out for Christmas. She loves Christmas. <br>
(A cryochamber is wheeled in, containing a young woman.) <br>
SARDICK: Does she? Oh, does she? I see. Hello. Wakey, wakey. It's
Christmas. Do you know what? I think she's a bit cool about the whole
thing. Ha, ha! That was funny. <br>
(The servants chuckle obediently.) <br>
BOY: She's frozen. <br>
SARDICK: She's what, sorry? <br>
BOY: She's in the ice. She can't hear you. <br>
SARDICK: Oh, what a clever little boy. You must be so irritated. How
much? <br>
(A servant brings an account.) <br>
SERVANT: Er, it's four thousand five hundred Gideons, sir. <br>
SARDICK: You took a loan of four thousand five hundred Gideons, and
Little Miss Christmas is my security. <br>
(How very Monty Python Merchant Banker. Another servant brings in a
ringing candlestick telephone.) <br>
BENJAMIN: We're not asking for her back. Just let her have one day. Let
her have Christmas with us. <br>
SERVANT: Sir, it's the President. <br>
SARDICK: Tell him I'm busy. Now, where were we? Oh, yes. She's pretty,
though, your daughter. Maybe I should keep her. <br>
BENJAMIN: She's not my daughter, sir. <br>
ISABELLA: She's my sister. She volunteered for the ice when the family
were in difficulties many years ago. <br>
SERVANT: Sorry, sir. The President says there's a galaxy class ship
trapped in the cloud layer and, well, we have to let it land. <br>
SARDICK: Or? <br>
SERVANT: Well, or it'll crash, sir. <br>
SARDICK: Oh. Well, it's a kind of landing, isn't it? <br>
SERVANT: It's from Earth, sir, registering over four thousand lifeforms
on board. <br>
SARDICK: Not if we wait a bit. <br>
SERVANT: You can't just let it crash, sir. <br>
(The sound of the Tardis arriving nearby.)&nbsp;<br>
SARDICK: Says who? Oh, give it here. <br>
(Sardick takes the telephone.) <br>
SARDICK: Look, petal, we already have a surplus population. No more
people allowed on this planet. I don't make the rules. <br>
(Soot falls down the chimney.) <br>
SARDICK: Oh no, hang on, I do. <br>
(Sardick hangs up the receiver.) <br>
SARDICK: Right, you lot. Poor, begging people. Off home and pray for a
miracle. <br>
(The Doctor tumbles out of the fireplace in a shower of soot.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Yes. Blimey. Sorry. Christmas Eve on a rooftop. Saw a
chimney, my whole brain just went, what the hell. <br>
(He goes to the family.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, fat fellow will be doing the rounds later. I'm
just scoping out the general chimney-ness. Yes. Nice size, good
traction. Big tick. <br>
BENJAMIN: Fat fellow? <br>
DOCTOR: Father Christmas, Santa Claus or, as I've always known him,
Jeff. <br>
BOY: There's no such person as Father Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah? <br>
(The Doctor produces an old photograph.) <br>
DOCTOR: Me and Father Christmas, Frank Sinatra's hunting lodge, 1952.
See him at the back with the blonde? Albert Einstein. The three of us
together. Brrm. Watch out. Okay? Keep the faith. Stay off the naughty
list. <br>
(The Doctor spots what looks like a big cinema organ.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo. Now, what's this then? I love this. A big flashy lighty
thing. That's what brought me here. Big flashy lighty things have got
me written all over them. Not actually, but give me time, and a crayon.
Now, this big flashy lighty thing is connected to the spire in your
dome, yeah? And it controls the sky. Well, technically it controls the
clouds, which technically aren't clouds at all. Well, they're clouds of
tiny particles of ice. Ice clouds. Love that. Who's she? <br>
SARDICK: Nobody important. <br>
DOCTOR: Nobody important. Blimey, that's amazing. Do you know, in nine
hundred years of time and space, I've never met anyone who wasn't
important before. Now, this console is the key to saving that ship, or
I'll eat my hat. If I had a hat. I'll eat someone's hat. Not someone
who's using their hat. I don't want to shock a nun, or something.
Sorry, rambling, because, because this isn't working! <br>
SARDICK: The controls are isomorphic. One to one. They respond only to
me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you fibber. Isomorphic. There's no such thing. <br>
(Sardick reaches over and switches it off then on again. All the Doctor
gets are annoyed beeps, even with the screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: These controls are isomorphic. <br>
SARDICK: The skies of this entire world are mine. My family tamed them,
and now I own them. <br>
DOCTOR: Tamed the sky? What does that mean? <br>
SARDICK: It means I'm Kazran Sardick. How can you possibly not know who
I am? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, just easily bored, I suppose. So, I need your help, then.
<br>
SARDICK: Make an appointment. <br>
DOCTOR: There are four thousand and three people in a spaceship trapped
in your cloud belt. Without your help, they're going to die. <br>
SARDICK: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't have to let that happen. <br>
SARDICK: I know, but I'm going to. Bye, bye. Bored now. Chuck. <br>
(The Doctor wriggles out of the clutches of a servant and goes to
Sardick, who is settling into a tall leather armchair by the
fireplace.) <br>
SARDICK: Ooo, look at you, looking all tough now. <br>
DOCTOR: There are four thousand and three people I won't allow to die
tonight. Do you know where that puts you? <br>
SARDICK: Where? <br>
DOCTOR: Four thousand and four. <br>
SARDICK: Was that a sort of threat-y thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Whatever happens tonight, remember you brought it on yourself. <br>
SARDICK: Yeah, yeah, right. Get him out of here. And next time, try and
find me some funny poor people. <br>
(The boy throws a stray piece of coal at Sardick as he, his family and
the Doctor are hustled out. Sardick runs over to hit the child.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, stop, don't. <br>
BENJAMIN: Don't you dare. You leave him. <br>
SARDICK: Get him out of here. Get that foul-smelling family out of
here. Out! <br>
BOY: We're going! <br>
(The Doctor remains behind.) <br>
SARDICK: What? What do you want? <br>
DOCTOR: A simple life. But you didn't hit the boy. <br>
SARDICK: Well, I will next time. <br>
DOCTOR: You see, you won't. Now why? What am I missing? <br>
SARDICK: Get out. Get out of this house. <br>
DOCTOR: The chairs. Of course, the chairs. Stupid me, the chairs. <br>
SARDICK: The chairs? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a portrait on the wall behind me. Looks like you, but
it's too old, so it's your father. All the chairs are angled away from
it. Daddy's been dead for twenty years, but you still can't get
comfortable where he can see you. There's a Christmas tree in the
painting, but none in this house, on Christmas Eve. You're scared of
him, and you're scared of being like him, and good for you, you're not
like him, not really. Do you know why? <br>
SARDICK: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you didn't hit the boy. Merry Christmas, Mister
Sardick. <br>
SARDICK: I despise Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: You shouldn't. It's very you. <br>
SARDICK: It's what? What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Halfway out of the dark. <br>
(The servants return and the Doctor leaves.) <br>
SARDICK: Get her downstairs with the others. And clean up this mess.

BENJAMIN: You'd better get inside, sir. The fog's thick tonight, and
there's a fish warning. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, yeah. Sorry, fish? <br>
BENJAMIN: Yeah. You know what they're like when they get a bit hungry. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, fish, I know fish. Fish? <br>

few fish through the cloud layer when he's in a bad mood. Thank you.

KAZRAN [on screen]: Everyone at school's seen the fish. <br>

gypsies. <br>

singing. <br>

DOCTOR: Found it on an old drive. Sorry about the picture quality. Had
to recover the data using quantum enfolding and a paperclip. Oh, I
wouldn't bother calling your servants. They quit. Apparently they won
the lottery at exactly the same time, which is a bit lucky when you
think about it. <br>

the wrong direction. Pay attention. <br>
KAZRAN [on screen]: But Mrs Mantovani's always my babysitter. <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: Times change. Wouldn't you say? You see? Christmas
Past. <br>
KAZRAN [on screen]: Who are you talking to? <br>
DOCTOR [on screen]: You. Now, your past is going to change. That means
your memories will too. Bit scary, but you'll get the hang of it. <br>

You're twelve years old, so we'll stay away from under the bed.
Cupboard! Big cupboard. I love a cupboard. Do you know, there's a thing
called a face spider. It's just like a tiny baby's head with spider
legs, and it's specifically evolved to scuttle up the backs of bedroom
cupboards which, yeah, I probably shouldn't have mentioned. Right. So.
What are we going to do? Eat crisps and talk about girls? I've never
actually done that, but I bet it's easy. Girls? Yeah? <br>
KAZRAN: Are you really a babysitter? <br>
DOCTOR: I think you'll find I'm universally recognised as a mature and
responsible adult. <br>
(He shows Kazran the psychic paper.) <br>
KAZRAN: It's just a lot of wavy lines. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's shorted out. Finally, a lie too big. Okay, no, not
really a babysitter, but it's Christmas Eve. You don't want a real one.
You want me. <br>
KAZRAN: Why? What's so special about you? <br>
DOCTOR: Have you ever seen Mary Poppins? <br>
KAZRAN: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Because that comparison would've been rubbish. Fish in
the fog. Fish in the clouds. How do people ever get bored? How did
boredom even get invented? <br>
KAZRAN: My dad's invented a machine to control the cloud belt. Tame the
sky, he says. The fish'll be able to come down, but only when we let
them. We can charge whatever we like. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. I've seen your dad's machine. <br>
(A shark glides past behind the Doctor's back. The window is still
open.) <br>
KAZRAN: What? You can't have. <br>
DOCTOR: Tame the sky. Human beings. You always manage to find the
boring alternative, don't you? You want to see one? A fish. We can do
that. We can see a fish. <br>
KAZRAN: Aren't you going to tell me it's dangerous? <br>
DOCTOR: Dangerous? Come on, we're boys. And you know what boys say in
the face of danger. <br>
KAZRAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Mummy. <br>

KAZRAN: Are there any face spiders in here? <br>
DOCTOR: Nah, not at this time of night. They'll all be sleeping in your
mattress.
So, why are you so interested in fish? <br>
KAZRAN: Because they're scary. <br>

KAZRAN: What kind of tie is that? <br>
DOCTOR: A cool one. <br>

DOCTOR: Why are you really interested in fish? <br>
KAZRAN: My school. During the last fog belt, the nets broke and there
was an attack. Loads of them. A whole shoal. No one was hurt, but it
was the most fish ever seen below the mountains. <br>
DOCTOR: Were you scared? <br>
KAZRAN: I wasn't there. I was off sick. <br>

DOCTOR: Yeah, I think you're right. <br>
KAZRAN: I've never kissed anyone before. What do I do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, try and be all nervous and rubbish and a bit shaky. <br>
KAZRAN: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you're going to be like that anyway. Might as well make
it part of the plan, then it'll feel on purpose. Off you go, then. <br>
KAZRAN: What, now? I kiss her now? <br>
DOCTOR: Kazran, trust me. It's this or go to your room and design a new
kind of screwdriver. Don't make my mistakes. Now, go. <br>
(Kazran returns to Abigail, who pulls him to her and kisses him. <br>
In the future, Sardick looks at pictures of them both in front of the
Statue of Liberty, Uluru - or Eyres Rock if you prefer - Sydney Opera
House, Empire State Building, Eiffel Tower. One says California 1952 on
the back. The three are in front of the Hollywood sign.)

ABIGAIL: I have something to tell you. <br>

ABIGAIL: A very bad thing. <br>
KAZRAN: What is it? <br>
ABIGAIL: The truth. <br>
(The Doctor appears from behind a tree as Abigail and Kazran are
kissing. His has lipstick on his face.) <br>
DOCTOR: Guys, we've really got to go quite quickly. I just accidentally
got engaged to Marilyn Monroe. How do you keep going like that? Do you
breathe out your ears? Hello? Sorry. Hello? Guys, she's phoned a
chapel. There's a car outside. This is happening now. <br>
MARILYN: Yoo-hoo! <br>
DOCTOR: Yoo-hoo. Right. Fine. Thank you. I'll just go and get married
then, shall I? See how you like that. Marilyn? Get your coat! <br>

KAZRAN: Not your fault. Times change. <br>
DOCTOR: Not as much as I'd hoped. Kazran. I'll be needing a new one,

(The Doctor gives Kazran his half a screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Merry Christmas. And if you ever need me, just activate it.
I'll hear you. <br>
KAZRAN: I won't need you. <br>

the Wurlitzer is ready.) <br>
ELLIOT: Another Christmas Eve, Kazran. But a very special one. It's
complete. Look at it. Sound waves. As simple as that. We can control
the clouds, the fog, the fish. <br>
KAZRAN: Why do we want to control the fish? <br>
ELLIOT: People are cattle. If you want to control cattle, you need to
control their predators. What's the face for? Look what I'm giving you.
The sky, and everything beneath it. Only you and I can control this.
This planet is ours. <br>
KAZRAN: Excuse me, Father. <br>
(Kazran returns to his room and takes the screwdriver from his desk
drawer. The Doctor is standing outside the window. Kazran draws the
curtains on him and puts the screwdriver back. Time passes and old
Sardick takes it out again.
Shortly after, the telephone rings. Sardick answers it.) <br>
SARDICK: Yes, what? Oh, Mister President, we've been through this. It's
not going to crash on my house, so what's it got to do with me? Yes, I
know. four thousand and three. As a very old friend of mine once took a
very long time to explain, life isn't fair. <br>

AMY: Hello. <br>

AMY: You didn't think this was over, did you? I'm the Ghost of

SARDICK: Who are they? <br>
AMY: The people on the ship up there. The ones that you're going to let
die tonight. <br>
SARDICK: Why are they singing? <br>
AMY: For their lives. Which one's Abigail? The Doctor told me. <br>
SARDICK: Did he now? <br>
AMY: AH, he doesn't hold back. You know the Doctor. <br>
SARDICK: How do I? I never met him before tonight. Now I seem to have
known him all my life. How? Why? <br>
AMY: You're the only person who can let that ship land. He was trying
to turn you into a nicer person. And he was trying to do it nicely. <br>
SARDICK: He's changed my past, my whole life. <br>
AMY: Time can be rewritten. <br>
SARDICK: You tell the Doctor. Tell him from me, people can't. <br>

AMY: That's Abigail? <br>
SARDICK: I would never have known her if the Doctor hadn't changed the

AMY: Well, that's good, isn't it? <br>
SARDICK: No. <br>
AMY: Why is she still in there? You could let her out any time. <br>
SARDICK: Oh, yes. Any time at all. Any time I choose. <br>
AMY: Then why don't you? <br>
SARDICK: This is what the Doctor did to me. Abigail was ill when she
went into the ice. On the point of death. I suppose the rest in the ice
helped her. But she's used up her time. All those Christmas Eves with
me. I could release her any time I want, and she would live a single
day. So tell me, Ghost of Christmas Present, how do I choose which day?
<br>
AMY: I'm sorry. I really am. I'm very, very sorry. But you know what?
She's got more time left than I have. More than anyone on this ship. <br>

to let a lot of people die, I thought you might like to see where it's
all going to happen. <br>
SARDICK: The singing. What is it? I don't understand. <br>
RORY: It's the Doctor's idea. The harmonies resonate in the ice
crystals, that's why thee fish like it. He thought maybe it would
stabilise the ship. But it isn't working. It's not powerful enough. <br>
SARDICK: Why are they still singing, then? <br>
CAPTAIN: Because we haven't told them. Sir, I understand you have a
machine that controls this cloud layer. If you can release us from it,
we still have time to make a landing. Nobody has to die. <br>

DOCTOR: What, half a screwdriver? With the other half up in the sky in
a big old shark, right in the heart of the cloud layer. If we use your
aerial to boost the signal, set up a resonation pattern between the two
halves. Ooo, come on, that would work. My screwdriver, coolest bit of
kit on this planet. Coolest two bits. It could do it. <br>
