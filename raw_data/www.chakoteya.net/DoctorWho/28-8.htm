DOCTOR: I don't know what's wrong though. She's sort of queasy.
Indigestion, like she didn't
want to land. <br>
ROSE: Oh, if you think there's going to be trouble, we could always get
back inside and go somewhere else. <br>

these things out of kits. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, it's a sanctuary base. <br>
COMPUTER: Close door 17. <br>
DOCTOR: Deep Space exploration. We've gone way out. And listen to that,
underneath. Someone's drilling. <br>
ROSE: Welcome to hell. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's not that bad. <br>
ROSE: No, over there. <br>
(The words are painted on the wall in big block letters, and a vertical
alien script underneath.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on, what does that say? That's weird, it won't translate. <br>
ROSE: But I thought the Tardis translated everything, writing as well.
We should see English. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. If that's not working, then it means this writing is
old. Very old. Impossibly old. We should find out who's in charge. <br>
(He starts to spin the wheel on another bulkhead door.) <br>
DOCTOR: We've gone beyond the reach of the Tardis' knowledge. Not a
good move. And if someone's lucky enough <br>
COMPUTER: Open door 19. <br>
(Aliens with tentacles where our noses and mouths are, are standing
outside the door. They all have a tube going in behind the tentacles,
and carry a white globe in their right hands which they use for
communication, just like the Gaim
in Babylon 5.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! Right. Hello. Sorry. I was just saying, er, nice base. <br>
ALL OOD: We must feed. <br>
DOCTOR: You've got to what? <br>
ALL OOD: We must feed. <br>
ROSE: Yeah. I think they mean us. <br>
(The Ood enter and Rose and the Doctor back away.) <br>
ALL OOD: We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. <br>
(More Ood enter from other doors. The Doctor gets out his sonic
screwdriver while Rose picks up a chair.) <br>
ALL OOD: We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We
must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We
must feed. <br>
OOD: We must feed. <br>
(It taps the globe.) <br>
OOD: You, if you are hungry. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry? <br>
OOD: We apologise. Electromagnetics have interfered with speech
systems. Would you like some refreshment? <br>
DOCTOR: Er <br>
COMPUTER: Open door 18. <br>
(Humans enter.) <br>
JEFFERSON: What the hell? How did? <br>
(The Ood make way for the newcomers. The lead man uses a wrist-comm.) <br>
JEFFERSON: Captain, you're not going to believe this. We've got people.
Out of nowhere. I mean, real people. I mean two living people, just
standing here right in front of me. <br>
ZACH [OC]: Don't be stupid, that's impossible. <br>
JEFFERSON: I suggest telling them that. <br>
ROSE: But you're a sort of space base. You must have visitors now and
then. It can't be that impossible. <br>
JEFFERSON: You're telling me you don't know where you are? <br>
DOCTOR: No idea. More fun that way. <br>
(A woman's voice makes a broadcast.) <br>
SCOOTI [on tannoy]: Stand by, everyone. Buckle down. We have incoming.
And it's a big one. Quake point five on its way. <br>
(Jefferson opens a door.) <br>
JEFFERSON: Through here, now. Quickly, come on! Move! </font></p>

working at control panels.) <br>
ZACH: Oh, my God. You meant it. <br>
SCOOTI: People! Look at that, real people! <br>
DOCTOR: That's us. Hooray! <br>
ROSE: Yeah, definitely real. My name's Rose. Rose Tyler. And, and this
is the Doctor. <br>
DANNY: Come on the oxygen must be offline. We're hallucinating. They
can't be. No, they're real. <br>
ZACH: Come on, we're in the middle of an alert! Danny, strap up. The
quake's coming in! Impact in thirty seconds! Sorry you two, whoever you
are. Just hold on, tight. <br>
ROSE: Hold on to what? <br>
ZACH: Anything. I don't care. Just hold on. Ood, are we fixed? <br>
OOD: Your kindness in this emergency is much appreciated. <br>
DOCTOR: What's this planet called, anyway? <br>
IDA: Now, don't be stupid. It hasn't got a name. How could it have a
name? You really don't know, do you? <br>
ZACH: And impact! <br>
(The whole place shakes for a few seconds.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well, that wasn't so bad. <br>
(And again, much worse. Consoles burst into flames.) <br>
ZACH: Okay, that's it. Everyone all right? Speak to me, Ida. <br>
IDA: Yeah, yeah! <br>
ZACH: Danny? <br>
DANNY: Fine. <br>
ZACH: Toby? <br>
TOBY: Yeah, fine. <br>
ZACH: Scooti? <br>
SCOOTI: No damage. <br>
ZACH: Jefferson? <br>
JEFFERSON: Check! <br>
DOCTOR: We're fine, thanks, fine. Yeah, don't worry about us. <br>
ZACH: The surface caved in. <br>
(He looks up at a schematic of the base.) <br>
ZACH: I deflected it onto storage five through eight. We've lost them
completely. Toby, go and check the rocket link. <br>
TOBY: That's not my department. <br>
ZACH: Just do as I say, yeah? <br>
(Toby leaves.) <br>
IDA: Oxygen holding. Internal gravity fifty six point six. We should be
okay. <br>
ROSE: Never mind the earthquake, that's, that's one hell of a storm.
What is that, a hurricane? <br>
SCOOTI: You'd need an atmosphere for a hurricane. There's no air out
there. It's a complete vacuum. <br>
ROSE: Then what's shaking the roof? <br>
IDA: You're not joking. You really don't know. Well introductions. F Y
I, as they said in the olden days. I'm Ida Scott, science officer.
Zachary Cross Flane, acting Captain, sir. You've met Mister Jefferson,
he's Head of Security. Danny Bartock, Ethics committee. <br>
DANNY: Not as boring as it sounds. <br>
IDA: And that man who just left, that was Toby Zed, Archaeology, and
this is Scooti Manista, Trainee maintenance. And this? This is home. <br>
(Ida pulls down a lever.) <br>
ZACH: Brace yourselves. The sight of it sends some people mad. <br>
(The shutters overhead pull back to reveal a white hot, angry, disc
with a black centre and black dots falling into it.) <br>
ROSE: That's a black hole. <br>
DOCTOR: But that's impossible. <br>
ZACH: I did warn you. <br>
DOCTOR: We're standing under a black hole. <br>
IDA: In orbit. <br>
DOCTOR: But we can't be <br>
IDA: You can see for yourself. We're in orbit. <br>
DOCTOR: But we can't be. <br>
IDA: This lump of rock is suspended in perpetual geostationary orbit
around that black hole without falling in. Discuss. <br>
ROSE: And that's bad, yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: Bad doesn't cover it. A black hole's a dead star. It collapses
in on itself, in and in and in until the matter's so dense and tight it
starts to pull everything else in too. Nothing in the universe can
escape it. Light, gravity, time. Everything just gets pulled inside and
crushed. <br>
ROSE: So, they can't be in orbit. We should be pulled right in. <br>
DOCTOR: We should be dead. <br>
IDA: And yet here we are, beyond the laws of physics. Welcome on board.
<br>
ROSE: But if there's no atmosphere out there, what's that? <br>
IDA: Stars breaking up. Gas clouds. We have whole solar systems being
ripped apart above our heads, before falling into that thing. <br>
ROSE: So, a bit worse than a storm, then. <br>
IDA: Just a bit. <br>
ROSE: Just a bit, yeah. <br>
(Another shake.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Toby enters a corridor with door 28 at the end,
with scrolls tucked under his arm.) <br>
VOICE [OC]: Toby. <br>
(The lights flicker.) <br>
TOBY: Who's that? Danny? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Control room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COMPUTER: Close door 1. <br>
TOBY: The rocket link's fine. <br>
(Zach calls up a hologram over the central console.) <br>
ZACH: That's the black hole, officially designated K three seven Gen
five. <br>
IDA: In the scriptures of the Falltino, this planet is called Kroptor,
the bitter pill. And the black hole is supposed to be a mighty demon.
It was tricked into devouring the planet, only to spit it out, because
it was poison. <br>
ROSE: The bitter pill. I like that. <br>
DOCTOR: We are so far out. Lost in the drifts of the universe. How did
you even get here?! <br>
ZACH: We flew in. You see, this planet's generating a gravity field. We
don't know how. We've no idea. But it's kept in constant balance
against the black hole. And the field extends out there as a funnel. A
distinct gravity funnel, reaching out into clear space. That was our
way in. <br>
ROSE: You flew down that thing? Like a rollercoaster. <br>
ZACH: By rights, the ship should have been torn apart. We lost the
Captain, which is what put me in charge. <br>
IDA: You're doing a good job. <br>
ZACH: Yeah, well, needs must. <br>
DANNY: But if that gravity funnel closes, there's no way out. <br>
SCOOTI: We had fun speculating about that. <br>
DANNY: Oh, yeah. That's the word. Fun. <br>
DOCTOR: But that field would take phenomenal amounts of power. I mean
not just big, but off the scale! Can I? <br>
IDA: Sure. Help yourself. <br>
(An Ood gives Rose a plastic cup of drink.) <br>
OOD: Your refreshment. <br>
ROSE: Oh, yeah. Thanks. Thank you. I'm sorry, what was your name? <br>
OOD: We have no titles. We are as one. <br>
ROSE: Er, what are they called? <br>
DANNY: Oh, come on. Where have you been living? Everyone's got one. <br>
ROSE: Well, not me, so, what are they? <br>
DANNY: They're the Ood. <br>
ROSE: The Ood? <br>
DANNY: The Ood. <br>
ROSE: Well that's ood. <br>
DANNY: Very ood, but handy. They work the mine shafts. All the drilling
and stuff. Supervision and maintenance. They're born for it. Basic
slave race. <br>
ROSE: You've got slaves? <br>
SCOOTI: Don't start. She's like one of that lot. Friends of the Ood. <br>
ROSE: Well maybe I am, yeah. Since when do humans need slaves? <br>
DANNY: But the Ood offer themselves. If you don't give them orders,
they just pine away and die. <br>
ROSE: Seriously, you like being ordered about? <br>
OOD: It is all we crave. <br>
ROSE: Why's that, then? <br>
OOD: We have nothing else in life. <br>
ROSE: Yeah, well, I used to think like that, a long time ago. <br>
DOCTOR: There we go. Do you see? To generate that gravity field, and
the funnel, you'd need a power source with an inverted self
extrapolating reflex of six to the power of six every six seconds. <br>
ROSE: That's a lot of sixes. <br>
DOCTOR: And it's impossible. <br>
ZACH: It took us two years to work that out <br>
DOCTOR: I'm very good. <br>
IDA: But that's why we're here. This power source is ten miles below
through solid rock. Point Zero. We're drilling down to try and find it.
<br>
ZACH: It's giving off readings of over ninety stats on the Blazon
scale. <br>
IDA: It could revolutionise modern science. <br>
JEFFERSON: We could use it to fuel the Empire. <br>
DOCTOR: Or start a war. <br>
TOBY: It's buried beneath us, in the darkness, waiting. <br>
ROSE: What's your job, chief dramatist? <br>
TOBY: Well, whatever it is down there is not a natural phenomena. And
this, er, planet once supported life eons ago, before the human race
had even learned to walk. <br>
DOCTOR: I saw that lettering written on the wall. Did you do that? <br>
TOBY: I copied it from fragments we found unearthed by the drilling,
but I can't translate it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, neither can I. And that's saying something. <br>
TOBY: There was some form of civilisation. They buried something. Now
it's reaching out, calling us in. <br>
DOCTOR: And you came. <br>
IDA: Well, how could we not? <br>
DOCTOR: So, when it comes right down to it, why did you come here? Why
did you do that? Why? I'll tell you why. Because it was there.
Brilliant. Excuse me, er, Zach, wasn't it? <br>
ZACH: That's me. <br>
DOCTOR: Just stand there, because I'm going to hug you. Is that all
right? <br>
ZACH: I suppose so. <br>
DOCTOR: Here we go. Come on, then. <br>
(The Doctor hugs Zach.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, human beings. You are amazing! Ha! Thank you. <br>
ZACH: Not at all. <br>
DOCTOR: But apart from that, you're completely mad. You should pack
your bags, get back in that ship and fly for your lives. <br>
IDA: You can talk. And how the hell did you get here? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I've got this er, this ship. It's hard to explain. It just
sort of appears. <br>
ROSE: We can show you, we parked down the corridor from er. Oh, what's
it called? Habitation area <br>
DOCTOR: Three. <br>
ROSE: Three. Three. <br>
ZACH: Do you mean storage six? <br>
DOCTOR: It was a bit of a cupboard, yeah. Storage six. But you said.
You said. You said storage five to eight. <br>

fallen down right into the heart of the planet. But you've got robot
drills heading the same way. <br>
ZACH: We can't divert the drilling. <br>
DOCTOR: But I need my ship. It's all I've got. Literally the only
thing. <br>
ZACH: Doctor, we've only got the resources to drill one central shaft
down to the power source, and that's it. No diversions, no
distractions, no exceptions. Your machine is lost. All I can do is
offer you a lift if we ever get to leave this place, and that is the
end of it. <br>

DANNY: The mysterious couple. How are you, then? Settling in? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Sorry, straight to business, the Ood how do they
communicate? I mean, with each other. <br>
DANNY: Oh, just empaths. There's a low level telepathic field
connecting them. Not that that does them much good. They're basically a
herd race. Like cattle. <br>
(The Ood are sitting on benches down below Danny's catwalk.) <br>
DOCTOR: This telepathic field. Can it pick up messages? <br>
ROSE: Because I was having dinner, and one of the Ood said something,
well, odd. <br>
DANNY: Hmm. An odd Ood. <br>
ROSE: And then I got something else on my er, communicator thing. <br>
DANNY: Oh, be fair. We've got whole star systems burning up around us.
There's all sorts of stray transmissions. Probably nothing. Look, if
there was something wrong, it would show. We monitor the telepathic
field. It's the only way to look after them. They're so stupid, they
don't even tell us when they're ill. <br>
DOCTOR: Monitor the field. That's this thing? <br>
(Reading basic 5) <br>
DANNY: Yeah. But like I said, it's low level telepathy. They only
register basic five. <br>

basic thirty. <br>

DANNY: But they can't. <br>
ROSE: Doctor, the Ood. What does basic thirty mean? <br>
DANNY: Well, it means that they're shouting, screaming inside their
heads. <br>
DOCTOR: Or something's shouting at them. <br>

to you? <br>
