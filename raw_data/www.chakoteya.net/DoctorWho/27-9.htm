ROSE: What's the emergency? <br>
DOCTOR: It's mauve. <br>
ROSE: Mauve? <br>
DOCTOR: The universally recognised colour for danger. <br>
ROSE: What happened to red? <br>
DOCTOR: That's just humans. By everyone else's standards, red's camp.
Oh, the misunderstandings. All those red alerts, all that dancing. It's
got a very basic flight computer. I've hacked in, slaved the Tardis.
Where it goes, we go. <br>
ROSE: And that's safe, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Totally. <br>
(Bang!) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, reasonably. Should have said reasonably there. No, no,
no, no! It's jumping time tracks, getting away from us. <br>
ROSE: What exactly is this thing? <br>
DOCTOR: No idea. <br>
ROSE: Then why are we chasing it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's mauve and dangerous, and about thirty seconds from the
centre of London. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis materialises in a back alley between
two terraces. The sort of crowded housing that no longer exists.) <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know how long you can knock around space without
happening to bump into Earth? <br>
ROSE: Five days? Or is that just when we're out of milk? <br>
DOCTOR: Of all the species in all the Universe and it has to come out
of a cow. <br>
(Something is watching them from above.) <br>
DOCTOR: Must have come down somewhere quite close. Within a mile,
anyway. And it can't have been more than a few weeks ago. Maybe a
month. <br>
ROSE: A month? We were right behind it. <br>
DOCTOR: It was jumping time tracks all over the place. We're bound to
be a little bit out. Do you want to drive? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. How much is a little? <br>
DOCTOR: A bit. <br>
ROSE: Is that exactly a bit? <br>
DOCTOR: Ish. <br>
ROSE: What's the plan, then? Are you going to do a scan for alien tech
or something? <br>
DOCTOR: Rose, it hit the middle of London with a very loud bang. I'm
going to ask. <br>
(The Doctor shows Rose his psychic paper ID for the occasion.) <br>
ROSE: Doctor John Smith, Ministry of Asteroids. <br>
DOCTOR: It's psychic paper. It tells you <br>
ROSE: Whatever you want it to tell me, I remember. <br>
(They come to a door marked Deliveries Only.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. <br>
ROSE: Not very Spock, is it, just asking. <br>
DOCTOR: Door, music, people. What do you think? <br>
ROSE: I think you should do a scan for alien tech. Give me some Spock,
for once. Would it kill you? <br>
(The Doctor opens the door with the sonic screwdriver, and looks at
Rose's Union Flag top.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you sure about that t-shirt? <br>
ROSE: Too early to say. I'm taking it out for a spin. <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? Mummy? <br>
DOCTOR: Come on if you're coming. It won't take a minute. <br>

for a mo? Be very quick. Hello! Might seem like a stupid question, but
has anything fallen from the sky recently? <br>
(Silence, then laughter.)

her.) <br>
CHILD: Mummy? <br>
ROSE: Okay, hang on. Don't move! <br>
(Suddenly a rope dangles down in front of Rose. She takes hold of it
and pulls. It seems secure.)
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Sorry, have I said something funny? It's
just, there's this thing that I need to find. Would've fallen from the
sky a couple of days ago. <br>

DOCTOR: Would've landed quite near here. With a very loud <br>
MAN: Quickly as you can, down to the shelter. <br>

warning!) <br>
DOCTOR: Bang.

child.) <br>
CHILD: Mummy. Balloon! <br>
(The barrage balloon drifts, pulling Rose away from the wall and the
child, and dangling her over the alleyway.) <br>
ROSE: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! <br>
(Searchlights comb the sky. Explosions and fires start in various parts
of London. A squadron of German planes head for her.) <br>
ROSE: Okay, maybe not this t-shirt.

(A cat meows.) <br>
DOCTOR: You know, one day, just one day, maybe, I'm going to meet
someone who gets the whole don't wander off thing. Nine hundred years
of phone box travel, it's the only thing left to surprise me.<br>
(The Tardis police telephone rings. He opens the small door.) <br>
DOCTOR: How can you be ringing? What's that about, ringing? What am I
supposed to do with a ringing phone? <br>
(He gets out his sonic screwdriver. A young woman has walked up the
alley.) <br>
NANCY: Don't answer it. It's not for you. <br>
DOCTOR: And how do you know that? <br>
NANCY: 'Cos I do. And I'm telling you, don't answer it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you know so much, tell me this. How can it be ringing?
It's not even a real phone. It's not connected, it's not <br>

DOCTOR: Hello? Hello? This is the Doctor speaking. How may I help you? <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? Mummy? <br>
DOCTOR: Who is this? Who's speaking? <br>
CHILD [OC]: Are you my mummy? <br>
DOCTOR: Who is this? <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? <br>
DOCTOR: How did you ring here? This isn't a real phone. It's not wired
up to anything. <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? <br>
(The dialling tone. The Doctor knocks on the Tardis door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rose? Rose, are you in there? <br>
(He hears a noise and runs out of the alley.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MRS LLOYD [OC]: The planes are coming. Can't you
hear them? Into the shelter. None of your nonsense, now move it! <br>
(The Doctor climbs onto a dustbin and looks over the wall into a back
garden, where a well-fed middle-aged woman is shepherding a young boy
into an
air raid shelter.) <br>
MRS LLOYD: Come on, hurry up, get in there. Come on. Arthur! Arthur,
Will you hurry up? Didn't you hear the siren? <br>
(Her equally well-fed husband comes out of the house.) <br>
LLOYD: Middle of dinner, every night. Blooming Germans. Don't you eat? <br>
MRS LLOYD: I can hear the planes! <br>
LLOYD: Don't you eat? <br>
MRS LLOYD: Oh, keep your voice down, will you? It's an air raid! Get
in. Look, there's a war on. <br>
LLOYD: I know there's a war on. Don't push me. <br>
(With the family safely in the shelter, the Doctor watches Nancy enter
the garden and go into the house. Once in the kitchen, she starts
taking tinned goods from a cupboard. <br>
Meanwhile, dangling over the Thames near St Paul's, Rose has an
excellent view of a typical night raid during the Blitz.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(An officer in a great coat stands on a balcony
using a pair of very non-WW2 binoculars. He spots Rose in her
predicament.) <br>
OFFICER: Get those lights out, please. Everyone down to the shelter. <br>
ALGY: Jack? Are you going down to the shelter? Only I've got to go off
on some silly guard duty. Ah, barrage balloon, eh? Must've come loose.
Happens now and then. Don't you RAF boys use them for target practice? <br>
(Jack zooms in on Rose's derriere and speaks with an American accent.
Everyone say Hi! to

Barrowman</a>.) <br>
JACK: Excellent bottom. <br>
ALGY: I say, old man, there's a time and a place. Look, you should
really be off. <br>
JACK: Sorry, old man. I've got to go meet a girl. But you've got an
excellent bottom too.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Nancy finishes filling her little sack with
provisions and heads for the front door. In the hallway she stops and
looks into another room and smiles, then goes outside into the street,
where she whistles twice then goes back inside. A pair of urchins run
in to see the feast she's discovered.) <br>
NANCY: Many kids out there? <br>
JIM: Yes, miss. <br>
(Jim and his friend dive for the food.) <br>
NANCY: Ah! Still carving. Sit and wait. We've got the whole air raid. <br>
JIM: Look at that. Bet it's off the black market. <br>
NANCY: That's enough.

on the thick rope. Screaming, she falls, and is caught in a beam.) <br>
JACK [OC]: Okay, okay, I've got you. <br>
ROSE: Who's got me? Who's got me, and you know, how? <br>
JACK [OC]: I'm just programming your descent pattern. Keep as still as
you can and keep your hands and feet inside the light field. <br>
ROSE: Descent pattern? <br>
JACK [OC]: Oh, and could you switch off your cell phone? No, seriously,
it interferes with my instrument. <br>
ROSE: You know, no one ever believes that. <br>
(Rose turns off her phone.) <br>
JACK [OC]: Thank you. That's much better. <br>
ROSE: Oh, yeah, that's a real load off, that is. I'm hanging in the sky
in the middle of a German air raid with the Union Jack across my chest,
but hey, my mobile phone's off. <br>

can scramble your head just a little. <br>

thorough. <br>

ROSE: Fine. <br>
(Jack puts Rose down.) <br>
ROSE: Why, are you expecting me to faint or something? <br>
JACK: You look a little dizzy. <br>

street to join the feast.) <br>
ERNIE: It's got to be black market. You couldn't get all this on
coupons. <br>
NANCY: Ernie, how many times? We are guests in this house. We will not
make comments of that kind. Washing up. <br>
(The children laugh.) <br>
ERNIE: Oh, Nancy. <br>
NANCY: Haven't seen you at one of these before. <br>
BOY: He told me about it. <br>
NANCY: Sleeping rough? <br>
BOY: Yes, miss. <br>
NANCY: All right, then. One slice each, and I want to see everyone
chewing properly. <br>
(A plate of slices of meat is handed round.) <br>
JIM: Thank you, miss. <br>
ERNIE: Thanks, miss. <br>
BOY: Thank you miss. <br>
DOCTOR: Thanks, miss! <br>
(The children panic.) <br>
NANCY: It's all right. Everybody stay where you are! <br>
DOCTOR: Good here, innit? Who's got the salt? <br>
NANCY: Back in your seats. He shouldn't be here either. <br>
DOCTOR: So, you lot, what's the story? <br>
ERNIE: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: You're homeless, right? Living rough? <br>
JIM: Why do you want to know that? Are you a copper? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course I'm not a copper. What's a copper going to do with
you lot anyway? Arrest you for starving? I make it 1941. You lot
shouldn't even be in London. You should've been evacuated to the
country by now. <br>
ALF: I was evacuated. Sent me to a farm. <br>
DOCTOR: So why'd you come back? <br>
ALF: There was a man there <br>
JIM: Yeah, same with Ernie. Two homes ago. <br>
ERNIE: Shut up. It's better on the streets anyway. It's better food. <br>
JIM: Yeah. Nancy always gets the best food for us. <br>
DOCTOR: So, that's what you do, is it, Nancy? <br>
NANCY: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: As soon as the sirens go, you find a big fat family meal still
warm on the table with everyone down in the air raid shelter and bingo!
Feeding frenzy for the homeless kids of London Town. Puddings for all,
as long as the bombs don't get you. <br>
NANCY: Something wrong with that? <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong with it? It's brilliant. I'm not sure if it's Marxism in
action or a West End musical. <br>
NANCY: Why'd you follow me? What do you want? <br>
DOCTOR: I want to know how a phone that isn't a phone gets a phone
call. You seem to be the one to ask. <br>
NANCY: I did you a favour. I told you not to answer it, that's all I'm
telling you. <br>
DOCTOR: Great, thanks. And I want to find a blonde in a Union Jack. I
mean a specific one. I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving.
Anybody seen a girl like that? <br>
(Nancy takes the Doctor's plate away.) <br>
DOCTOR: What have I done wrong? <br>
NANCY: You took two slices. No blondes, no flags. Anything else before
you leave? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, there is actually. Thanks for asking. Something I've been
looking for. Would've fallen from the sky about a month ago, but not a
bomb. Not the usual kind, anyway. Wouldn't have exploded. Probably
would have just buried itself in the ground somewhere, and it would
have looked something like this. <br>
(The Doctor holds up a rough sketch of the craft the Tardis was
following. Basically, a tube. A knock on the door makes everyone jump.)
<br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? Are you in there, mummy? <br>
(The Doctor looks out of the window. It's the boy in the gas mask.) <br>
CHILD [OC]: Mummy? <br>
NANCY: Who was the last one in? <br>
ERNIE: Him. <br>
NANCY: No, he came round the back. Who came in the front? <br>

NANCY: Goodnight, Mister. <br>
DOCTOR: Nancy, there's something chasing you and the other kids. Looks
like a boy and it isn't a boy, and it started about a month ago, right?
The thing I'm looking for, the thing that fell from the sky, that's
when it landed. And you know what I'm talking about, don't you? <br>
NANCY: There was a bomb. A bomb that wasn't a bomb. Fell the other end
of Limehouse Green Station. <br>
DOCTOR: Take me there. <br>
NANCY: There's soldiers guarding it. Barbed wire. You'll never get
through. <br>
DOCTOR: Try me. <br>
NANCY: You sure you want to know what's going on in there? <br>
DOCTOR: I really want to know. <br>
NANCY: Then there's someone you need to talk to first. <br>
DOCTOR: And who might that be? <br>
NANCY: The Doctor.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[On Jack's spaceship]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: You know, it's getting a bit late. I should
really be getting back. <br>
JACK: We're discussing business. <br>
ROSE: This isn't business. This is champagne. <br>
JACK: I try never to discuss business with a clear head. Are you
travelling alone? Are you authorised to negotiate with me? <br>
ROSE: What would we be negotiating? <br>
JACK: I have something for the Time Agency. Something they'd like to
buy. Are you in power to make payment? <br>
ROSE: Well, I, I should talk to my companion. <br>
JACK: Companion? <br>
ROSE: I should really be getting back to him. <br>
JACK: Him? <br>
ROSE: Do you have the time? <br>
(Jack uses his remote. The clock face lights up and Big Ben strikes
nine thirty.) <br>
ROSE: Okay, that was flash. That was on the flash side. <br>
JACK: So when you say your companion, just how disappointed should I
be? <br>
ROSE: Okay, we're standing in midair. <br>
JACK: Mmm-hmm. <br>
ROSE: On a spaceship, during a German air raid. Do you really think
now's a good time to be coming on to me ? <br>
JACK: Perhaps not. <br>
ROSE: It was just a suggestion. <br>
JACK: Do you like Glenn Miller? <br>
(The magic remote again. Moonlight Serenade plays. Jack takes Rose in
his arms and they dance.) <br>
JACK: It's 1941, the height of the London Blitz, the height of the
German bombing campaign, and something else has fallen on London. A
fully equipped Chula warship. The last one in existence, armed to the
teeth. And I know where it is, because I parked it. If the Agency can
name the right price, I can get it for you. But in two hours, a German
bomb is
going to fall on it and destroy it forever. That's your deadline.
That's the deal. Now, shall we discuss payment? <br>
ROSE: Do you know what I think? <br>
JACK: What? <br>
ROSE: I think you were talking just then. <br>
JACK: Two hours, the bomb falls. There'll be nothing left but dust and
a crater. <br>
ROSE: Promises, promises. <br>
JACK: Are you listening to any of this? <br>
ROSE: You used to be a Time Agent, now you're some kind of freelancer. <br>
JACK: Well, that's a little harsh. I like to think of myself as a
criminal. <br>
ROSE: I bet you do. <br>
JACK: So, this companion of yours, does he handle the business? <br>
ROSE: Well, I delegate a lot of that, yeah. <br>
JACK: Well, maybe we should go find him. <br>
ROSE: And how're you going to do that? <br>
JACK: Easy. I'll do a scan for alien tech. <br>
ROSE: Finally, a professional.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor uses super-binoculars to scan the
area.) <br>
NANCY: The bomb's under that tarpaulin. They put the fence up over
night. See that building? The hospital. <br>
DOCTOR: What about it? <br>
NANCY: That's where the doctor is. You should talk to him. <br>
DOCTOR: For now, I'm more interested in getting in there. <br>
NANCY: Talk to the doctor first. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
NANCY: Because then maybe you won't want to get inside. <br>
DOCTOR: Where're you going? <br>
NANCY: There was a lot of food in that house. I've got mouths to feed.
Should be safe enough now. <br>
DOCTOR: Can I ask you a question? Who did you lose? <br>
NANCY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The way you look after all those kids. It's because you lost
somebody, isn't it? You're doing all this to make up for it. <br>
NANCY: My little brother. Jamie. One night I went out looking for food.
Same night that thing fell. I told him not to follow me, I told him it
was dangerous, but he just. He just didn't like being on his own. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened? <br>
NANCY: In the middle of an air raid? What do you think happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Amazing. <br>
NANCY: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: 1941. Right now, not very far from here, the German war machine
is rolling up the map of Europe. Country after country, falling like
dominoes. Nothing can stop it. Nothing. Until one, tiny, damp little
island says no. No. Not here. A mouse in front of a lion. You're
amazing, the lot of you.
Don't know what you do to Hitler, but you frighten the hell out of me.
Off you go then do what you've
got to do. Save the world. <br>
(Something watches Nancy walk away.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Albion Hospital ward]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to open the
padlock on the ornate metal gates to the hospital grounds. Inside the
long, dark wards, every bed has a very still patient in it, and they
are all wearing gasmasks. An elderly, grumpy doctor appears, leaning on
a walking stick.) <br>
CONSTANTINE: You'll find them everywhere. In every bed, in every ward.
Hundreds of them. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I saw. Why are they still wearing gas masks? <br>
CONSTANTINE: They're not. Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm, er. Are you the doctor? <br>
CONSTANTINE: Doctor Constantine. And you are? <br>
DOCTOR: Nancy sent me. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Nancy? That means you must've been asking about the bomb. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
CONSTANTINE: What do you know about it? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Why I was asking. What do you know? <br>
CONSTANTINE: Only what it's done. <br>
DOCTOR: These people, they were all caught up in the blast? <br>
CONSTANTINE: None of them were. <br>
(The doctor chuckles then coughs. He sits in a chair by the desk where
the ward sister would usually be.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're very sick. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Dying, I should think. I just haven't been able to find
the time. Are you a doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I have my moments. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Have you examined any of them yet? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Don't touch the flesh. <br>
DOCTOR: Which one? <br>
CONSTANTINE: Any one. <br>
(The Doctor points his sonic screwdriver at the nearest patient.) <br>
CONSTANTINE: Conclusions? <br>
DOCTOR: Massive head trauma, mostly to the left side. Partial collapse
of the chest cavity, mostly to the right. There's some scarring on the
back of the hand and the gas mask seems to be fused to the flesh, but I
can't see any burns. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Examine another one. <br>
DOCTOR: This isn't possible. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Examine another. <br>
DOCTOR: This isn't possible. <br>
CONSTANTINE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: They've all got the same injuries. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly the same. <br>
CONSTANTINE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Identical, all of them, right down to the scar on the back of
the hand. <br>
(Doctor Constantine also has that scar.) <br>
DOCTOR: How did this happen? How did it start? <br>
CONSTANTINE: When that bomb dropped, there was just one victim. <br>
DOCTOR: Dead? <br>
CONSTANTINE: At first. His injuries were truly dreadful. By the
following morning, every doctor and nurse who had treated him, who had
touched him, had those exact same injuries. By the morning after that,
every patient in the same ward, the exact same injuries. Within a week,
the entire hospital. Physical injuries as plague. Can you explain that?
What would you say was the cause of death? <br>
DOCTOR: The head trauma. <br>
CONSTANTINE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Asphyxiation. <br>
CONSTANTINE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: The collapse of the chest cavity <br>
CONSTANTINE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. What was the cause of death? <br>
CONSTANTINE: There wasn't one. They're not dead. <br>
(He hits a waste basket with his stick and the noise makes the patients
sit up in their beds.) <br>
CONSTANTINE: It's all right. They're harmless. They just sort of sit
there. No heartbeat, no life signs of any kind. They just don't die. <br>
DOCTOR: And they've just been left here? Nobody's doing anything? <br>
(The patients lie down again.) <br>
CONSTANTINE: I try and make them comfortable. What else is there? <br>
DOCTOR: Just you? You're the only one here? <br>
CONSTANTINE: Before this war began, I was a father and a grandfather.
Now I am neither. But I'm still a doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. I know the feeling. <br>
CONSTANTINE: I suspect the plan is to blow up the hospital and blame it
on a German bomb. <br>
DOCTOR: Probably too late. <br>
CONSTANTINE: No. There are isolated cases. Isolated cases breaking out
all over London. Stay back, stay back. Listen to me. Top floor. Room
eight oh two. That's where they took the first victim, the one from the
crash site. And you must find Nancy again. <br>
DOCTOR: Nancy? <br>
CONSTANTINE: It was her brother. She knows more than she's saying. She
won't tell me, but she might Mummy. Are you my mummy? <br>
(Starting with the mouth, Doctor Contantine's face turns into a
gasmask.) <br>

Jack Harkness. I've been hearing all about you on the way over. <br>

JACK: And it's a real pleasure to meet you, Mister Spock. <br>
(Jack walks forward to the ward.) <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Spock? <br>
ROSE: What was I supposed to say? You don't have a name. Don't you ever
get tired of Doctor? Doctor who? <br>
DOCTOR: Nine centuries in, I'm coping. Where've you been? We're in the
middle of a London Blitz. It's not a good time for a stroll. <br>

air raid. <br>

JACK: This just isn't possible. How did this happen? <br>
DOCTOR: What kind of Chula ship landed here? <br>
JACK: What? <br>
ROSE: He said it was a warship. He stole it, parked it somewhere out
there, somewhere a bomb's
going to fall on it unless we make him an offer. <br>
DOCTOR: What kind of warship? <br>
JACK: Does it matter? It's got nothing to do with this. <br>
DOCTOR: This started at the bomb site. It's got everything to do with
it. What kind of warship? <br>
JACK: An ambulance! Look. <br>
(Jack produces a hologram of it from his wrist device.) <br>
JACK: That's what you chased through the Time Vortex. It's space junk.
I wanted to kid you it was valuable. It's empty. I made sure of it.
Nothing but a shell. I threw it at you. Saw your time travel vehicle,
love the retro look, by the way, nice panels. Threw you the bait <br>
ROSE: Bait? <br>
JACK: I wanted to sell it to you and then destroy it before you found
out it was junk. <br>
ROSE: You said it was a war ship. <br>
JACK: They have ambulances in wars. It was a con. I was conning you.
That's what I am, I'm a con man. I thought you were Time Agents. You're
not, are you. <br>
ROSE: Just a couple more freelancers. <br>
JACK: Oh. Should have known. The way you guys are blending in with the
local colour. I mean, Flag Girl was bad enough, but U-Boat Captain?
Anyway, whatever's happening here has got nothing to do with that ship.
