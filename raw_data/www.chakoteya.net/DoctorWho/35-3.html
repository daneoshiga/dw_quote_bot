journal of Captain Jonathan Moran, 21st November 2119. We have located
a craft of unknown origin on the lake floor. Visual scans in situ
revealed nothing, so we have brought the craft
on board and myself and the crew will now investigate.

mystery craft is a cross between Thunderbird Four and a Star Trek space
shuttle - there are steps on the back hatch which has lowered as a ramp
up into a singe empty compartment with one large rectangular object
inside. Moran is a large man standing just inside it.)<br>MORAN: How did they miss this in the initial survey? <br>LUNN: Cass says it was buried, and then&nbsp;the currents of the water must have
shifted the rubble around. <br>(Cass is a deaf lady who uses sign 
language, and Lunn is her interpreter. Another man wearing glasses - 
Bennett - is scanning with a Geiger counter.)<br>PRITCHARD: A conversation needs to be had about who owns this spaceship. <br>
MORAN: Can we stop calling it a spaceship? We don't know what it is. <br>PRITCHARD: A case could be made that this is an asset, and my company has bought
the rights to all assets&nbsp; <br>MORAN: Whoa, whoa. What's this? Lunn, grab me a torch, will you? <br>(There are four strange symbols apparently scratched into the port side of the inner hull.)<br>MORAN: It was found on MOD property, even if that property is underwater. <br>(Lunn
goes to a wall cabinet and we see something flash past at speed. When
he shuts the cabinet door a face is briefly seen behind his own, but as
he turns around there is no one there.)<br>MORAN: What
you bought is the oil under the ground. Lunn! Where's the torch? <br>(O'Donnell,
a young lady with pony tail and baseball cap, gets the torch from Lunn
and hands it to Moran. He shines it on the symbols and we see them in
his eyes. The two of them leave the vessel.)<br>CASS via LUNN: Can I go in? <br>MORAN: What is the radiation count? <br>BENNETT: Pretty much background level. <br>O'DONNELL: Anything more, it would have shown up on
the initial survey twenty years ago. <br>LUNN: (signs to Cass) If it's not safe, how come you can go in? <br>CASS via LUNN:&nbsp;How long do you think it's been down here? <br>BENNETT: Well, there's next to no corrosion. I've not seen technology like
this&nbsp; <br>MORAN: Please don't say&nbsp;on Earth.<br>BENNETT: On Earth before. <br>
(O'Donnell laughs.)<br>MORAN: (sighs) Maybe it's some kind of experimental craft that got left behind when
they abandoned the site. <br>BENNETT: Wait, you think the Army would just lose a prototype weapon? <br>MORAN: You're new to the military, aren't you, son? <br>LUNN: Cass says he might be right. It might have been here since the 1980s,
when the valley flooded. <br>(Pritchard
is peering at a circular dot design on the forward bulkhead of the
craft, when he sees a hand reach for him. It belongs to a strange
figure in Victorian style clothes and top hat, with long white
sideburns. Then the craft's engines ignite, spurting flame.)<br>MORAN: Cass! <br>(Moran pushes Cass to safety and gets incinerated himself. Alarms sound and everyone flees.)&nbsp;<br>LUNN: Come on! Move! Come on, we need to go now! <br>COMPUTER:&nbsp;Fire in the main hangar. Safety protocols have been
initiated. All crew must evacuate immediately. This safety message was
brought to you by Vector Petroleum.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sealing a doorway.)<br>O'DONNELL: We can't just leave him in there! <br>PRITCHARD: There was something in the spaceship, I saw it! <br>BENNETT: O'Donnell. O'Donnell, he's dead. Didn't you see? <br>LUNN: The fire, are we safe out here? <br>BENNETT: It's fine. The CO2 will put the fire out. <br>O'DONNELL: (to Pritchard) It was you! You were messing about with the controls on that ship! <br>(Cass
looks past them all and screams, and grabs Lunn to protect her. Moran is standing behind them, lips
moving. There are black holes where his eyes should be.)<br>BENNETT: Moran. But, we just saw you&nbsp; <br>O'DONNELL: He's. Oh, my God. He's a&nbsp; ghost.<br>(Moran is joined by the other figure, and they both reach out for the crew.)

 days later, the Tardis materialises. We are shown an overturned chair 
and a base that seems to be empty. The Doctor talks to the Tardis.)<br>DOCTOR: What's wrong? You're not happy. Why aren't you happy? Tell me. <br>CLARA [OC]: Come on! we're on a roll! <br>(She stands in the Tardis doorway.)<br>CLARA: Monsters, things blowing up. Oh, hey, can we
go back to that place where the people with the long necks have been
celebrating New Year for two centuries? I left my sunglasses there. And
most of my dignity. <br>DOCTOR: Why have you brought us here? <br>CLARA: Here being? <br>(She shuts the Tardis door.)<br>DOCTOR: Underwater. Some sort of a base. The technology's twenty second century. Maybe
military, maybe scientific. <br>CLARA: Is there a crew? <br>DOCTOR: Must be, somewhere, if there's oxygen. <br>(They walk down the corridor.)<br>CLARA: I want another adventure. Come on, you feel the same. You're itching to
save a planet, I know it. <br>
(He smiles behind her back.)<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Mess hall]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A big mural of a dragon or
 serpent threatening some men in a small wooden sailing boat. Their 
garments look suspiciously like ST:TNG style, including the colours. 
This is where the overturned chair is, along with a lot of mess.)<br>CLARA: Doctor, look at this. <br>DOCTOR; Well. Looks like you got your wish. <br>
CLARA: Food fight? <br>(A knife is stuck in a wall. Clara twangs it.)<br>DOCTOR: I think there was more to it than that. Whatever it was, it happened
pretty recently. <br>(He sticks his finger into a cup of originally hot liquid.)<br>DOCTOR: Seven or eight hours ago. No bodies, though. <br>CLARA: And they
took provisions. Okay, so something or someone forced the crew to abandon the base. Maybe
they went for a swim in the creepy flooded village outside. <br>(They look through the windows.)<br>CLARA: Oh, yeah. You see, this is more like it. <br>(She holds out her hand for a high five?)<br>CLARA: Oh, come on. Don't leave me hanging. <br>(The Doctor walks out of the room. She follows after a few moments.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]<br></b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Yet another one, but they all look the same.)<br>DOCTOR: Look. Told you. Crew. <br>(Moran and the ghost are squatting on the floor with their backs towards the Doctor and Clara.)<br>DOCTOR: Hello, sailors! <br>(The figures stand and turn, their lips moving.)<br>DOCTOR: Right, I did not expect that. Hands up who expected that. <br>(The figures walk forward.)<br>DOCTOR: Wait, wait. I don't think they're going to hurt us. I think that
they're just curious. <br>(The alien stands nose to nose with the Doctor, while Moran looks down at Clara.)<br>CLARA: Are you sure? <br>DOCTOR: Well, I mean, define sure. Look at you lovely chaps. What's happened
to you, then? <br>(The figures turn away, still muttering to themselves.)<br>DOCTOR: Come on. <br>(The Doctor and Clara follow the figures.)<br>CLARA: What are they? <br>DOCTOR: I haven't a clue. Isn't that exciting?&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Main hangar]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The doors open. The Doctor and Clara enter, and the doors close behind them. The fire has long been extinguished.)<br>CLARA: Where did they go? What is it, some kind of submarine? <br>DOCTOR: No, it's alien. <br>(They
go inside the spaceship. The Doctor runs his hand over the rectangular
object and sees the symbols on the wall. We see them in his eye. He points to them, and Clara
picks up the light and shines it on the markings.)<br>DOCTOR: That's weird. The Tardis hasn't translated it. <br>(A strange, hissing sort of sound. Clara turns.)<br>CLARA: (sotto) Hey, look, they're back. <br>DOCTOR: Hello! Did you want to show us this?
It's very nice. <br>CLARA: Wait, are they saying something? &nbsp;<br>(Moran takes a fire axe from the wall, but it is very heavy for him.)<br>CLARA: Okay, they now appear to be arming themselves. <br>DOCTOR: Yes, I spotted that, too. <br>(They leave the craft as the other ghost takes a harpoon gun.)<br>DOCTOR: Was it something she said? She does that. She once had an argument with
Gandhi! <br>(Moran swings the axe, and just misses.)<br>CLARA: I'm starting to see why the crew did a runner. <br>(The harpoon gun is fired and dodged. The Doctor and Clara run out. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ghosts&nbsp;walk through a wall, but their weapons have to be left behind.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A
hand reaches through the wall next to Clara. She cries out. Moran
emerges, making them back away down the corridor, then the other rises up through the floor behind them. Clara grabs at the
Doctor's arm.)<br>CLARA: Run! <br>(A door at the end of the corridor is opened.)<br>O'DONNELL: In here! Quick!&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Faraday cage]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The ghosts peer in though the round window in the door, but do not enter.

(He shows them his psychic paper.) <br>PRITCHARD: You're from UNIT. <br>DOCTOR: Well, if that's what it says. <br>PRITCHARD: I'm Pritchard, this is Bennett. <br>O'DONNELL: O'Donnell! Are you really the Doctor? I'm a huge fan! I mean, er, you know&nbsp; Nice
work. <br>LUNN: Tim Lunn, I sign for Cass. <br>DOCTOR: Tell me, what about those things out there? What are they? Why are they
trying to kill us? <br>BENNETT: Well, they're er, they're ghosts. <br>DOCTOR: They're not ghosts. <br>LUNN: Cass is saying&nbsp; <br>DOCTOR: Thank you, but I actually don't need your help. I can speak sign.
(signs) Go ahead. <br>
(Cass signs her reply.) <br>DOCTOR: No, no, actually,&nbsp;I can't. It's been deleted for semaphore.
Someone get me a selection of flags. <br>CASS via LUNN: One of the ghosts is our previous commanding officer. The other,
um moley guy, we don't know what he is. <br>DOCTOR: He's from the planet Tivoli. <br>
BENNETT: See? I told you he was an alien. Didn't I say that?
<br>DOCTOR: Weird thing is, they're not violent. They're too cowardly. They
wouldn't say boo to a goose. They're more likely to give the goose
their car keys and bank details.
When did they first appear? <br>O'DONNELL: Oh, did you see that spaceship in the hangar? Yeah, we found that on the lake bed and we'd just got it on board and
one of the engines started up and then Moran got (pause) <br>
Moran was killed. <br>CASS via LUNN: Then they appeared and pretty much straight away started trying to kill
us. So we grabbed what we could and we were looking for somewhere to
hide,
and that's when we realised the ghosts couldn't come in here. <br>CLARA: What is this place? <br>DOCTOR: It's a Faraday cage. Completely impenetrable to radio waves, and
apparently, whatever those things are out there. So, who's in charge now? I need to know who to ignore. <br>CASS via LUNN: That would be me. <br>LUNN: Her. <br>PRITCHARD: Actually, that would be me. <br>(Richard Pritchard, Vice President of Sub-aquatic Resources, hand the Doctor his card.)<br>PRITCHARD: I represent Vector Petroleum. We've
obtained the mining rights to the oil. <br>DOCTOR: The oil? Where are we? <br>
(The Doctor tosses the card on the floor, and Pritchard picks it up again.)<br>BENNETT: This used to be a military training site. There was a dam overlooking
it, but the dam burst and the valley was submerged.
<br>PRITCHARD: Then twenty years ago, we discovered a massive oil reservoir underneath
it. <br>COMPUTER: Good morning. Entering day mode. <br>(The lights brighten.)<br>O'DONNELL: Okay, it's morning. We can go outside now. <br>
LUNN: Thank God for that. <br>
PRITCHARD: At last, we can get out of here. <br>CLARA: Morning? <br>BENNETT: (Taking a towel from a hook.) Yeah, we're too far below the surface for daylight, so we have to
demarcate artificial days and nights. <br>(O'Donnell opens the door.)<br>DOCTOR: I'd like to have a further look at that spaceship, but what about those
things that aren't ghosts? <br>O'DONNELL: Oh, it's all right. They only come out at night. <br>CLARA: (sotto) Weird how that is not comforting.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Main hangar]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: If whatever they are&nbsp; <br>PRITCHARD: They're ghosts.<br>DOCTOR: They're not ghosts. Have been trying to kill you, why haven't you abandoned the base? <br>PRITCHARD: That was my call. We've got about a trillion dollars worth of mining equipment here.
We're not just going to abandon it&nbsp; What? If it all goes pear-shaped, it's not <em>them</em> that lose a bonus. <br>DOCTOR: It's okay. I understand. You're an idiot. Come to mention it, why is
there a Faraday cage on the base? <br>BENNETT: It's the mining equipment. It runs on nuclear fission. The Faraday cage
has been lined with lead to act as a shelter in the event of a
radiation leak. <br>DOCTOR: So, we are fighting an unknown homicidal force that has taken the form of
your commanding officer and a cowardly alien, underwater, in a nuclear
reactor. Anything else I should know? Someone got a peanut allergy, or
something? <br>(The Doctor and Clara go back into the spaceship.)<br>DOCTOR: It all started with this ship. This is where the answer will be. <br>(He looks down at a section of the deck, then removes a hatch.)<br>DOCTOR: What's happened to the stuff you've removed? This is for long-haul
flights. There should be a suspended-animation chamber for the pilot
right here.
Plus, one of the power cells is missing. <br>PRITCHARD: Power cell? <br>(He runs up the steps into the spaceship.)<br>DOCTOR: Yeah. You can see the casing is empty. <br>(Cass and Lunn are having a vigorous discussion.)<br>LUNN: It's not safe out here! <br>CLARA: What's the matter? <br>LUNN: She won't let me look inside the spaceship. She says it's not safe. I'm
saying it's not safe out here. <br>PRITCHARD: I imagine they're pretty valuable. <br>DOCTOR: What? <br>PRITCHARD: I mean powerful. Those power cells. I imagine they're pretty powerful.
<br>DOCTOR: Well, they can zap a vessel from one side of the galaxy to the other, so, you know, take
a wild stab in the dark. <br>PRITCHARD: And the missing one must still be out there. <br>DOCTOR: Yes, well, otherwise. Sorry, why is this man still talking to me? <br>O'DONNELL: We haven't removed anything. There hasn't been time. <br>(Pritchard leaves, then the Doctor leaves the spaceship.)<br>DOCTOR: So what have we got? Moran dies, and then those things appear. They can
walk through walls. They only come out at night and they're sort of
see-through. <br>
CLARA: Doctor, wait, you're not saying&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Computer stations, control panels on walls, and a nice illuminated map of the base.)<br>DOCTOR: They're ghosts! Yeah, ghosts&nbsp; <br>CLARA: You said there was no such thing. You actually pooh-poohed the ghost
theory. <br>DOCTOR:
Yes, well, well, there was no such thing as, as socks or smartphones
and
badgers until there suddenly were. Besides, what else could they be?
They're not holograms, they're not Flesh Avatars, they're not Autons,
they're not digital copies bouncing around the Nethersphere. No, these
people are literally,
actually, dead. Wow. This is, it's amazing! I've never actually met a
proper ghost. <br>CASS via LUNN: Moran was our friend. <br>CLARA: (sotto) The cards.<br>DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, right you are. <br>(He fumbles in his pocket for a set of record cards.) <br>CLARA: (sotto) Oh, come here. <br>(Clara
sorts through them looking for the right one. I completely understand
why it was difficult not to get captured. It was my fault, I should
have known you didn't live in Aberdeen. I didn't mean to imply that I
don't care. No one is going to get eaten / vapourised / exterminated /
upgraded / possessed / mortally wounded turned to jelly we'll all get
out of this unharmed. She clears her throat and hands him the next one.)<br>
DOCTOR: Ahem. I'm very sorry for your loss. I'll do all I can to solve the death of
your friend slash family member slash pet. <br>(Clara gives in a Look and takes the card back.)<br>DOCTOR:
But don't you see what this means? Death! It was the one thing that
unified every single living creature in the universe, and now it's
gone.
How can you just sit there? Don't you want to go out there right now,
wrestle them to the ground and ask them questions until your throat
falls out?
What's death like? Does it hurt? Do you still get hungry? Do you miss
being alive? Why can you only handle metal objects? Oh, I didn't know
I'd noticed that.
Okay, so they'll try to kill you, blah, blah, blah. What does that
matter? You come back. A bit murder-y, sure, but even so! Calm,
Doctor, calm. You were like this when you met Shirley Bassey.
Okay. Question one. What is a ghost? Question two. What do they want?
<br>(The lights go out.)<br>O'DONNELL: Whoa. Whoa, what's happening? <br>COMPUTER:&nbsp;Good evening. Entering night mode.<br>
O'DONNELL: That's not right. We're switching back into night mode
again. This can't happen! No, no, no! <br>(She sits at a computer terminal. Then a distant bell starts to toll.)<br>
BENNETT: Er, what's doing that? <br>CLARA: Doctor? <br>DOCTOR: The Tardis Cloister Bell! <br>(He runs out.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: Doctor, what's wrong? <br>DOCTOR: It must be the ghosts. That's why she was upset when we got here. <br>CLARA: Why? I don't understand. <br>DOCTOR: It's just what I was saying. You live and you die. That's it. The
ghosts are aberrations. A splinter of time in the skin. They're
unnatural.
She wants to get away from them. <br>CLARA: So, what do we do? <br>(The Doctor turns a handle on the console. The Cloister Bell stops and the engines power down.)<br>DOCTOR: Put the handbrake on. <br>(Clara takes off her jacket and heads for the doors.)<br>DOCTOR: Whoa! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Where do you think you're going? <br>CLARA: Out there, where the action is. <br>DOCTOR: Look, you, er&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>CLARA: What? <br>DOCTOR: Oh, this is my own fault. I like adventures as much as the next man.
If the next man is a man who likes adventures. Even so, don't, don't
go native. <br>CLARA: What do you mean? I'm not. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, there's a whole&nbsp;dimension in here, but there's only room for
one <em>me</em>. <br>CLARA: Wait, wait a second. You just raved about ghosts like a kid who had
too much sherbet. <br>DOCTOR: Do you know what you need? You need a hobby.<br>CLARA: I really don't. <br>
DOCTOR: Or even better, another relationship. Come on, you lot, you're bananas
about relationships. You're always writing songs about them, or going to
war, or getting tattooed&nbsp; <br>CLARA: Doctor, I'm fine. <br>DOCTOR: I just felt that I, I, I had to say something. <br>CLARA: I know. And I appreciated it. <br>DOCTOR: Because I've got a duty of care. <br>CLARA: Which you take very seriously, I know. <br>DOCTOR: So can I stop now? <br>CLARA: Please. Please do. <br>(They leave.

settings so they can go about uninhibited, opening the airlocks. They're learning. <br>CLARA: And now there's three of them. <br>BENNETT: Cass, what do we do? <br>CASS via LUNN: We abandon the base. Topside can send down a whole team of marines or ghost-busters or
whatever. <br>DOCTOR: Wait, wait.<br>CASS via LUNN: I can't force you to leave, so you can stay and do the
whole cabin in the woods thing and get killed or drowned, if you want.
But my first priority is to protect my crew. <br>CLARA: (sotto) But we're coming back, aren't we? <br>DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, we're coming back. <br>CASS via LUNN: O'Donnell, contact Topside.

Over. <br>O'DONNELL: Topside, who did you speak to and when was this request made? Over. <br>TOPSIDE [OC]: Drum Control, it was in Morse code and arrived maybe half an hour ago.
Said it was urgent, comms were down, two crew members critically ill,
full paramedic team requested. Over.<br>(The Doctor snatches the handset.) <br>DOCTOR: Topside, this is the Doctor, UNIT security visa seven one zero Apple zero zero. You
may be familiar with my work. Call back the sub. <br>TOPSIDE [OC]:'Doctor, why would <br>DOCTOR: Call it back! We have a hazardous and undefined contagion on board.
This base is now under quarantine. <br>(He puts the handset down.)<br>BENNETT: What did you do that for? <br>DOCTOR: Well, none of us sent the message, did we? So that means that the ghosts sent it,
which means they want that crew down here. <br>LUNN: Why would they do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don't know, but I'm pretty certain it's not so they can all form a
boy band. Okay. We solve this on our own. The ghosts can only come out at night so
they change the base's time settings. Why? What's different at night? <br>O'DONNELL: It's mainly atmospheric. The lights are dim, the noise from the engines
is muffled. <br>DOCTOR: No. Something, something else. <br>CASS via LUNN: The diagnostic sweep. When the systems are checked, that stops at night
to save power. <br>DOCTOR: What systems specifically? <br>O'DONNELL: Life support, the locks. They're electromagnetic. They have to be
secured in case of flooding, so throughout the day, they're checked,
one by one, every few seconds.
<br>DOCTOR: The answer is in there somewhere, I can smell it. <br>CLARA: Doctor, what do we do? <br>DOCTOR: O'Donnell. Excellent work, returning the base to day mode. <br>O'DONNELL: Shut up. It was nothing&nbsp; You really think so? <br>DOCTOR: Now put it back into night mode. <br>O'DONNELL: What!<br>DOCTOR: We know nothing. We don't know what they want. That's what's getting us
killed. Well, I won't run. Not any more. So, O'Donnell, kindly put the
base
back into night mode. We want to know what these ghosts are after? We
ask them. We're going to do the impossible. We're going to capture a
ghost.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Mess hall]</b><br>

that. Over and over. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: They're
coordinates. <br>
BENNETT: How can they be coordinates? <br>
DOCTOR: The dark? Space. So, whoever's following the coordinates knows they're
going to another planet. The sword? <br>
(The Doctor hands out an apple to Bennett, a knobby ball to O'Donnell, a table
 tennis ball to Clara and a Vector Petroleum place mat also to Clara in her right hand, and 
makes them hold them up in a diagonal line.)<br>
DOCTOR: Orion's sword. The sword, the
three stars, although one isn't actually a star but the Orion Nebula,
hanging down from Orion's belt.
But if viewed from back here, the Earth becomes the fourth bit of
the sword. So, narrowed it down to a planet now. Getting closer.<br>
(He retrieves the objects and puts them on the map table.) <br>
DOCTOR: The forsaken. The forsaken or abandoned or empty town. See, it's a
location, beaming out to someone or something across the universe, over
and over. And every time they kill one of us&nbsp; <br>CLARA: It strengthens the signal. Another ghost, another transmitter. <br>
O'DONNELL: Which is
why they sent for that rescue sub. <br>
DOCTOR: Get more people down here,
kill them, make even more ghosts to beam out the coordinates. <br>CASS via LUNN: But why are they beaming out the coordinates? Is it a distress call? <br>DOCTOR: It could be. Or a warning. Might even be a call to arms. It could mean, come here, they're vulnerable, help yourself.
Wait a minute, though.
Wait a minuet. Do you know what this means? It means that they're not a
natural phenomenon.
It means that someone is deliberately getting people killed, hijacking
their souls and turning them into transmitters. <br>O'DONNELL: But what do the coordinates lead <em>to</em>, though? To us? To the ghosts? What? <br>DOCTOR: Ah! What the coordinates are for. That is part of the answer to the
other question you're all thinking.
(blank stares) Really? Come on. None of you? Surely just being around me makes you
cleverer by osmosis? What is the other question? <br>CASS via LUNN: The temple. The fourth part of the directions. What's the temple? <br>DOCTOR: Finally. It's like pulling teeth. This is the flooded military town. Shops, houses, town square, and
this. <br>
CLARA: A church? <br>
(A long narrow building with an annex projecting off at right angles at one end, according to the old aerial photograph.)<br>
DOCTOR: Whatever the coordinates are for, it's in that
church.
Find that and you're a hop, skip and a jump to stopping them. <br>BENNETT: Wait, you're not suggesting that? But we're safe now. The ghosts are in the cage. We can get out of here.
<br>DOCTOR: No one has to stay. In fact, I would prefer it if you went. You'll all
get in the way and ask ridiculous questions. But, you know, (indicates Cass, Lunn and O'Donnell) <em>you</em> have chosen to protect and serve. (indicates Bennett) <em>You</em>
 have given yourself
to science and the pursuit of knowledge.
None of you have chosen anonymous or selfish lives. Go, and a part of
you will always wonder, what would have happened if I'd stayed? How 
could I have helped? What would I have learned? I want you to go.
But you should know what it is that you're leaving. <br>
LUNN: Cass says we should go, but everything that happens here is her
responsibility now, so she's going to stay. So I, er, guess I should
too. <br>O'DONNELL: Well, count me in. Who wants to live forever, anyway? <br>BENNETT: Sorry, er, have you gone insane? We can go home. <br>
(O'Donnell does a one shoulder shrug and grins.)<br>BENNETT: They're ghosts, though. How can they be ghosts? Well, at least if I die, you know I really will come back and haunt
you all. <br>
(Later, Bennett is controlling a drone submarine by virtual reality 
goggles and remote controls on his fingers, left hand for steering, right hand for power.)<br>
BENNETT: Okay, the sub is approaching the town square. Which way is the church? <br>O'DONNELL North-north-west, one hundred and fifty yards. That's it. Starboard two degrees. <br>CLARA: What are we looking for, exactly? <br>DOCTOR: Something that has the power to raise the dead and turn them into
transmitters. I expect we'll know it when we see it. <br>BENNETT: Wait, I've found the church. <br>DOCTOR: That's it, keep going. <br>
(A large white casket is in amongst the debris in the church ground.)<br>DOCTOR: Wait. What's that? Move closer.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: It's the suspended-animation chamber from the spaceship. <br>CLARA: So the pilot could be in there. <br>DOCTOR: There's <em>something</em> inside there. But it's deadlock sealed. I can't open
it. It should be the pilot, it should be. So why do I think it isn't?
More questions. Everything I solve, just more questions. I have to go
back to the beginning. We arrive, we see the ghosts. They don't kill
us.
They lead us here, they show us the spaceship. <em>Then</em> they try to kill
us. <br>
(He goes inside the spaceship and looks at the symbols on the wall.)<br>DOCTOR: Not translated by the Tardis. Why? <br>(He
 cleans his sunglasses and puts them on to look at the scratched marks. 
Whirring. Then he takes them off and comes out into the hangar and speaks to Cass.)<br>DOCTOR: Lunn, translate for me. Whenever I step outside, you are the smartest
person in the room. So, tell me, what's weird about this? I know that
it's all bonkers
but, you know, when <em>you</em> think about it, one thing keeps snagging in
your mind. What is it? <br>CASS via LUNN: The markings on the inside of the spaceship. <br>DOCTOR: The markings on the inside of the spaceship. Yes! Why? <br>CASS via LUNN: I don't think they're just words. <br>DOCTOR: They're not. They're magnets. <br>BENNETT: Magnets? How? <br>DOCTOR: Well, a localised and manufactured electromagnetic field, to be
precise. The dark. The sword. The forsaken. The temple.
When we heard the coordinates for the first time, did anyone expect
them not to be that? No, exactly. Me neither. It's like we already
knew, somehow.
Like the words were already in us. <br>O'DONNELL: So that writing <em>is</em> the coordinates? <br>
DOCTOR: Everything we see or experience shapes us in some way. But these words
actually rewrite the synaptic connections in your brain. They literally
change the way you are wired. Clara, why don't I have a radio in the Tardis? <br>CLARA: You took it apart and used the pieces to make a clockwork squirrel. <br>DOCTOR: <em>And</em> because whatever song I heard first thing in the morning, I was
stuck with. Two weeks of Mysterious Girl by Peter Andre. I was begging
for the brush of Death's merciful hand.
Don't you see? These words are an earworm. A song you can't stop
humming, even after you die. <br>CLARA: Okay, so, the spaceship lands here. The pilot leaves the writing on the
wall so whoever sees it, when they die, they become a beacon of the
coordinates,
while he slash she slash it snoozes in the suspended-animation chamber&nbsp; <br>DOCTOR:
 Waiting for his slash her slash its mates to pick the message up. My 
God. Every time I think it couldn't get more extraordinary, it
surprises me. It's impossible. I hate it. It's evil. It's astonishing.
I want to kiss it to death. <br>(Alarm sounds.)<br>COMPUTER: Attention, all crew. Evacuate base immediately. Emergency
protocols have been initiated. This safety message was brought to you
by Vector Petroleum. Fuel for our futures. <br>
(O'Donnell runs to a wall touch screen. It says Flooding Initiated. Reactor Malfunction. Emergency Cooling.)<br>O'DONNELL: Oh, no. The ghosts tampering with the day-night settings caused a
computer malfunction. Its its first priority is to keep the reactor
cool,
so it's opening the hull doors and it's flooding the base. <br>
(Water gushes into the corridors.)<br>LUNN: Cass says, close the internal flood doors. That'll contain the water in
the central corridor. <br>DOCTOR: Where's the Tardis? <br>O'DONNELL: On the other side.<br>
