<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises in a snow-covered
landscape, played by Bolinge Hill Farm, Buriton, Hampshire. Peri comes
out, dressed for the weather in high-necked blue jacket and black
trousers, and picks her way carefully down a slope towards a pond.) <br>
PERI: I don't believe it. What I'd give for a burger. This is the pits.
With my luck, I'll fall in. Ugh, get that. <br>
(She throws a part eaten bun into the water. The Doctor comes out of
the Tardis wearing a long blue cape.) <br>
DOCTOR: How do I look? <br>
PERI: (sotto) Yuck. (aloud) More comfortable than I feel. This thing
I'm wearing's too tight. <br>
DOCTOR: You eat too much. <br>
PERI: Hardly. I've just given my lunch to the fish. Can't I change into
something more comfortable? <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly not. Blue is the official colour of mourning on
Necros, and women's legs to be covered at all times. <br>
PERI: Sounds positively feudal. <br>
DOCTOR: It's polite, not to say safer, to honour local customs. You
should know that by now. <br>
PERI: I don't even know this guy we've come to see. <br>
DOCTOR: Guy? Guy! You are talking about Professor Arthur Stengos. One
of the finest agronomists in the galaxy. <br>
PERI: I'm sorry. I'm even more sorry he's dead, but that doesn't change
the fact that this is uncomfortable. <br>
(They do not see a hand rise from the water to take Peri's bun, but
they hear the splash.) <br>
PERI: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Do you want me to find out? <br>
PERI: No. <br>
(There's a small eruption of water.) <br>
DOCTOR: Poor old thing. I've warned you about feeding animals. <br>
PERI: That was my lunch. Well, it's the last time I eat any more of
your nut roast rolls. What else is here? <br>
DOCTOR: The odd voltrox, the occasional speelsnape. <br>
PERI: Do they bite? <br>
DOCTOR: Only each other. Come on. <br>
PERI: You didn't warn me about all this snow. <br>

corpse in the Egyptian style.) <br>
JOBEL: Lovely, lovely, lovely. Absolutely lovely. You've excelled
yourself, Mister Takis. You really have. <br>
TAKIS: Thank you, Mister Jobel. <br>
JOBEL This will be the finest perpetual instatement I've ever made,
provided the witch doesn't crumble to dust before we get her
underground.) <br>
(A plain young woman follows the two men down the steps away from the
bier.) <br>
TASAMBEKER: Not with you in charge, Mister Jobel. <br>
JOBEL: What? That was supposed to be a joke. <br>
TASAMBEKER: I'm sorry, Mister Jobel. <br>
JOBEL: This one thinks with her knuckles. I tell you, Takis, after
today we'll go down in funerary history. <br>
(They walk between two lines of tall containers full of blue flowers
and peacock feathers.) <br>
JOBEL: Everyone will want our services. <br>
TAKIS: Let's get the day over with first, Mister Jobel. <br>
JOBEL: Always the cautious one, Takis, but you're absolutely right, of
course. What do you want? You're always under my feet. <br>
TASAMBEKER: I'm sorry, Mister Jobel. I was told to inform you that
surveillance has picked up the presidential spacecraft. <br>
JOBEL: Oh! I hope they're on time. She's already started to froth. We
know what that leads to. Thank goodness that the casket is lead-lined.
I want to see you all in fresh tunic and full funerary make-up before
the president arrives. Don't want the poor thing uncertain who the
corpse is, do we. <br>
(Jobel and most of the workers leave.) <br>
TASAMBEKER: What are you staring at? <br>
TAKIS: You're wasting your time there. He's not interested in you. <br>
TASAMBEKER: Get on with your work. <br>
(Tasambeker leaves. Takis takes a flower from a display, then he and
his friend Lilt go up the steps to the corpse lying in state. A young
woman and a young man quietly make their way across the screen. The
young man is carrying an automatic weapon and a briefcase. They go into
the next room and she consults a map.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Peri make their way through the
landscape, now played by the Queen Elizabeth Country Park, Horndean.) <br>
PERI: This seems to be the only plant that grows in this wilderness. <br>
DOCTOR: Herbabaculum vitae. <br>
PERI: Herbabaculum vitae. Staff of life. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. It's common name is the weed plant. <br>
(Peri looks at the blue flowers on the shrub.) <br>
PERI: Looks sort of familiar. <br>
DOCTOR: It's very similar in food value to the soya bean plant on
Earth. Can't understand why it hasn't been cultivated. <br>
(Peri carefully picks a flower.) <br>
DOCTOR: For your collection? <br>
PERI: Yeah. When I get back to Earth, I've got to wow the college with
something. My grades certainly won't. It is safe to touch? <br>
DOCTOR: Usually. <br>
(A twig cracks nearby.) <br>
PERI: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Some small rodent? <br>
PERI: With sharp teeth and rabid saliva? <br>
DOCTOR: Not on Necros. At least, not rabies. <br>
(A deformed man snarls in the bushes. Peri screams. The Doctor quickly
give her his cloak and goes forward to meet the man.) <br>
PERI: Careful. <br>
(The Doctor gets out his pocket watch and swings it in front of the
man's eyes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come, my friend. Be at peace with the world. Concentrate.
Concentrate. There we are. Now, what seems to be the problem? <br>
(The man attacks the Doctor, pushing him against a tree.) <br>
PERI: Doctor! <br>
(They continue to wrestle in the snow.) <br>
PERI: Help! Someone help! Just hold on, Doctor! Hold on! <br>
(Whilst the man tries to throttle the Doctor, Peri finds something to
hit him with.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (All this is on one of the nine video screens in
front of the DJ, who lounges in an easy chair and broadcasts through a
head set. Everyone say Hi! to new wave comedian <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0768488/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alexei Sayle</a>,
disguised in Lennon glasses, beads, flowers and long hair. Very hippy,
very sixties.) <br>
DJ: Hey there, you guys, figure this. For those of you who are
appreciative of the humanoid female form, we have a maiden in distress.
Not often we get one of those around here. Usually this place is as
quiet as the grave! But seriously though, guys, a word of warning. </font></p>

contraption with lots of wires in the middle.) <br>
DJ [on screen]: Remember that although I am playing swinging Sixties
sounds, you are in suspended animation. <br>
(A cream and gold Dalek trundles through and looks at the image of the
DJ on the upper wall.) <br>
DJ [on screen]: And we don't want a repeat of last time, now do we?
Remember, over here. <br>
(A head in a jar gives an order.) <br>
DAVROS: Shut the fool up. <br>
DJ [on screen]: Are expensive to replace. <br>
(The image changes to the Doctor examining his former attacker.) <br>
DALEK: It is the Doctor. <br>
DAVROS: Excellent. My lure has worked. <br>
DALEK: I shall order Daleks to detain him. <br>
DAVROS: No! It will give me the greater pleasure to watch his own
curiosity deliver him into my hands. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The young man and woman come to a crossroads.
There is an armed guard ahead. She loads a hand gun.) <br>
GRIGORY: You're such an impetuous child. These things kill. <br>
NATASHA: So do guards. <br>
GRIGORY: Oh, why did I ever allow myself to be talked into this folly? <br>
(He takes a drink from a flask hanging round his neck.) <br>
NATASHA: That stuff won't help you. <br>
GRIGORY: I can but try. Look at the state I'm in. I don't know whether
my hand shakes from fear or the delirium tremens. <br>
NATASHA: Are you ready? <br>
GRIGORY: If you must. <br>
NATASHA: One, two three. <br>
(They mow down the guard.) </font></p>

seven. <br>
DAVROS: Show me. Inform Takis there are body snatchers in the
catacombs. <br>
DALEK: At once. <br>
(Natasha uses instructions on her map to open a pair of doors. They go
through.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Necros]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor cradles his attacker.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why did you attack us? <br>
MUTANT: The disc. You shouldn't have tried to condition me. I would
have reacted similarly had you attacked me. In many ways, I think
you've done me a favour. It's not been much fun being like I am. You
wouldn't think I once looked like you. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened to you? <br>
MUTANT: The Great Healer. I'm a product of his experimentation. <br>
DOCTOR: Who is this Great Healer. <br>
(But the mutant dies.) <br>
PERI: I killed him, and he forgave me. Why did he have to be so nice
about it? <br>
DOCTOR: You had no choice. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Davros' laboratory]</b> </font></p>

building. Natasha and Grigory are nearly caught, but the man turns
around at the last moment.) <br>
DJ: Whoa, heavy. Hey there, you guys, we have you-know-what in the
building. Looks like somebody could be in for a sudden defrosting. But
seriously though, guys, I think it's time to cool down the pace a
little. You know, I think there's nothing more soothing than a
dedication or two. Yeah. <br>
(While Procul Harem play Whiter Shade of Pale, the DJ digs a pile of
screwed up papers from the back of his easy chair.) <br>
DJ: You know, guys, I get as much of a kick out of reading these as I
know you do hearing them. </font></p>

with the corpse.) <br>
TASAMBEKER: Takis? Are you listening to me? <br>
LILT: Who's in love? Who's in love? <br>
TASAMBEKER: Who said that? Was it you? <br>
TAKIS: What? <br>
TASAMBEKER: Oh, never mind. <br>
(Takis comes down the steps holding a blue flower.) <br>
TAKIS: Why do you have to make so much noise? You're giving me a
headache. <br>
TASAMBEKER: I'll give you more than that in a moment. Your communicator
was switched off and the Great Healer has been trying to contact you,
but it seems you prefer to play with flowers than do your duty. <br>
TAKIS: I like flowers. <br>
TASAMBEKER: You're supposed to be head of security. <br>
TAKIS: I can still like flowers. <br>
TASAMBEKER: Not when it compromises your duty. You're a disgrace. <br>
TAKIS: Because I like flowers, or because I won't respond to your
pathetic bullying? Because that's what you are, Tasambeker, a bully. <br>
TASAMBEKER: Your attitude does not go unnoticed. The Great Healer sees
and hears everything. <br>
TAKIS: Then he'll also see how you abuse his name to bolster your own
authority. <br>
TASAMBEKER: That's right, Takis. Keep it up. Talk yourself in front of
a firing squad. <br>
TAKIS: She's threatening me again. <br>
LILT: Well, she is a bit upset. You've got to allow her to get rid of
her frustration somehow. <br>
TASAMBEKER: Shut up! Listen, </i>you're both in enough trouble
as it is. There are bodysnatchers in the building. They must have
walked in right under your noses. <br>
TAKIS: Did you see anyone? <br>
LILT: No. Did you? <br>
TAKIS: No. You see? Must have got in another way. <br>
TASAMBEKER: Enjoy yourselves while you can. Meanwhile, find the
intruders! <br>

like Elvis.) <br>
DJ: Rock and roll! Hi there, casket eight one six, or should I say, hi,
George. This is the DJ with a very special message for you, my friend.
For you, get down, I say, get down. Congratulations. And your dear wife
now, who is still very much alive, would like to send you her fondest
and her sincerest love. Yeah, she still misses you, my man. She misses
you a heck of a lot. She would also like to reassure you on this
special day that her every waking hour is spent administering the
research fund which you set up to find a cure for Beck's Syndrome, that
oh so dreadful disease which took you from her side. And I say get
down, I say, get down. So George, from her heart to your heart,
celebrating your long life it's some good old Fifties Earth time rock
and roll! Yeah, go for it. <br>
(Elvis sings Blue Suede Shoes and the DJ turns off his microphone. His
normal accent is Liverpool, bless him.) <br>
DJ: Well, you've got a wife and a half there, George. She found a cure
for Beck's Syndrome forty years ago. Still, it'd be interesting to know
what she's really doing with the money. <br>
(He calls up the image of the Doctor and Peri in the snow and
broadcasts again.) <br>
DJ: Hey there, guys. Hey there, guys. I said hey, the maiden in
distress is a-coming this way. I wonder which one of you lucky fellows
she's coming to see? <br>

GRIGORY: Why did I let you talk me into this? <br>
NATASHA: Get on with it. <br>
GRIGORY: A bit of tomb robbing is one thing, but did we have to kill
that guard? <br>
NATASHA: Look, I don't want to be here any more than you do, but that's
supposed to be my father in there. I want to know why the courts were
so unwilling to let me have his body back. Now hurry up. <br>
GRIGORY: You can't rush this sort of thing. <br>
NATASHA: Neither can we hang around here. <br>
GRIGORY: Look, if I open that door too soon, the molecular structure of
the body will break down and poor old Stengos will turn into a pool of
high protein water. Even if I were confident I could reconstitute him,
we do not have a suitable vessel into which he could be ladled. Excuse
me. <br>
NATASHA: Hurry up and get on with it. <br>
GRIGORY: Don't you ever listen? I'm a doctor, not a magician. You'll
kill him. <br>
NATASHA: If we don't succeed, he's already dead. Now get the door open.

talking to a head on a holographic screen.) <br>
KARA: It's all very well to make these demands, but you already take
most of the profits my factories make. <br>
DAVROS [on monitor]: I created the product you manufacture. I have a
right to the money. <br>
KARA: I'm well aware of that, Great Healer. I would willingly sell the
bones of Vogel here if it would help your cause. <br>
VOGEL: And I would give them willingly. <br>
KARA: You see how devoted we are. But you'd get very little for him,
dead or alive, and I would be without a secretary. Good secretaries are
very hard to find. <br>
DAVROS [on monitor]: I do not wish to hear any more of your prattling
tongue! Forgive me, I, I want, I need more money. I cannot complete my
researches without it. <br>
KARA: We'll do our best for you. I'm sure Vogel can engage in a little
creative accountancy on your behalf. <br>
VOGEL: I already do, madam. I'm a past master at the double entry. <br>
KARA: Then you must make it triple. You heard what Davros said. He
needs the money. <br>
DAVROS [on monitor]: Do not call me by my name on an open channel! <br>
KARA: I'm so sorry, Great Healer. Such is my enthusiasm for your cause,
my tongue sometimes speaks what my mind would not dare to think.
Please, accept my apologies. <br>

VOGEL: Perhaps you would like one of our engineers to repair it for

ORCINI: I prefer the inconvenience. Constant reminder of my mortality.

KARA: Even with Davros dead, he's not without his followers. And like
the disciples of any fanatic, they will not give up without a struggle.
As you can see, the box has a series of buttons. I will give you a
simple five digit sequence which will activate the transmitter. This
you must do the moment you enter Davros' laboratory. The moment you
strike the final button, a prerecorded signal will be transmitted. I

men split up, forcing Davros to spin round and round to get at them.
Their bullets hit his control chamber. It spins out of control then
goes BANG! There is a scream and Davros' head collapses like a
punctured balloon.) <br>

them.) <br>

that is common about Orcini. Now, show me what you had to do with the

your ship blew up. I thought with you on board. <br>

really you shouldn't have bothered. <br>

to lure you here. <br>

else have you been up to? <br>

A somewhat flippant title, perhaps, but not without foundation. I have
conquered the diseases that brought their victims here. In every way, I
have complied with the wishes of those who came <br>

bomb box on the table near him and nods. The Doctor returns the nod.) <br>

come back as Daleks. <br>

head, then continues to stand in front of Davros.) <br>
DAVROS: All the resting ones I have used were people of status,
ambition. They would understand, especially as I have given them the
opportunity to become masters of the universe! <br>
DOCTOR: With you as their emperor. But what of the lesser intellects?
Or will they be left to rot? <br>
DAVROS: You should know me better than that, Doctor. <br>
(Behind Davros' back, Orcini takes hold of the bomb again.) <br>
DAVROS: I never waste a valuable commodity. The humanoid form makes an
excellent concentrated protein. This part of the galaxy is developing
quickly. Famine was one of its major problems. <br>
DOCTOR: You've turned them into food? <br>
DAVROS: A scheme that has earned me great acclaim. <br>
DOCTOR: But did you bother to tell anyone they might be eating their
own relatives? <br>
DAVROS: Certainly not. That would have created what I believe is termed
consumer resistance. They were grateful for the food. It allowed them
to go on living. <br>
