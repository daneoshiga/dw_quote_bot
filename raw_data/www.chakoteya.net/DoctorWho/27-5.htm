<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor manages to rip off his ID card.) <br>
DOCTOR: Deadly to humans, maybe. <br>
(And pushes it against the collar around the neck of the revealed
Slitheen, enveloping it and Green with the electricity. They don't like
it. <br>
Neither does the one in the Cabinet Office or Jackie's kitchen. The
Doctor, Rose and Harriet Jones make their escapes, but Jackie is still
trapped.)

MICKEY: Jackie! <br>
(He smashes a chair across the back of the Slitheen, grabs Jackie's
hands and pulls her out of the kitchen. He stops in the doorway to take
a photograph of it on his mobile phone.)

finishes getting Asquith into his skin suit.) <br>
GREEN: Where have you been? I called for help. I sounded the alarm.
There was this lightening, this kind of, er, electricity, and they all
collapsed. <br>
(The policemen check the bodies. The Welsh Sergeant speaks.) <br>
PRICE: I think they're all dead. <br>
GREEN: That's what I'm saying. He did it! That man there. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you will find the Prime Minister is an alien in
disguise. That's never going to work, is it? <br>
POLICEMAN 2: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Fair enough. <br>
(The Doctor runs.)

police.) <br>
ASQUITH: Under the jurisdiction of the Emergency Protocols, I authorise
you to execute this man. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, now, yes, you see, er, the thing is, if I was you, if I
was going to execute someone by backing them against the wall, between
you and me, little word of advice. <br>
(Ding! and a door opens behind the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't stand them against the lift! <br>
(He gets in and goes up.)

DOCTOR: Hello! <br>
(He distracts the Slitheen so that Rose and Harriet can get past behind
it, then closes the lift door again.)

quarantine. You will stay where you are. You will disregard all
previous instructions. You will take your orders directly from me. <br>
(The empty lift arrives and Asquith heads for it. Green follows him.) <br>
PRICE: Mister Green, sir. I'm sorry but you've got to come with me. We
should evacuate the entire building. <br>
GREEN: Sergeant, have you read the Emergency Protocols? <br>
PRICE: No, sir. <br>
GREEN: Then don't question me. Seal off Number 10, secure the ground
floor, and if the Doctor makes it downstairs - shoot on sight! <br>
(Green closes the lift doors.) <br>
PRICE: Well, you heard him. Move out!

MARGARET: Oh, such fun. Little human children, where are you? Sweet
little humeykins, come to me. Let me kiss you better. Kiss you with my
big, green lips. <br>
(Rose makes it from the cabinet to behind a curtain.)
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor runs down the staircase and hides as
the lift arrives on this floor. Two naked Slitheen walk out.) <br>
GREEN: It does us good to hunt. Purifies the blood. <br>
ASQUITH: We'll keep this floor quarantined as our last hunting ground
before the final phase. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Sitting room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Slitheens Green and Asquith enter.) <br>
MARGARET: My brothers. <br>
GREEN: Happy hunting? <br>
MARGARET: It's wonderful. The more you prolong it, the more they stink.
<br>
ASQUITH: Sweat and fear. <br>
GREEN: I can smell an old girl. Stale bird and brittle bones. <br>
MARGARET: And a ripe youngster, all hormones and adrenalin. Fresh
enough to bend before she snaps. <br>
(Margaret pulls back the curtain. Rose screams.) <br>
HARRIET: No! Take me first! Take me! <br>
(The Doctor bursts in with a fire extinguisher. He sprays the male
Slitheen with CO2.) <br>
DOCTOR: Out, with me! <br>
(Rose pulls the curtain down over Margaret.) <br>
DOCTOR: Who the hell are you? <br>
HARRIET: Harriet Jones, MP for Flydale North. <br>
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you. <br>
HARRIET: Likewise. <br>
(The Doctor uses up the CO2 and they run out.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Corridor]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: We need to head to the Cabinet Room. <br>
HARRIET: The Emergency Protocols are in there. They give instructions
for aliens. <br>
DOCTOR: Harriet Jones, I like you. <br>
HARRIET: And I like you too. <br>
(The Slitheen chase our heroes through corridors and rooms.)
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor grabs a decanter from a side table and
stands in the doorway.) <br>
DOCTOR: One more move and my sonic device will triplicate the
flammability of this alcohol. Whoof, we all go up. So back off. <br>
(The Slitheen take one step back in the outer office.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right then. Question time. Who exactly are the Slitheen? <br>
HARRIET: They're aliens. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I got that, thanks. <br>
GREEN: Who are you, if not human? <br>
HARRIET: Who's not human? <br>
ROSE: He's not human. <br>
HARRIET: He's not human? <br>
DOCTOR: Can I have a bit of hush? <br>
HARRIET: Sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: So, what's the plan? <br>
HARRIET: But he's got a Northern accent. <br>
ROSE: Lots of planets have a north. <br>
DOCTOR: I said hush. Come on. You've got a spaceship hidden in the
North Sea. It's transmitting a signal. You've murdered your way to the
top of government. What for, invasion? <br>
ASQUITH: Why would we invade this God-forsaken rock? <br>
DOCTOR: Then something's brought the Slitheen race here. What is it? <br>
ASQUITH: The Slitheen race? <br>
GREEN: Slitheen is not our species. Slitheen is our surname. Jocrassa
Fel Fotch Pasameer-Day-Slitheen at your service. <br>
DOCTOR: So, you're family. <br>
GREEN: A family business. <br>
DOCTOR: Then you're out to make a profit. How can you do that on a
God-forsaken rock? <br>
ASQUITH: Ah, excuse me? Your device will do what? Triplicate the
flammability? <br>
DOCTOR: Is that what I said? <br>
ASQUITH: You're making it up. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well! Nice try. Harriet, have a drink. I think you're gonna
need it. <br>
(Harriet is clutching the Red Box.) <br>
HARRIET: You pass it to the left first. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. <br>
ROSE: Thanks. <br>
ASQUITH: Now we can end this hunt with a slaughter. <br>
ROSE: Don't you think we should run? <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating history, Downing Street. Two thousand years ago,
this was marsh land. 1730, it was occupied by a Mister Chicken. He was
a nice man. 1796, this was the Cabinet Room. If the Cabinet's in
session and in danger, these are about the four most safest walls in
the whole of Great Britain. End of lesson. <br>
(The Doctor lifts a small panel by the door and presses a button. Metal
shutters crash shut across the windows and doors.) <br>
DOCTOR: Installed in 1991. Three inches of steel lining every single
wall. They'll never get in. <br>
ROSE: And how do we get out? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outer office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GREEN: He's safely contained. Now, cut off
communications inside that room, then summon the family. It's time we
finished with this insane planet for good.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ANDREW MARR: And there's still no word from inside
Downing Street, though we are getting even more new arrivals. That's
group Captain Tennant James of the RAF, though why he's been summoned
we've no idea. And that's Ewan McAllister, Deputy Secretary for the
Scottish Parliament. And this is most unusual. I'm told that is Sylvia
Dillane, Chairman of the North Sea Boating Club. Quite what connects
these people, we have no idea. <br>
(Apart from being larger than the average person.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The three Slitheen are back in their body suits.) <br>
MARGARET: Group Captain. Delighted you could make it. We're meeting
upstairs. (Fart!) That's the spirit. Off you go. Good to see you. Come
on through.&nbsp;<br>
ASQUITH: Ah, Sergeant. Now that the Doctor's been neutralised, the
upper levels are out of bounds to everyone. <br>
SERGEANT: Then who are they? <br>
ASQUITH: Need to know, Sergeant. Need to know. I want you to liaise
with Communications. The acting Prime Minister will be making a public
address. He will speak to the nations of the world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sylvia goes into the blue lit toilets, while
Margaret gets a coat hanger from a rack.) <br>
MARGARET: There you are. If you'd just like to go through and get
changed. <br>
(She takes a skin suit off an emerging Slitheen, who used to be Group
Captain James.) <br>
MARGARET: Now, if you'd like to head down to the end of the corridor,
it's first on the left. <br>
JAMES: Thank you. </font></p>

MICKEY: No chance. I've seen you when you've had a few. This ain't time
for a conga. <br>
JACKIE: We've got to tell someone. <br>
MICKEY: Who do we trust? For all we know, they've all got big bog
monsters inside of them. I mean, this is what he does, Jacks, that
Doctor bloke. Everywhere he goes, death and destruction, and he's got
Rose in the middle of it. <br>
JACKIE: Has he got a great big green thing inside him, then? <br>
MICKEY: I wouldn't put it past him. But like it or not, he's the only
person who knows how to fight these things. <br>
JACKIE: I thought I was going to die. <br>
(Jackie starts crying. Mickey gives her a quick, awkward hug.) <br>
MICKEY: Come on, yeah? If anyone's going to cry, it's going to be me.
Now, you're safe in my flat, Jacks. No one's
going To look for you here, especially since you hate me so much. <br>
JACKIE: You saved my life. God, that's embarrassing. <br>
MICKEY: You're telling me. <br>
JACKIE: He wanted me dead. And he's still out there, Mickey. That
policeman. That thing.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor drags Ganesh's body into a small store
room, where the late Anthony Blair is also laid out.) <br>
DOCTOR: What was his name? <br>
HARRIET: Who? <br>
DOCTOR: This one. The secretary or whatever he was called. <br>
HARRIET: I don't know. I talked to him. I brought him a cup of coffee.
I never asked his name. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. Right, what have we got? Any terminals, anything? <br>
ROSE: No. This place is antique. What I don't get is, when they killed
the Prime Minister, why didn't they use him as a disguise? <br>
DOCTOR: He's too slim. They're big old beasts. They need to fit inside
big humans. <br>
ROSE: But the Slitheen are about eight feet. How do they fit inside? <br>
DOCTOR: That's the device around their necks. Compression field.
Literally shrinks them down a bit. That's why there's all that gas.
It's a big exchange. <br>
ROSE: Wish I had a compression field. I could fit a size smaller. <br>
HARRIET: Excuse me, people are dead! This is not the time for making
jokes. <br>
ROSE: Sorry. You get used to this stuff when you're friends with him. <br>
HARRIET: Well, that's a strange friendship. <br>
DOCTOR: Harriet Jones. I've heard that name before. Harriet Jones.
You're not famous for anything, are you? <br>
HARRIET: Oh, hardly. <br>
DOCTOR: Rings a bell. Harriet Jones? <br>
HARRIET: Lifelong backbencher I'm afraid, and a fat lot of use I'm
being now. The Protocols are redundant. They list
the people who could help and they're all dead downstairs. <br>
ROSE: Hasn't it got, like, defence codes and things? Couldn't we just
launch a nuclear bomb at them? <br>
HARRIET: You're a very violent young woman. <br>
ROSE: I'm serious. We could. <br>
HARRIET: Well, there's nothing like that in here. Nuclear strikes do
need a release code, yes, but it's kept secret by the United Nations. <br>
DOCTOR: Say that again. <br>
HARRIET: What, about the codes? <br>
DOCTOR: Anything. All of it. <br>
HARRIET: Well, the British Isles can't gain access to atomic weapons
without a Special Resolution from the UN. <br>
ROSE: Like that's ever stopped them. <br>
HARRIET: Exactly, given our past record. And I voted against that,
thank you very much. The codes have been taken out of the government's
hands and given to the UN. Is it important? <br>
DOCTOR: Everything's important. <br>
HARRIET: If we only knew what the Slitheen wanted. Listen to me. I'm
saying Slitheen as if it's normal.<br>
ROSE: What do they want, though? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they're just one family, so it's not an invasion. They
don't want Slitheen World They're out to make money. That means they
want to use something. Something here on Earth. Some kind of asset. <br>
HARRIET: Like what, gold? Oil? Water? <br>
DOCTOR: You're very good at this. <br>
HARRIET: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Harriet Jones. Why do I know that name? <br>
(Phone beep) <br>
ROSE: Oh, that's me. <br>
HARRIET: But we're sealed off. How did you get a signal? <br>
ROSE: He zapped it. Super phone. <br>

HARRIET: Harriet Jones. MP, Flydale North. I want you to contact UN
immediately. Tell the ambassadors the crisis is over. They can step
down. Go on, tell the news. <br>
PRiCE: Yes, ma'am. <br>
HARRIET: Someone's got a hell of a job sorting this lot out. Oh, Lord.
We haven't even got a Prime Minister. <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe you should have a go. <br>
HARRIET: Me? Huh. I'm only a back-bencher. <br>
ROSE: I'd vote for you. <br>
HARRIET: Now, don't be silly. Look, I'd better go and see if I can

JACKIE: Harriet Jones. Who does she think she is? Look at her, taking
all the credit. Should be you on there. My daughter saved the world! <br>
ROSE: I think the Doctor helped a bit. <br>
JACKIE: All right, then. Him too. You should be given knighthoods. <br>
ROSE: That's not the way he does things. No fuss. He just moves on.
He's not that bad if you gave him a chance. <br>
JACKIE: He's good in a crisis, I'll give him that. <br>
ROSE: Oh, now the world has changed. You're saying nice things about
him. <br>
JACKIE: Well, I reckon I've got no choice. There's no getting rid of
him since you're infatuated. <br>
ROSE: I'm not infatuated. <br>
JACKIE: What does he eat? <br>
ROSE: How do you mean? <br>
JACKIE: I was going to do shepherds pie. All of us. A proper sit down,
'cos I'm ready to listen. I wanna learn about you and him and that life
you lead. Only, I don't know, he's an alien. For all I know, he eats
grass and safety pins and things. <br>
ROSE: He'll have shepherd pie. You're going to cook for him? <br>
JACKIE: What's wrong with that? <br>
ROSE: He's finally met his match. <br>
JACKIE: You're not too old for a slap, you know. You can go and visit
your Gran tomorrow. You'd better learn some French. I told her you were
in France. I said you were au-pairing. <br>

the whole world's changed. Aliens and spaceships all in public. And
here it is. <br>
(The Evening Standard headline is - Alien Hoax.) <br>
MICKEY: How could they do that? They saw it. <br>

that's invisible, but if it's staring you in the face, nope, can't see
it. There's a scientific explanation for that. You're thick. <br>

and if Jim comes round again, I'll say no. I really will. <br>

something happens to you, Doctor, and she's left all alone standing on
some moon a million light years away. How long do I wait then? <br>
ROSE: Mum, you're forgetting. It's a time machine. I could go
travelling around suns and planets and all the way out to the edge of
the universe, and by the time I get back, yeah, ten seconds would have
passed. Just ten seconds. So stop worrying. See you in ten seconds'
time, yeah? <br>
