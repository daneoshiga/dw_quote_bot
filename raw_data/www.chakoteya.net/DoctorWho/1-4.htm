SUSAN: Must've been made by a giant. What do you make of this?<br>
IAN: Well, it could be a perfectly ordinary footprint, Susan, and the
sun's melted the edges and made it look a bit bigger.<br>
SUSAN: Oh.<br>
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis)<br>
IAN: You all right, Doctor?<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, a little bit out of breath. Oh, that's quite
understandable. After all, we're several thousand feet above sea level.<br>
SUSAN: Do you know where we are then, Grandfather?<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I directed the ship towards Earth and it looks as though
I've been successful.<br>
SUSAN: But what about that? (the footprint) <br>
DOCTOR: That? Oh, I can't see anything without my glasses. Anyway, I
don't like this place. You'll have to excuse me. I've got a lot of work
to do first. <br>
(The Doctor goes back into the Tardis.)<br>
IAN: Barbara, I wonder, do you think it could be the Earth? If it were,
where do you think we could be? In the Alps?<br>
BARBARA: Or it could be the Andes. <br>
SUSAN: Himalayas, the roof of the world.<br>
IAN: The roof of the world. I wonder. If only. Well, the Doctor isn't
very reliable, you know. Mustn't count on
anything.<br>
(The Doctor comes out of the Tardis again.)<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear. We're always in trouble, Isn't this
extraordinary? It follows us everywhere.<br>
IAN: What's the matter?<br>
DOCTOR: All the lights in the ship have gone out. The whole circuit has
burned itself to a cinder, and added to that it affected the water. We
haven't got any.<br>
IAN: Well, the water's no bother, Doctor. I mean, we've got snow,
plenty of it. But how about the heating?<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the heating as well. Everything's gone to pot.<br>
BARBARA: But that's serious. We could freeze to death.<br>
DOCTOR: Serious. Are you telling? There's no need for you to tell me
that, really.<br>
IAN: I think I'd better try and find some fuel.<br>
DOCTOR: Fuel? Now where on earth do you expect to find fuel here, hmm?<br>
IAN: Well, I must try, mustn't I?<br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, I wish you luck.<br>
BARBARA: I'll come with you, Ian.<br>
IAN: Thank you.<br>
SUSAN: Yes, me too.<br>
IAN: No, Susan, you stay here.<br>
DOCTOR: You stay with me, child. You might be able to help me.<br>
SUSAN: Okay.<br>
IAN: Oh, come on, Barbara, we haven't much time.<br>
DOCTOR: Now, Susan, go into the ship and fetch me the two L oh, will
you? You know what it is. Even if I do find the fault, I don't suppose
I shall be able to repair it before it gets dark, and then we shall all
freeze to death.

BARBARA: Doctor, there are strange things on the mountain. I saw one of
them.<br>
DOCTOR: What's she talking about now?<br>
IAN: Well, I only saw a print.<br>
DOCTOR: Print? What sort of print? Paws, hooves, what?<br>
IAN: To tell you the truth, I thought it was made by a fur boot.<br>
BARBARA: No, Ian, I'm sure it wasn't human.<br>
DOCTOR: And if it were, that means there's shelter nearby.<br>

SUSAN: Grandfather!<br>
IAN: Keep still. We're travellers, lost on the mountains. Will you give
us shelter?<br>
TEGANA: Hear me, Mongols. In these parts live evil spirits, who take
our likeness to deceive us and then lead us to our deaths. Let us
therefore destroy these evil spirits before they destroy us.<br>
IAN: We're not evil spirits. We are people like yourselves.<br>
TEGANA: Destroy them.<br>
POLO: Stop! Put up your swords.<br>
TEGANA: Would you have us killed? These are evil spirits. <br>

SUSAN: He's not like her, or any of the others.<br>
BARBARA: No, he's a European, Susan, and he mentioned Kublai Khan. <br>
SUSAN: Kublai Khan?<br>
BARBARA: He was a great Mongol leader, who conquered all of Asia. He
had a European in his service. He was a Venetian and his name <br>
POLO: I'm afraid the liquid is not too warm, but the cold here is so
intense, it even robs a flame of its heat.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's excellent nourishment, sir.<br>
IAN: The cold can't affect the heat of the flame, sir. The liquid boils
at a lower temperature, because there's so little air up here.<br>
POLO: You mean the air is responsible?<br>
IAN: Well, the lack of it. Just as the lack of it is responsible for
the Doctor's mountain sickness.<br>
BARBARA: Is your name Marco Polo?<br>
POLO: It is, my lady, and may I ask who you are?<br>
DOCTOR: Oh we're travellers yes. That's my grandchild, Susan, and
that's Miss Wright, and that's Charlton.<br>
IAN: Chesterton. Ian Chesterton. <br>
POLO: My companions are the Lady Ping-Cho and the Warlord Tegana. We
travel to Shang Tu.<br>
BARBARA: Shang Tu? That's in China, isn't it?<br>
POLO: China? I do not know this place. Shang Tu is in Cathay.<br>
BARBARA: Oh, silly of me. Yes, of course, Cathay.<br>

mountainside at night, but questions can wait until morning.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there were two, young man, that I would like to ask.<br>
POLO: Well, ask them.<br>
DOCTOR: What year is this and where are we, hmm?<br>
POLO: You do not know?<br>
DOCTOR: That is why I'm asking you.<br>
POLO: How long have you been travelling? It is twelve hundred and
eighty nine and this is the Plain of Pamir, known to those who travel
to Cathay as The Roof of the World.<br>

SUSAN: No.<br>
PING-CHO: Where are you from?<br>
SUSAN: That's a very difficult question to answer, Ping-Cho.<br>
PING-CHO: You do not know where your home is?<br>
SUSAN: Well, I've had many homes in many places. What about you?<br>
PING-CHO: I come from Samarkand. My father is government official there.<br>
SUSAN: But I thought Mister Polo said that <br>
PING-CHO: Messer Marco! That's what we call him in Cathay. <br>
SUSAN: Well, I thought Messer Marco said that you were going to Shang
Tu. Are you on holiday?<br>
PING-CHO: No, Kublai Khan's summer palace is in Shang Tu. I am going
there to be married.<br>
SUSAN: What? But how old are you?<br>
PING-CHO: I am in my sixteenth year.<br>
SUSAN: Well, so am I.<br>
PING-CHO: Do you marry at our age in your land? Here it is the custom.<br>
SUSAN: Is your fiancé handsome?<br>
PING-CHO: My what?<br>
SUSAN: Your, the man you're going to marry.<br>
PING-CHO: I have never seen him.<br>
SUSAN: What?<br>
PING-CHO: The marriage has been arranged by my family. I know only two
things about him.<br>

PING-CHO: He is very important man. <br>
SUSAN: That's a good start.<br>

POLO: Why? Because their clothes are different from ours? Because their
words are unfamiliar to our ears? No, Tegana, they are travellers.<br>
TEGANA: They are evil spirits. Sorcerers. Magicians. Tomorrow, if we
live until then, you may see that I speak the truth.<br>
POLO: I think the sun's rays will dispel the shadows from your mind,
Tegana.<br>
TEGANA: Is that what you believe. Listen, the carriage they travel in
has no wheels. It just stands there like a warlord's tomb on one end.
And another thing. It is not large enough to carry four people.<br>
POLO: It must be.<br>

sword, I swear it to you.

IAN: Through the air.<br>
TEGANA: Did I not say they that they were evil spirits?<br>
POLO: Are you of the Buddhist faith?<br>
IAN: No, why?<br>
POLO: Well, at the Khan's court in Peking, I have seen Buddhist monks
make cups of wine fly through the air unaided and offer themselves to
the Great Khan's lips. I do not understand it, but I have seen it.
There is room for all of you inside here, Miss Wright?<br>
BARBARA: Yes.<br>
POLO: And one enters here?<br>
BARBARA: It's locked.<br>
POLO: Where is the key?<br>
BARBARA: The Doctor has it, and you wouldn't let him come up here.<br>
POLO: Oh yes, he has the mountain sickness. Have you the power to make
it fly?<br>
IAN: No, only the Doctor has that power.<br>
POLO: Why is it here?<br>
SUSAN: It's damaged.<br>
POLO: What?<br>
IAN: Part of it is broken.<br>
POLO: But it could be moved by hand?<br>

shall see.

enters.)&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Ping-Cho, this smells very, very good! What is it?<br>
PING-CHO: Bean-sprout soup, my lord.<br>
DOCTOR: Allow me. (he tastes it) Oh, it's delicious, delicious.<br>
PING-CHO: My lord is kind.<br>
DOCTOR: You know, it's rather surprising to find the daughter of a high
government official working as a servant in Marco Polo's caravan.<br>
PING-CHO: I wish to serve, my lord, although, among Messer Marco's
retinue, there is a man who calls himself a cook.<br>
DOCTOR: His name wouldn't be Tegana, would it?<br>
PING-CHO: Oh no, my lord. The Warlord Tegana is a special emissary from
the camp of the great Mongol Lord Khan Noghai, who has been at war with
Kublai Khan.<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Mongol fighting Mongol. <br>
PING-CHO: The war is over, my lord. Noghai has sued for peace and
Tegana travels to Kublai's court to discuss the armistice plans. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, oh well, yes. Well, for an emissary of peace, he has
rather blood-thirsty habits, doesn't he?<br>
(Marco Polo, Ian, Barbara and Susan enter.)<br>
POLO: I find your caravan most unusual, Doctor.<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Messer Marco, it is different.<br>
POLO: And in need of repair?<br>
DOCTOR: That is true.<br>
SUSAN: Messer Marco has ordered a sledge to be made. He's going to
bring the Tardis down here.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh indeed? That's charming of you. Very charming of you. It
won't take me very long to repair. A day or two. But I assure you that
I shall not hold up your journey any longer than is necessary.<br>
POLO: I'm afraid we can't stay here. One crosses the Plain of Pamir as
quickly as possible. However, we will be spending a few days at Lop.<br>
BARBARA: Lop? Where's that?<br>
POLO: It's a town on the edge of the Gobi Desert, beyond Kashgar and
Yarkand.<br>
DOCTOR: I see, and you will be taking us along with you, including the
Tardis?<br>
POLO: Doctor, I once transported an entire army and its equipment from
Cathay to India, all without loss.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh good, good. Then I can work as we proceed.<br>
POLO: No.<br>
DOCTOR: Why not, hmm?<br>
POLO: The Mongol bearers still half believe that you are evil spirits.
They also believe that outside your caravan, you are harmless. However,
should any of you attempt to enter, there would be trouble.<br>
DOCTOR: I see. You saved our lives, Messer Marco and the least we can
do is to respect your wishes. No one will enter the Tardis until we
reach Lop.<br>
POLO: Good.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POLO [OC]: Success. My plan has worked. The
strangers and their unusual caravan accompany me to Lop. Our route
takes us across the Roof of the World, down to the Kashgar Valley and
southeast to Tarkand. Here we join the Old Silk Road, along which the
commerce and culture of a thousand years has travelled to and from
Cathay. I wonder what the strangers' reaction will be when I tell them
what I propose to do?

plenty of food and water before venturing out into the Gobi Desert. <br>

POLO: Is the accommodation to your liking, Ping-Cho?<br>
PING-CHO: Thank you, Messer Marco. It is most comfortable.<br>
SUSAN: Oh, I think it's fab.<br>
PING-CHO: Fab? What is that, Susan?<br>
SUSAN: Well, it's, it means wonderful! It's a verb we often use on
Earth.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Messer Marco, these way-stations, do you have many of these
in Cathay?<br>
POLO: Yes, the Khan has them dotted at regular intervals throughout his
domain. Those who work in his service and wear the Khan's gold seal
have the right to demand anything they may require. Provisions, horses,
shelter.<br>

work to do and <br>

soldiers. He goes back inside) <br>

DOCTOR: I don't wish to sit down. I want you to call your guards off.<br>
POLO: Please be seated.<br>
DOCTOR: No.<br>
POLO: I beg you to hear me out.<br>
DOCTOR: But I have work to do.<br>
BARBARA: I think, perhaps, we should listen to him. Come on.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, very well. <br>
POLO: My home is Venice. I left there with my father and my uncle to
come to Cathay in twelve seventy one. The journey to Peking took us
three and a half years. When I arrived at the Khan's court, I was
twenty one. I was an alert young man, good at languages, and willing to
learn. The Khan liked me.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, really?<br>
POLO: On my twenty fifth birthday, I was given an appointment in the
Khan's service.<br>
BARBARA: Twelve seventy seven.<br>
POLO: It was, as you say, twelve seventy seven. Since then, I have
travelled to every corner of his domain and beyond it. Two years ago,
my father, my uncle and I asked the Khan for permission to go home. He
refused. I think we had all served him too well.<br>
DOCTOR: Well, I really don't see what this has to do with my repairing
the Tardis. <br>
POLO: Doctor, I have not seen my home for eighteen years. I want to go
back.<br>
DOCTOR: Well, ask the Khan again.<br>
POLO: I intend to. This time, I shall offer him a gift so magnificent
that he will not be able to refuse me.<br>
IAN: You mean to give the Doctor's caravan to him?<br>
POLO: Yes.<br>
DOCTOR: You're mad.<br>
POLO: You can make another.<br>
DOCTOR: What? In Peking, or Shang Tu?<br>
POLO: You do me an injustice, Doctor. I will not leave you stranded in
Cathay, just as I did not let you die on the mountain. No, you will
come with me to Venice and make another one there.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you think so, really? Oh no. Oh no.<br>
IAN: Marco, it's impossible.<br>
POLO: Surely, for a man who possesses a flying caravan, all things are
possible?<br>
IAN: No. We need special metals, materials, things that don't exist in
Venice. I'm afraid you don't understand all the problems involved.<br>
DOCTOR: And neither do you, young man. <br>
POLO: Well, travel home by ship. We trade with every port in the world.
It may take you longer, but you'll get there eventually. <br>
DOCTOR: Eventually. He doesn't know what he's talking about. The man's
a lunatic. Ho. <br>
POLO: No, Doctor, desperate. There are many men who are jealous of the
Polo influence at court, and the Khan suffers from an affliction for
which there is no cure.<br>
BARBARA: What's that?<br>
POLO: Old age. If he dies, I may never see Venice again.<br>
DOCTOR: Well, that is your problem, not mine. <br>
POLO: I have just made it yours, Doctor. <br>
BARBARA: But you do see Venice again, Marco, I know you do. <br>
IAN: What makes you so sure that the Doctor's caravan is a suitable
present? The Doctor is the only one who can fly it. <br>
POLO: I told you about the Buddhist monks. They will discover its
secret. A caravan that flies. Do you imagine what this will mean to the
Khan? It will make him the most powerful ruler the world has ever
known. Stronger than Hannibal. Mightier than Alexander the Great. <br>
IAN: Marco, you don't understand. <br>
POLO: I refuse to listen you to any more. My mind is made up. Your
caravan goes with me to Kublai Khan. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, come on. Come and sit down.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, what a mess.<br>
SUSAN: Grandfather. Grandfather.<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Go by sea, he says. <br>

unusual caravan, and set out into the Gobi Desert. The journey across
this vast ocean of sand is slow and hazardous. To make matters worse,

we have covered no more than thirty miles, I have had to endure his

Desert, Marco? <br>

eight gourds to carry us across to the other side. <br>

in the desert sand. <br>

balanced armies deployed upon a field of battle, and each commander
determined to be the one who cries shah mat. <br>

PING-CHO: I am ready, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, good. <br>
PING-CHO: Gracious maidens, gentle lords, pray attend me while I tell
my tale of Ala-eddin, the Old Man of the Mountains, who by devious
schemes, evil designs and foul murders ruled the land. <br>
No host of arms, no vast array of banners served this wicked lord. They
were but few, ruthless, reckless men who obeyed his cruel commands. <br>
Thus did he persuade them. <br>
Promising paradise, he gave his followers a potent draught and whilst
they slept transported them to a vale where streams of milk and honey,
wine and water, flowed. <br>
Here were gardens and flowers of every hue and essence. Here, too
Golden pavilions outshone the sun and even the stars of heaven envied
the bejewelled interiors strewn with incomparable silks, tapestries,
and treasures. <br>
Hand-maidens, dulcet-voiced, soft of face, attended them, and thus
bemused did they dwell in this man-made paradise until Ala-eddin intent
upon some evil deed, proffered again the hashish draught and brought
them sleeping to his castle. <br>
What lord, are we cast out of paradise? Awakening, they cried. <br>
Not so. Go abroad, seek out my enemies and strike them down. But care
not for your lives. Paradise is eternal. <br>
So terror stalked the land for many years. Then one day, came mighty
Hulagu to stand before Ala-eddin's lair for three long years in siege.
Thus fell Ala-eddin and his men. <br>
Now honest hands reap harvests of life From the soil where death and
evil reigned. And those who journey through the vale are heard to say
'tis truly paradise today. <br>
(a well deserved round of applause.) <br>
(Barbara follows Tegana leaving the room) <br>
DOCTOR: That was really delightful, Ping-Cho. <br>
PING-CHO: My lord is kind. <br>
POLO: Thank you, Ping-Cho. <br>
IAN: Charming, Ping-Cho, charming. Susan, do you know that we use the
word Hashashin in English today? <br>
SUSAN: No. <br>
IAN: Yes. Assassins. <br>
SUSAN: Assassin! <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
SUSAN: Ping-Cho, is the lair of Ala-eddin near here? <br>
PING-CHO: No, Susan. It was on a mountain called Mount Alumet in
Persia. <br>
SUSAN: Persia? But Messer Marco said that Hulagu killed the Hashashins
near here. <br>
POLO: So he did, Susan. Some of Ala-eddin's followers lived near here,
in the cave of Five Hundred Eyes.

tables on Tegana. Now, go quickly. <br>

IAN: Ah, Marco, I was just coming to have a word with you. <br>
POLO: What about? <br>
IAN: Well, I should have thought that was pretty obvious. <br>
POLO: Be more explicit, Ian. <br>
IAN: Oh, come on Marco, we're friends aren't we? <br>
POLO: We were. <br>
IAN: Well, why the sudden change? And tell me, why separate Susan and
Ping-Cho? <br>
POLO: Susan's a bad influence. <br>
IAN: Oh, you can't really mean that. <br>
POLO: Ping-Cho's first loyalty is to me, yet she backed you against
Tegana. <br>
IAN: Perhaps that's because we were telling the truth. It is possible,
you know. <br>
POLO: Let me tell you something, Ian. Tegana is a special emissary of
Noghai, on his way to talk peace with Kublai Khan. He's a very
important man. You are mysterious travellers from some far off land I
know nothing about. Now, if you were in my position, a servant of
Kublai Khan, whose word would you take? <br>
IAN: Well, I should keep an open mind. <br>
(Tegana enters.) <br>
TEGANA: Marco, I have something rather interesting to show you. <br>
POLO: What is it? <br>
TEGANA: The old magician is in his caravan. <br>
POLO: He's what? Is this true, Ian? <br>
IAN: Well, why don't we go outside and have a look?

IAN: If it'll convince you that Tegana is making trouble, we can wait
here all night. <br>

in there. <br>

IAN: Doctor, lock the door quickly! <br>
POLO: I'm sorry I doubted your word, Tegana. Give me the key, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>

TEGANA: Did I not say he had another key? <br>
DOCTOR: Put that key in the lock, Polo, and you will destroy the ship.
Then where will your precious Khan be, hmmm? You need more than a key
to enter my ship. You need knowledge. Knowledge you will never possess.

at dawn, and by dusk had covered forty miles. As this is a densely
populated area of Cathay, accommodation is not hard to find, and we
have stopped for the night at an inn. Our baggage, including the

POLO: Well? <br>
IAN: Marco, you must give us back the Tardis. <br>
POLO: Is that what you want to talk to me about? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
POLO: Look, I've told you before, Ian. You know what this caravan means
to me. If I give it to the Khan, he'll let me go home. <br>
IAN: But we want to go home too, Marco. And we can't go home without
the Tardis. <br>
POLO: I have offered to take you back to Venice with me, and see you
safely on your way home from there. <br>
IAN: By boat. We can't go by boat, Marco, we need the Tardis. <br>
POLO: Why, Ian? Why? <br>
IAN: All right, I'll tell you why. And I'll tell you the truth. I don't
suppose you'll believe it, but still. As I told you, I come from
England. Barbara as well. <br>
POLO: Well, I grant you England's a long way, but the journey's not
impossible, Ian. The Crusaders did it. <br>
IAN: The Crusaders? Oh, Marco. To me, the Crusaders lived seven hundred
years ago. <br>
POLO: What are you talking about, Ian? The Crusaders were in the Holy
Land twenty five years ago. <br>
IAN: I come from another time. Our caravan, it not only covers
distance, it can cross time. <br>
POLO: Travel into the past and the future? <br>
IAN: Yes. I know it's difficult to believe, but it's the truth. <br>
POLO: On my travels to Cathay, Ian, I have come to believe many things
which I previously doubted. For instance, when I was a boy in Venice,
they told me that in Cathay there was a stone which burned. I did not
believe them, but there is such a stone. I have seen it. <br>
IAN: It's black, isn't it. <br>
POLO: Yes. <br>
IAN: Coal. <br>
POLO: In Cathay, we call it the burning stone. And if a stone burns,
why not a caravan that flies? Birds fly. I have even seen fish that
fly. You are asking me to believe that your caravan can defy the
passage of the sun? Move not merely from one place to another, but from
today into tomorrow, today into yesterday? No, Ian. That I cannot
accept. <br>
IAN: I'm telling you the truth, Marco. <br>
POLO: Are you, Ian? <br>
IAN: I swear it. <br>
POLO: (holding out the Tardis key) Where did you get that? <br>
IAN: From your room. <br>
POLO: Whereabouts? Where had I hidden it? Come, Ian, surely you know
where you found it? You didn't find it, did you? It was given to you,
and you lied about finding it to protect Ping-Cho. Ian, don't you see
it doesn't matter to me why you lied. What is important is the fact
that you are capable of lying. <br>
IAN: So you don't believe me when I say I came from another time. <br>
POLO: If I did Ian, I would give you the key.

readily, so, so eagerly to go back after Ping-Cho? <br>
POLO: What's your point? <br>
TEGANA: Ping-Cho could be anywhere. The chances of finding her are very
small. But, Ian knows where the caravan is. He knows exactly where it
is. <br>
POLO: You're wrong, Tegana. I think I know something of Ian's
character. <br>
TEGANA: You can't know it all. Marco, just give me a strong horse. Now,
by using your name, I can bring them both back to you. I can bring the

Because when peace is concluded with Kublai Khan, he might very well
exchange this magician's caravan for your return to Venice.&nbsp;<br>

DOCTOR: Please. <br>
KHAN: Oh, that is our reckoning? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes it is, sire, yes. <br>
KHAN: What do we owe? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, thirty-five elephants with ceremonial bridles, trappings,
brocades and pavilions. Four thousand white stallions, and twenty-five
tigers. <br>
KHAN: That's not too bad, so far. <br>
DOCTOR: And the sacred tooth of Buddha which Polo brought over from
India. <br>
KHAN: Oh, that? What else? What more? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm very much afraid all the commerce from Burma for one year,
sire. <br>

KHAN: Oh, the Empress. Hide it, hide it! <br>
EMPRESS: Winning, my love? <br>

EMPRESS: You're not wagering are you? You know how it affects your
gout. <br>

DOCTOR: How charming. <br>
KHAN: Charming indeed, and yet there are moments, old friend, when we
wish our character were more like that of our lamented grandfather,
Genghis. Did you hear of him? <br>
DOCTOR: Genghis Khan? No, I didn't meet him, but I have heard of him.
Yes. <br>
KHAN: Oh, he was the warrior of the family. Nothing frightened him. We
are the clan of the statistician and the administrator. Oh, she will be
furious with me when she finds out what I have lost. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, then you've lost nothing, sire. <br>
KHAN: No, no, no. These are bets of honour. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, one more game then, and if you win, you can take it all
back again. <br>
KHAN: And if you win? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, er, Marco Polo has taken away my caravan and given it to
you, sire. If I win, perhaps I could have my caravan back again? <br>
KHAN: No, not that. No, take something else. The Island of Sumatra. We
can't give you Marco's gift. We haven't even seen it yet. <br>
DOCTOR: But none of this is important to me, sire. You see, win or
lose, you can have it all back again. But if I win, my ship, Tardis,
comes back to me, hmm? <br>
KHAN: Let's play at that stake. (a knock at the door) Oh, go away! <br>
POLO [OC]: It's Marco Polo, my Lord. <br>
KHAN: Oh, Marco Polo. Well, would you object to one interruption? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. <br>
KHAN: Enter. <br>
(Polo enters and kow-tows) <br>
KHAN: We are too busy for that, Marco. Be brief, please. Be brief. <br>
POLO: As my lord commands. The War Lord Tegana has arrived in Peking.
When he reaches the palace, shall I bring him directly to you? <br>
KHAN: No. No, we'll grant him an audience as soon as possible. Oh, we
want to tell you something, Marco. We owe half of Asia to our friend at
backgammon. <br>
POLO: It is unusual for you to lose, my Lord. <br>
KHAN: Oh, he is a fortunate one. But our friend here made a truly royal
gesture which we have accepted, although it might upset you. <br>
POLO: Why should it do that? <br>
KHAN: That's our last game. Our losses against your gift to me. <br>
POLO: The caravan? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Marco. We're playing for the Tardis. <br>

TEGANA: Good fortune gave me the opportunity of serving the great Khan.
<br>
KHAN: The lady Ping-Cho has been excused of complicity in the theft. <br>
TEGANA: The Khan shows much wisdom and compassion. What crimes she
committed were done under the influence of others. <br>
KHAN: Crimes? Who else was there? <br>
TEGANA: The old magician, my lord, tried several times to regain the

TEGANA: Is that not natural, my lord, that he would wish to guard them?
<br>
KHAN: You have served us well. <br>
TEGANA: In dealings with Mongols like ourselves, yes, my lord. But he
is as they are. And does not one's loyalty first lie with one's own
kind? <br>

KHAN: Marco, thank you for our gift. <br>
POLO: I am the Khan's obedient servant. <br>
KHAN: We are glad to know. But then, there were other attempts to steal
the caravan? Why did you not invoke our laws? <br>
POLO: To have done so would have been unjust, my lord. Our laws are
alien to them. <br>
KHAN: They were on our soil, therefore, subject to our laws. Why did
you not invoke them? <br>
POLO: The caravan belonged to them, my lord. <br>
TEGANA: My lord, I can hold my peace no longer. Forgive me. How can
that be? You claimed it in the Khan's name? <br>
POLO: It was wrong of me to do so. <br>
TEGANA: You wear the Khan's gold seal. It gives you your authority to
take what you will. <br>

POLO: I'd hoped you would allow me to return home, my lord. <br>
KHAN: Your gift has failed. It is ours because we won the right to keep
it in a game of chance. Where is the key? <br>

KHAN: Bring it to us after the banquet, and then we'll examine our
prize. <br>
POLO: My lord, you do me a great wrong. <br>

think about it. You'll also attend us after the banquet, Lord Tegana.

drank a potion of quicksilver and sulphur, the elixir of life and

Samarkand? Or would you like to stay a while in our Court and brighten
all our days? <br>

Our mind dwells upon your conduct, Marco, and we've decided that you
have to prove yourself worthy of our trust. If you fail this to do, we
take from you our patronage, banish you from our Court, and let your
enemies fall upon you. You have the key of the caravan? <br>

playing, he must have decided upon a long time before we appeared on
the scene. <br>
BARBARA: I remember! <br>
DOCTOR: Hmmm? <br>
BARBARA: The Khan was furious because Noghai had moved his armies from
Samarkand to Karakorum. <br>
DOCTOR: And that's why he delayed Marco Polo's caravan. To give Noghai
more time to move his armies nearer Peking. <br>
IAN: Yes, that makes sense. Even so, why should Kublai Khan fear
Noghai? He has an enormous army, and he's already defeated him once,
surely. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but what you have to take into account where battles are
concerned, dear boy, are its leaders. Kill the leader, and where are
you? What happens? The whole army dissipates itself into chaos and
utter confusion. It's happened throughout your history time and time
again! <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, do you mean to say Tegana's going to assassinate
the Khan? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly, and what could be a better answer then to disorganise
everything here. It gives Noghai the perfect answer to overrun the
country. <br>
