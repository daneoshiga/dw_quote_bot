ROSE [OC]: Peter Alan Tyler my dad. The most wonderful man in the
world. Born 15th September 1954. <br>
JACKIE: Come here, Rose. Come here <br>
(Jackie has got a photograph album open. Little Rose joins her on the
bed.) <br>
JACKIE: Who's that? It's your daddy. You weren't old enough to remember
when he died. 1987, 7th of November. Do you remember what I told you?
The day that Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clarke got married. He was always
having adventures. Oh, he would have loved to have seen you now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: That's what Mum always says. So I was
thinking, could we, could we go and see my dad when he was still alive?
<br>
DOCTOR: Where's this come from, all of a sudden? <br>
ROSE: All right then, if we can't, if it goes against the laws of times
or something, then never mind, just leave it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I can do anything. I'm just more worried about you. <br>
ROSE: I want to see him. <br>
DOCTOR: Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. </font></p>

ROSE: I thought he'd be taller. <br>
REGISTRAR: To be my lawful wedded wife, to love and behold till death

there. I only wish there'd been someone there for him. <br>

ROSE: It's so weird. The day my father died. I thought it'd be all sort
of grim and stormy. It's just an ordinary day. <br>
DOCTOR: The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. Are
you sure about this? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Jordan Road]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: This is it. Jordan Road. He was late. He'd
been to get a wedding present, a vase. Mum always said, that stupid
vase. <br>
(A green van comes around the corner. D602 PKW) <br>
ROSE: He got out of his car. <br>
(It pulls into the kerb.) <br>
ROSE: And crossed the road. <br>
ROSE: Oh, God. This is it. <br>
(As Pete gets out of the van, the Doctor takes Rose's hand. A beige car
comes round the corner - NEH 793W - and straight into Pete. The driver
shields his face with his arm and keeps going, leaving Pete and the
broken vase in the middle of the road. Pete tries to move.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go to him, quick. <br>
(But she can't. Later, round the corner, as sirens approach.) <br>
ROSE: It's too late now. By the time the ambulance got there, he was
dead. He can't die on his own. Can I try again? <br>
(The Doctor and Rose look round the corner to see themselves by the
kerbside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, that's the first you and me. It's a very bad idea, two
sets of us being here at the same time. Just be careful they don't see
us. Wait till she runs off and he follows, then go to your dad. <br>
(Pete parks at the kerb.) <br>
ROSE 1: Oh, God. This is it. <br>
ROSE: I can't do this. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't have to do anything you don't want to, but this is
the last time we can be here. <br>
(Rose runs forward as Pete is getting out of the van.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rose! No! <br>
(Rose dashes past her earlier self and pushes her father out of the
path of the beige car. The vase rolls away, unbroken. The earlier
Doctor and Rose vanish.) <br>
ROSE: I did it. I saved your life. <br>
PETE: Blimey, did you see the speed of it? Did you get his number? <br>
ROSE: I really did it. Oh, my God, look at you. You're alive! That car
was going to
kill you. <br>
PETE: Give me some credit, I did see it coming. I wasn't going to walk
under it, was I. <br>
ROSE: I'm Rose. <br>
PETE: That's a coincidence. That's my daughter's name. <br>
ROSE: That's a great name. Good choice. Well done. <br>
PETE: Right, I'd better shift. I've got a wedding to go to. <br>
ROSE: Is that Sarah Clarke's wedding? <br>
PETE: Yeah, are you going? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. <br>
PETE: You and your boyfriend need a lift? <br>
(Something with blood red eyesight flies over South London.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PETE: Right, there we go. Sorry about the mess. If
you want a cup of tea, the kitchens just down there, milk's in the
fridge. Well, it would be, wouldn't it. Where else would you put the
milk? Mind you, there's always the window sill outside. I always
thought if someone invented a window sill with special compartments,
you know, one for milk, one for yogurt, make a lot of money out of
that. Sell it to students and things. I should write that down. Anyway,
never mind that, excuse me for a minute. Got to go and change. <br>
(Pete goes to the bedroom.) <br>
ROSE: All the stuff mum kept. His stuff. She kept it all packed away in
boxes in the cupboard. She used to show me when she'd had a bit to
drink. Here it is, on display. Where it should be. Third prize at the
bowling. First two got to go to Didcot. Health drinks. Tonics, mum used
to call them. He made his money selling this Vitex stuff. He had all
sorts of jobs. He was so clever. Solar power. Mum said he was
going to do this. Now he can. Okay, look I'll tell him you're not my
boyfriend. <br>
DOCTOR: When we met, I said travel with me in space. You said no. Then
I said time machine. <br>
ROSE: It wasn't some big plan. I just saw it happening and I thought, I
can stop it. <br>
DOCTOR: I did it again. I picked another stupid ape. I should've known.
It's not about showing you the universe. It never is. It's about the
universe doing something for you. <br>
ROSE: So it's okay when you go to other times, and you save people's
lives, but not when it's me saving my dad. <br>
DOCTOR: I know what I'm doing, you don't. Two sets of us being there
made that a vulnerable point. <br>
ROSE: But he's alive! <br>
DOCTOR: My entire planet died. My whole family. Do you think it never
occurred to me to go back and save them? <br>
ROSE: But it's not like I've changed history. Not much. I mean he's
never going to
be a world leader. He's not going to start World War Three or anything.
<br>
DOCTOR: Rose, there's a man alive in the world who wasn't alive before.
An ordinary man. That's the most important thing in creation. The whole
world's different because he's alive. <br>
ROSE: What, would you rather him dead? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not saying that. <br>
ROSE: No, I get it! For once, you're not the most important man in my
life. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's see how you get on without me, then. Give me the key. The
Tardis key. If I'm so insignificant, give it me back. <br>
ROSE: All right then, I will. <br>
(Rose hands over the key.) <br>
DOCTOR: You've got what you wanted, so that's goodbye, then. <br>
ROSE: You don't scare me. I know how sad you are. You'll be back in a
minute, or you'll hang around outside the Tardis waiting for me. And
I'll make you wait a long time! <br>
(The Doctor leaves and Rose slams the door behind him. Pete puts his
head round the bedroom door.) <br>
PETE: Boyfriend trouble? <br>
(The red-eyed thing flies over the area, then a man clipping a shrub
suddenly disappears with a brief scream, followed by a woman pegging
out the washing and a tramp drinking cider. Indoors, Rose is putting
peanuts back into their bowl. Pete has changed into his wedding suit.) <br>
PETE: Excuse me, do you mind? What're you tidying up for? <br>
ROSE: Sorry. Force of habit. <br>
PETE: Listen, don't worry about him. Couples have rows all the time. <br>
ROSE: We're not a couple. Why does everyone think we're a couple? I
think he left me. <br>
PETE: What, a pretty girl like you? If I was going out with you <br>
ROSE: Stop right there. <br>
PETE: I was just saying <br>
ROSE: I know what you're saying, and we're not going there. At no point
are we going anywhere near there. You aren't even aware that there
exists. I don't even want to think about there, and believe me, neither
do you. There for you is like, like the Bermuda Triangle. <br>
PETE: Blimey, you know how to flatter a bloke. <br>
ROSE: Right, are we off? <br>
(Rose offers Pete her arm.) <br>
PETE: So, that wouldn't be a mixed signal at all? <br>
ROSE: Absolutely not. <br>
PETE: I'll take you back to the loony bin where you belong. Except I'm
sure I've met you somewhere before. </font></p>

the Baxters. Where are they? You don't think something's gone wrong? <br>

JACKIE: What, with the rest of the rubbish? You bring home cut-price
detergents, tonic water, Betamax tapes and none of it works. I'm
drowning in your rubbish. What did he tell you? Did he say he's this
big businessman, 'cos he's not. He's a failure. Born failure, that one.

big kid. <br>

maybe you did. <br>

ROSE: A time machine. <br>
PETE: Time machine. <br>
ROSE: Cross my heart. <br>
PETE: What, do you all have time machines where you come from? <br>
ROSE: No, just the Doctor. <br>
PETE: Did you know these things were coming? <br>
ROSE: No. <br>
PETE: God, I don't know, my head's spinning. What's the future like? <br>
ROSE: It's not so different. <br>
PETE: What am I like? Have I gone grey? Have I gone bald? Don't tell me
I've gone bald. So, if this mate of yours isn't your boyfriend and I
have to say, I'm glad, because being your dad and all, I think he's a
bit old for you. Have you got a bloke? <br>
ROSE: No, I did have. <br>
JACKIE [OC]: Mickey! <br>
(Little Mickey runs up to Rose and hugs her.) <br>
PETE: Do you know him? <br>
ROSE: I just didn't recognise him in a suit. You have to let go of me,
sweetheart. I'm always saying that. <br>
JACKIE: He just grabs hold of what's passing and holds on for dear
life. God help his poor girlfriend if he ever gets one. <br>
PETE: Me and Rose were just talking. <br>
JACKIE: Oh, yeah? Talking? While the world comes to an end, what do you
do? Cling to the youngest blonde. Come on, Mick. <br>
(Jackie and Mickey leave.) <br>
ROSE: You can't tell her. <br>
PETE: Why? <br>
ROSE: I mean, I really don't want you to tell her. <br>
PETE: What, do you don't want people to know? <br>
ROSE: Where I come from, Jackie doesn't know how to work the timer on
the video recorder. <br>
PETE: I showed her that last week. Point taken. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is talking to baby Rose in her carrycot
by the choir stalls.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Rose you're not going to bring about the end of the world,
are you? Are you? <br>
(Rose walks up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jackie gave her to me to look after. How times change. <br>
ROSE: I'd better be careful. I think I just imprinted myself on Mickey
like a mother chicken. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Don't touch the baby. You're both the same person. That's a
paradox, and we don't want a paradox happening, not with these things
outside. Anything new, any disturbance in time makes them stronger. The
paradox might let them in. <br>
ROSE: Can't do anything right, can I? <br>
DOCTOR: Since you ask, no. So, don't touch the baby. <br>
ROSE: I'm not stupid. <br>
DOCTOR: You could have fooled me. All right, I'm sorry. I wasn't really
going to
leave you on your own. <br>
ROSE: I know. <br>
DOCTOR: But between you and me, I haven't got a plan. No idea. No way
out. <br>
ROSE: You'll think of something. <br>
DOCTOR: The entire Earth's been sterilised. This, and other place like
it, are all that's left of the human race. We might hold out for a
while, but nothing can stop those creatures. They'll get through in the
end. The walls aren't that old. And there's nothing I can do to stop
them. There used to be laws stopping this kind of thing from happening.
My people would have stopped this. But they're all gone. And now I'm
going the same way. <br>
ROSE: If I'd realised. <br>
DOCTOR: Just tell me you're sorry. <br>
ROSE: I am. I'm sorry. <br>
(They hug.) <br>
ROSE: Have you got something hot? <br>
(She reaches into his inside pocket, takes out a key and drops it
because it is glowing hot.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's the Tardis key! <br>
(He takes off his jacket to pick it up safely.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's telling me it's still connected to the Tardis. <br>
(He makes an announcement from the pulpit.) <br>
DOCTOR: The inside of my ship was thrown out of the wound but we can
use this to bring it back. And once I've got my ship back, then I can
mend everything. Now, I just need a bit of power. Has anybody got a
battery? <br>
(Stuart picks up the mobile phone.) <br>
STUART: This one big enough? <br>
DOCTOR: Fantastic. <br>
STUART: Good old dad. There you go. <br>
DOCTOR: Just need to do a bit of charging up and then we can bring
everyone back. <br>
(He uses the ever-versatile sonic screwdriver while the creatures
batter at the doors. Pete and Rose have a quiet chat.) <br>
PETE: You, er, you never said why you came here in the first place. If
I had a time machine, I wouldn't have thought 1987 was anything
special. Not round here, anyway. <br>
ROSE: We just ended up here. <br>
PETE: Lucky for me, eh? If you hadn't been there to save me. <br>
ROSE: That was just a coincidence. That was just really good luck. It's
amazing. <br>
PETE: So, in the future, are me and her indoors still together? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. <br>
PETE: Are you still living with us? <br>
ROSE: Yep. <br>
PETE: Am I a good dad? <br>
ROSE: You, you told me a bedtime story every night when I was small.
You were always there. You never missed one. And er, you took us for
picnics in the country every Saturday. You never let us down. You were
there for us all the time. Someone I could really rely on. <br>
PETE: That's not me. <br>
(The Tardis slowly materialises around her key.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, no one touches that key. Have you got that? Don't touch
it. Anyone touches that key, it'll be, well, zap. Just leave it be and
everything will be fine. We'll get out of here. All of us. Stuart,
Sarah you're
going to get married, just like I said. <br>
(Outside, the car repeats its brief drive around the corner. Inside,
the Tardis is fading in and out.) <br>
ROSE: When time gets sorted out <br>
DOCTOR: Everybody here forgets what happened. And don't worry, the
thing that you changed will stay changed. <br>
PETE: You mean I'll still be alive, though I'm meant to be dead. That's
why I haven't done anything with my life, why I didn't mean anything. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't work like that. <br>
PETE: Rubbish. I'm so useless I couldn't even die properly. Now it's my
fault all of this has happened. <br>
ROSE: This is my fault. <br>
PETE: No, love. I'm your dad. It's my job for it to be my fault. <br>
JACKIE: Her dad? How are you her dad? How old were you, twelve? Oh,
that's disgusting. <br>
PETE: Jacks, listen. This is Rose. <br>
JACKIE: Rose? How sick is that? You give my daughter a second hand
name? How many are there? Do you call them all Rose? <br>
PETE: Oh, for God's sake, look. It's the same Rose! <br>
(Pete takes baby Rose from Jackie and hands her to Rose.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rose! No! <br>
(The Doctor snatches her away too late and gives her back to Jackie. A
creature appears inside the Church.) <br>
DOCTOR: Everyone, behind me! I'm the oldest thing in here. <br>
ROSE: Doctor! <br>
(The creature pounces on the Doctor, then flies over to the Tardis.
They touch, the Tardis and the creature vanish, and the key falls to
the floor. Rose runs to pick it up.) <br>
ROSE: It's cold. The key's cold. Oh, my God, he's dead. This is all my
fault. Both of you. All of you. The whole world. <br>
BEV: This is it. There's nothing we can do. It's the end. <br>
(As the creatures start scraping at the stonework outside, Pete watches
the car drive around the corner again and again from the vestry window.
He goes back into the church and over to Rose, who is sitting on her
own.) <br>
PETE: The Doctor really cared about you. He didn't want you to go
through it again, not if there was another way. Now there isn't. <br>
ROSE: What are you talking about? <br>
PETE: The car that should have killed me, love. It's here. The Doctor
worked it out way back, but he, er, he tried to protect me. Still, he's
not in charge anymore. I am. <br>
ROSE: But you can't. <br>
PETE: Who am I, love? <br>
ROSE: My daddy. <br>
PETE: Jackie, look at her. She's ours. <br>
JACKIE: Oh, of course. <br>
(Jackie hugs the weeping Rose.) <br>
PETE: I'm meant to be dead, Jackie. You're going to get rid of me at
last. <br>
JACKIE: Don't say that. <br>
PETE: For once in your life, trust me. It's got be done. You've got to
survive, because you've got to bring up our daughter. I never read you
those bedtime stories. I never took you on those picnics. I was never
there for you. <br>
ROSE: You would have been. <br>
PETE: But I can do this for you. I can be a proper dad to you now. <br>
ROSE: But it's not fair. <br>
PETE: I've had all these extra hours. No one else in the world has ever
had that. And on top of that, I got to see you. And you're beautiful.
How lucky am I, eh? So, come on, do as your dad says. You going to be
there for me, love? Thanks for saving me. </font></p>
