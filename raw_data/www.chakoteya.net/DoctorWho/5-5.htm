<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor's evil double, Salamander, has been
sucked out of the Tardis while it is in flight. The Doctor and Victoria
are hanging on to the console base.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie! The doors! We've got to close the doors! Can you
do it? <br>
(Jamie is hanging onto a wall roundel on the opposite wall to the
doors.) <br>
JAMIE: I'll try, Doctor, but I'll have to get to a better position. <br>
DOCTOR: That's it, Victoria. Hold on. Whatever you do, hold on! <br>
VICTORIA: I'm slipping! <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, you're not. I've got hold of you. Don't look out there.
Concentrate on holding on. <br>
VICTORIA: I can't! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you can. That's the style. <br>
JAMIE: Right, Doctor, I'm going to try and fall to the control panel. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, but watch the Tardis doesn't lurch again. <br>
(Jamie falls backwards onto the console.) <br>
JAMIE: Made it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well done. <br>
JAMIE: So far, so good. <br>
DOCTOR: You know the switch? <br>
JAMIE: Aye. Found it. I'm nearly there. <br>
(Jamie reaches for the lever, then falls. He grabs on to the Doctor's
coat before he slides down towards the doors.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, they're closing! <br>
(The Tardis doors shut tight.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie. You did it! That was a near thing, wasn't
it? Are you all right, Victoria? <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, what happened? Are we safe now? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I think so. Salamander started the Tardis without first
closing the door. He was sucked out. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, and I nearly joined him. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm very glad you didn't. He's not in a very enviable position,
you know, at the moment, floating around in time and space. Now then,
where shall we go? <br>
JAMIE: Oh, let's just get our breath back first before you start
tearing off anywhere. Anyway, as you know the Tardis has a mind of its
own. You know you can't control it. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't control it? <br>
JAMIE: No. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll see about that. We'll see about that. <br>
VICTORIA: Here we go again. <br>
JAMIE: I wonder where it'll be this time. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder.

at by a grey-bearded Travers. A door opens.) <br>
ANNE [OC]: Mister Silverstein? <br>
SILVERSTEIN [OC]: Yes. Who are you? <br>
ANNE [OC]: Anne Travers. Is my father here? <br>
SILVERSTEIN [OC]: Yes, he's here Come and see him, and take him away.
He's a fool, an old fool. <br>
(Other exhibits in the room include a baby giraffe.) <br>
ANNE: Father? Father. <br>
TRAVERS: Anne, what are you doing here? <br>
ANNE: Looking for you. <br>
TRAVERS: Oh? <br>
ANNE: You were supposed to be meeting me. <br>
TRAVERS: Was I? <br>
ANNE: At the airport. Father, what is the matter? You send me a cable
saying you're in grave trouble, and I have flown half the way around
the world <br>
TRAVERS: Trouble. Yes, a great deal of trouble. And it's that thing! <br>
ANNE: The Yeti? <br>
TRAVERS: You're a stupid old fool, Julius Silverstein. <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Oh, me the fool? You would like me to be the fool and give
you back my Yeti, huh? <br>
TRAVERS: Well, you must, man. Don't you understand? It's dangerous. <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Huh! For thirty years it stands here in my museum, and now
he tells me it is dangerous. <br>
TRAVERS: I wish I'd never brought it back from Tibet. <br>
ANNE: Father, what has happened? <br>
TRAVERS: Well, he won't listen to me. This silly old goat won't listen
to me. I've told him, warned him. Damn it, he knows it's a robot. <br>
ANNE: But Father, the Yeti isn't dangerous. It can't work unless it has
a control unit. <br>
TRAVERS: But I've done it, Anne! I have reactivated a control unit. <br>
ANNE: Oh, but Father, this is wonderful news. <br>
TRAVERS: Is it? Yes, yes, I suppose it would be, except for one thing. <br>
ANNE: What? <br>
TRAVERS: The sphere. It's gone. It's disappeared! Look, you must let me
have the Yeti back, Julius. Oh, make him understand, Anne. <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Oh, I understand. I buy the Yeti off you thirty years ago,
and now it is valuable. You try to scare me, take your Yeti back. Why?
Money! You want to rob me. <br>
TRAVERS: All right then, I'll buy the thing back if that's what you
want! <br>
SILVERSTEIN: No, no, no. It's priceless. The only one in the world, and
it is mine. <br>
TRAVERS: You fool. <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Thief! <br>
TRAVERS: I'm not a thief. <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Swindler! <br>
TRAVERS: Stubborn old goat! <br>
ANNE: Father! <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Take him away. Out of my house. <br>
ANNE: Father, look, perhaps you've made a mistake. You've put the
sphere away somewhere in your laboratory and forgotten it. You've done
it before, you know. <br>
TRAVERS: No, I've looked everywhere. <br>
ANNE: Well, let's go home and look again, shall we? You know what
you're like. <br>
TRAVERS: Yes, but suppose <br>
ANNE: Let's go and have a quiet dinner and you can tell me all about
it. Then we'll go home and we'll look for the sphere. <br>
TRAVERS: All right. But I warned you, Julius, I warned you. <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Get out! Take him away! Nobody destroys Julius
Silverstein's collection. Nobody! <br>
ANNE: Come on, Father. <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Nobody. The Yeti's mine. You can't scare me with your mad
stories. Out, out, out! <br>
(They leave the room. A silver sphere hovers in a window, beeping to
itself. It drops out of sight as Silverstein returns to blow out the
candles that illuminate his private collection. Then suddenly the
sphere smashes through the windowpane. Silverstein goes to
investigate.) <br>
SILVERSTEIN: Travers? Travers, is that you? I am not frightened by your
stupid tricks. Travers? I know it's you, I'm not a fool! <br>
(Silverstein comes round the corner and hears the beeping. The Yeti's
eyes light up and it attacks the little old German Jew.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAMIE: I tell you it did. It was flashing. <br>
(The Doctor is eating a sandwich.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie, if that light had come on, we'd have landed,
wouldn't we? <br>
JAMIE: Look, I'm not arguing about that. <br>
DOCTOR: But we're still travelling, aren't we? So how could it have
done? <br>
JAMIE: Look, I don't know. All I know is that thing came on. Now I've
not taken to seeing things. At least I don't think I have. <br>
(Victoria enters in a new Pocahontas style mini-dress, with her hair in
plaits.) <br>
VICTORIA: Hey, do you like it? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
VICTORIA: I found it in the chest. I think it looks very sophisticated,
don't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, very sophisticated, Victoria. Go on, Jamie. Don't you?
<br>
JAMIE: Aye. Now look, I'm not daft you know, Doctor. <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
VICTORIA: Why is that light flashing? <br>
JAMIE: Aha! <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Are you two playing some sort of game? <br>
JAMIE: There you are. Told you so. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, then we are landing, aren't we? <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
VICTORIA: Let's hope it's somewhere pleasant. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, it might even be Scotland. <br>
DOCTOR: Now shush. The scanner, that will tell us. <br>
VICTORIA: Where are we? <br>
JAMIE: Nothing but stars. What does it mean? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Something strange has happened. We're suspended
in space <br>
(Not just suspended, but being rapidly covered in cobwebs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gravity? <br>
JAMIE: On. <br>
DOCTOR: Power? <br>
VICTORIA: On. <br>
DOCTOR: Control? <br>
JAMIE: Er, on. <br>
DOCTOR: Flight. <br>
VICTORIA: That's on too. <br>
DOCTOR: There you are, you see? I was right. It is all working. <br>
JAMIE: You mean we've landed and yet we haven't landed? <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a minute, Victoria. If the time lock has slipped <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor, look at the scanner! <br>
(The view is being covered by cobwebs.) <br>
JAMIE: What is that stuff, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. But something or someone is holding us here.

is being put onto audio tape by a smarmy man in a bow-tie.) <br>
CHORLEY: And finally, Captain Knight, could you tell us your own
feelings about Colonel Pemberton? <br>
KNIGHT: Well, he was certainly a brave soldier. There's no doubt about
that. He gave his life for his country, and I was proud to serve under
him. Is that all right? <br>
CHORLEY: Oh, super. Sterling stuff! You talk in pure quotes, old boy. <br>
KNIGHT: Not just quotes, Mister Chorley. I meant what I said. <br>
(The Corporal enters and salutes.) <br>
BLAKE: Professor Travers is here, sir. <br>
TRAVERS: What the devil's going on? Why have I been brought here like
this? Who are you? <br>
KNIGHT: Knight <br>
TRAVERS: Never heard of you. Who? <br>
KNIGHT: Captain Knight. OK, Corporal. <br>
(The Corporal leaves.) <br>
KNIGHT: Look, it's no good shouting at me, Professor. I didn't ask for
you. <br>
TRAVERS: Who did, then? <br>
KNIGHT: Your daughter. <br>
TRAVERS: Anne? Just like her mother. Always interfering in things she
knows nothing about. <br>
KNIGHT: I understood that you'd sent for her to come back from America
and help you. <br>
TRAVERS: What do you want me for, anyway? <br>
KNIGHT: I don't. I consider this to be a military matter. Others
disagree. <br>
TRAVERS: Well, you haven't had much success so far, have you? <br>
(Knight leaves.) <br>
TRAVERS: Army. What the devil do they know about it? Who are you? <br>
CHORLEY: Harold Chorley, London Television. <br>
TRAVERS: Who? What? <br>
CHORLEY: Harold Chorley, London Television. <br>
TRAVERS: Television? Never watch it. You an actor or something? <br>
CHORLEY: Journalist, actually. The government, in its infinite wisdom,
decided only to allow one correspondent down here. The press chose me. <br>
TRAVERS: Oh yes? <br>
CHORLEY: Tell me, Professor, will you be in charge of the scientific
section, or will your daughter? <br>
TRAVERS: Mind your own business! <br>
CHORLEY: And how long do you think it's going to take you to come up
with the answer? One week? Three, perhaps? <br>
TRAVERS: Well how the hell should I know? Is that thing working? <br>
CHORLEY: Of course. <br>
TRAVERS: It's more than likely we won't be able to defeat this menace.
London, in fact the whole of England, might be completely wiped out.

JAMIE: That's the only one I could find. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh yes, that'll do, Jamie, I think. Just get that in there
and that'll be excellent. There we are, that should work. <br>
(The Doctor hands the box up to Jamie.) <br>
JAMIE: What does it do? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, no. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, nothing yet, but it will do once we start moving again. <br>
(Jamie drops the box and the Doctor catches it.) <br>
VICTORIA: Do you think we ever will? We've been here so long. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course we will, Victoria. You see, whatever's holding
us must let go sometime. <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, the scanner. It's clearing! <br>
(The cobwebs disappear.) <br>
VICTORIA: The scanner's cleared! <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Now Jamie, give me a hand while there's still time. Plug
this in. <br>
JAMIE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Plug it in there. Yes, that's right. Now listen, both of you.
As soon as we land, whatever you do, don't let go. Hold on. <br>
(The box is attached to the console.) <br>
VICTORIA: What's going to happen? We're landing <br>
DOCTOR: There. Now, hold tight <br>
(There is a piercing noise.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's not so bad as I thought. <br>
(There's a big jolt, and everyone falls down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is everyone all right? <br>
JAMIE: Aye. What did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've managed to move us on a bit. Not very far, perhaps
half a mile from where we were expected to land. For the moment, we
have eluded our captor. Look at the scanner, both of you. <br>
(It is a rounded tunnel lined with dressed stone and lit in places.) <br>
VICTORIA: Well, where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: I really don't know, Victoria. Shall we go out and have a look?
<br>
VICTORIA: Now, is it safe? <br>

going to need torches.

VICTORIA: Underground station? <br>
DOCTOR: Trains. Underground trains. A little after your time, I think,
Victoria. <br>
VICTORIA: Is it always as dark as this? <br>

what's going on first. <br>

VICTORIA: What do you want us to do, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: You follow the soldiers, but keep out of sight. I'm going to
see where this cable goes to. Meet back here in a few minutes, all
right? <br>

KNIGHT: No. We've tried chemicals, flame throwers, explosives. All to
no avail. <br>

Miss Travers, what progress have you made so far? <br>
ANNE: Well, my father and I think we may be able to jam the
transmissions to the Yeti. <br>
TRAVERS: What we really need is some additional equipment. <br>

KNIGHT: Well, sir, the main problem has been lack of communication. As
you know, this fog absorbs all radio waves. <br>

laid a couple of lines ourselves between here and Holborn, but I don't

were to blow the tunnel here, just above Goodge Street, we could seal
ourselves in for a bit. <br>

them. <br>

though, sir. <br>

and set a triggering device, and then blow it up while it's on the
move. <br>
COLONEL: Yes. Yes, that should work. <br>

it's hopeless! I tried to get back to HQ, I tried, but all the stations
were locked, you see, and I couldn't get back in. And all the time I
kept seeing more and more Yeti, and they were closing in on me. I was
retreating. I was always retreating, and then, at last I found I could
get into Piccadilly, but when I got down there, there was this machine
and that Professor, and a girl. And more Yeti. They're everywhere! <br>
ARNOLD: My, my, my. We are in a state, aren't we, sir. <br>
CHORLEY: Yes. All right. So, I'm frightened. Well so would you be if
you'd been up there. <br>
ARNOLD: It's all right, sir. Nothing to be ashamed of. <br>
CHORLEY: Yes. <br>
ARNOLD: There's just one thing that puzzles me though, sir. <br>
CHORLEY: Oh, what's that? <br>
ARNOLD: How you managed to exist all this time. Why didn't the Yetis
get you? <br>
CHORLEY: Look, Sergeant, what are you suggesting? You're not suggesting
that I <br>
ARNOLD: Oh no, sir, I was just wondering, that's all. I think perhaps
you'd better come along with me, don't you, sir? Come on now.

DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
ANNE: The control box. <br>
DOCTOR: It's in my pocket. <br>
ANNE: Well, why don't you use it on these Yeti, and then maybe we can
escape. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face. <br>
COLONEL: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
COLONEL: Been thinking. The Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's
disappearance yet. Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, go on. <br>
COLONEL: Well, I don't really know how to say this, but there's Miss
Travers and Victoria to think of, and, er <br>
DOCTOR: You mean, am I going to give myself up? <br>
COLONEL: Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, yours alone. But
the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria. <br>
DOCTOR: You believe that? <br>
COLONEL: Well, why not? <br>
(Anne hears beeps.) <br>
ANNE: Hello, we've got company. <br>
(Two Yeti come out of the tunnel carrying Evans, and put him down.) <br>
EVANS: Hello, sir. <br>
COLONEL: Evans, where the devil have you been? <br>
EVANS: Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir? <br>
COLONEL: Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me. <br>
EVANS: Desertion? Me? Oh, good heavens, no. No, I thought I'd try a
single-handed and desperate attempt to rescue Professor Travers and the
girl. Isn't Staff Arnold about? <br>
ANNE: No. <br>
EVANS: Good. <br>
(One of the Yeti steps behind the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. <br>
(It pushes him up the steps to the ticket hall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now listen, everyone. When the Yeti come for you, don't
struggle. Whatever you do, don't resist them. <br>
EVANS: Don't struggle, he says. He must be joking. <br>
COLONEL: The Doctor will have to give in. There's no other choice. <br>
EVANS: Aye, aye, time to get fell in. <br>
(They are moved off along the platform by the Yeti. When all have gone,
the lid of a sand bin is lifted and Jamie looks out.)

holding a helmet-like device. It makes to put it on the Doctor's head,
then both Yeti stop beeping. The control box has worked. The Doctor
takes the device and examines it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
(The Doctor makes some adjustments to the device and gives it back to
the Yeti, then switches off the control box again. The Yeti puts the
device on the Doctor's head.) </font></p>

JAMIE: Come towards me. Like that, that's it. Come to. Right now, raise
your right arm. Raise your right arm! <br>

ANNE: Yes, yes, I think so. <br>

INTELLIGENCE [OC]: Yes, he is perfectly all right. Thank you, Doctor,
for being so cooperative. <br>
COLONEL: Why don't you show yourself? Who are you? <br>
INTELLIGENCE [OC]: Silence. You will know soon enough. <br>
(Chorley enters with a Yeti.) <br>
VICTORIA: Chorley? <br>
COLONEL: Chorley? <br>
TRAVERS: Good grief. <br>
ANNE: That horrible little man? <br>
EVANS: You, the Intelligence? <br>
ANNE: No.! <br>
COLONEL: No, he can't be the Intelligence. He can't be. It doesn't make
sense. <br>
(CHORLEY, having recovered his breath, is flustered and close to tears.
He turns and points down the passageway.) <br>
CHORLEY: It isn't me. It isn't me. Don't you understand? I'm not the
Intelligence. The Intelligence is him! <br>
(Arnold comes out of the shadows.) <br>
TRAVERS: It can't be! <br>
ANNE: Oh, it's too horrible. I don't believe it! <br>
(Arnold's face is blank.) <br>
ANNE: Arnold. <br>
ARNOLD: (no accent) No, merely Arnold's lifeless body in which I have
concealed myself. But let us to work. There will be time for discussion
later. In fact, all the time in the world. <br>
ANNE: Oh, so you weren't going to let us go then afterwards. <br>
TRAVERS: Did you think he would? <br>
ARNOLD: The last member of the party. Come and join us. <br>
(A Yeti brings Jamie in.) <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, Jamie! <br>
JAMIE: Victoria, are you all right? <br>
VICTORIA: Yes. <br>
ARNOLD: Your solicitude is touching. Nevertheless, it is wasting time. <br>
DOCTOR: Frightened that something might go wrong? <br>
ARNOLD: Join the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Do what he says, Jamie. <br>
ARNOLD: Take him! <br>
(A Yeti grabs Jamie around the neck.) <br>
ARNOLD: I must ensure your complete cooperation, Doctor. Should you
prove at all unhelpful, your young friend's neck will be broken. <br>
DOCTOR: You gave your word that no one would be harmed. I refuse to
submit until you release Jamie! <br>
ARNOLD: All right. Release the boy. But at the first sign of trouble
from you <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I will do what you say. <br>
ARNOLD: Good. Into the machine, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor steps into the pyramid.) <br>
TRAVERS: What's he going to do? <br>
COLONEL: What's happening? <br>
(There is a chair under a mass of circuitry. The Doctor sits in it.
Arnold makes some adjustments then lowers a metal circlet onto the
helmet the Doctor is wearing.) <br>
ARNOLD: Soon your mind will be absorbed by the Great Intelligence. You
should be very proud, Doctor. Your knowledge of the past will help to
shape the future of this planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Just get on with it, please. <br>
ARNOLD: You seem very anxious suddenly. <br>
DOCTOR: I just want it over and done with. <br>
ARNOLD: Submission is essential. You must understand, Doctor, that
without your complete cooperation this transference would be of no
value. Should you offer any opposition, either physical or mental, I
shall be forced to punish you, or rather your friends. Prepare for a
great darkness to cloud your mind. <br>
JAMIE: Attack now! Attack the Yeti! <br>
(The tame Yeti turns on the other Yeti.) <br>
JAMIE: Get Arnold! <br>
(It attacks Arnold.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
COLONEL: Get the Doctor out! <br>
(The Doctor shakes off attempts to rescue him.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, you don't understand. You'll ruin everything! No! <br>
JAMIE: Professor! Anne! Give us some help! <br>
DOCTOR: No! No! No! Leave me be! You don't understand. I've got to stay
here! <br>
(Evans and the Colonel pull the Doctor out of the pyramid and Jamie
throws the headset into it. BOOM! The Yeti all collapse.) <br>
EVANS: Well, that's that then, innit? <br>
DOCTOR: You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're
told! <br>
JAMIE: Hey, now just a minute, Doctor. If we hadn't pulled you out of
that, you'd have been a heap of dust by now. <br>
DOCTOR: You're just as bad. I told you to leave it to me! Now you've
gone and ruined everything. <br>
JAMIE: Ruined everything? How can we? We we've won, haven't we? <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
TRAVERS: What do you mean, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, why didn't they leave it to me? I had crossed those wires
on that helmet thing. The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I
would have drained the Intelligence! As it is, all we got was a crossed
circuit. <br>
ANNE: You mean, all we've done is cut off its contact with Earth? It's
still out there in space somewhere, flying around? <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely! Look. <br>
(Arnold lies dead, a charred husk.) <br>
VICTORIA: Oh! <br>
CHORLEY: Oh, poor fellow! <br>
COLONEL: Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence? <br>
DOCTOR: No. He was just a poor soldier that was taken over. He was
probably one of the first to disappear. <br>
EVANS: You mean it might come back? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's still around, isn't it? I've failed. <br>
TRAVERS: Nonsense, man. <br>
ANNE: You were marvellous. <br>
COLONEL: Yes. Great victory. <br>
DOCTOR: I doubt it. <br>
ANNE: No, you were a hero, and you know it. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't really think so, do you. <br>
ANNE: Yes, yes,. I do. <br>
CHORLEY: You've got to face facts, old man. By tomorrow morning you're
going to be a household word, a national figure. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. Oh, no. <br>
CHORLEY: Yes. I want you on my television programme, and <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no! <br>
CHORLEY: and I want to organise a big press conference, and <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie! Victoria! Come along, it's time we left. <br>
CHORLEY: But the press conference, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye! <br>
TRAVERS: But Doctor? Doctor, you can't go yet. There are a lot of
things I want to discuss with you. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go. <br>
CHORLEY: Where are you going? <br>
DOCTOR: Covent Garden. Come along. Come along, Jamie. Goodbye, Travers.
<br>
TRAVERS: Goodbye Victoria, dear. Goodbye. Goodbye. <br>
(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria disappear down to the platform.) <br>
ANNE: Where's he going? <br>
TRAVERS: Oh, er, back to his Tardis, I suppose. <br>
CHORLEY: You mean this, uh, this time machine thing, it really exists? <br>
TRAVERS: Well, I, er. Oh, explain it to him, Anne, will you? Colonel, I
think we'd better check up top, don't you? <br>
COLONEL: Right, Professor. Evans! <br>
ANNE: Father? Father, I <br>
CHORLEY: Now don't you go, Miss Travers. I'd like you to explain all
about this time machine for me. <br>
ANNE: Oh, dear.
