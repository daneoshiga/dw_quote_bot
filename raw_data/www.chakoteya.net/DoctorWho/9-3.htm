BOWMAN: Give your position, please. Give your position. <br>
(The base commander, Captain Hart, enters from outside the complex as
Bowman tries to listen through the static.) <br>
HART: What is it? <br>
BOWMAN: It's a Mayday, sir. SS Pevensey Castle, they say they're being
attacked.

island in an even smaller boat.) <br>
ROBBINS: That's it over there. <br>
(The Doctor looks through a pair of binoculars at what is really Norris
Castle on the Isle of Wight.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you are, Jo. That's the Master's permanent residence from
now on. <br>
JO: Well, let's hope he's still there.

ROBBINS: I'll be back in a couple of hours to take you over to the
mainland. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>

stripped out Citroen 2CV with no doors.)

telephone.) <br>
TRENCHARD: Yes? <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Main gate. Two visitors for the prisoner, sir, from UNIT.
Passes all in order, sir. <br>
TRENCHARD: Right, send them up. <br>
(The Doctor and Jo are let in through the gate and showed up to the
office by an armed guard. Trenchard is working at his desk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose we could always come back later, <br>
TRENCHARD: Oh, yes, of course. You'll be the chappie from UNIT. <br>
JO: My name's Josephine Grant. How do you do? And this is the Doctor. <br>
TRENCHARD: Colonel Trenchard. Delighted to meet you. Pleasant trip? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. <br>
TRENCHARD: You're late, you know? <br>
JO: Yes, we were held up. <br>
TRENCHARD: Mmm, thought you might have sunk without trace. <br>
JO: Sunk? <br>
TRENCHARD: Happens all the time recently. <br>
DOCTOR: What does? <br>
(Trenchard gives a piece of paper to the guard, who leaves with it.) <br>
TRENCHARD: Ships vanishing. Makes you think, doesn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: It does indeed. <br>
TRENCHARD: Now then, passes? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, look, we've been through all that, actually. <br>
TRENCHARD: We don't take any chances here. Let's see them. <br>
(Jo hands them over.) <br>
TRENCHARD: Oh. Ah, yes, from UNIT. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right, yes. <br>
TRENCHARD: Yes. Ah, jolly good. Well, you'll be wanting to see the
prisoner. <br>
DOCTOR: That was the general idea. <br>
TRENCHARD: He's an interesting chap, you know. You'll enjoy talking to
him. <br>
DOCTOR: If ever I get the opportunity. Has he given you any trouble as
yet? <br>
TRENCHARD: Not a bit. <br>
JO: You've got to be joking! He must have tried to escape? <br>
TRENCHARD: You've seen our security precautions. Anyway, we're on an
island. <br>
DOCTOR: Has he tried to hypnotise any of the guards, by any chance? <br>
TRENCHARD: He couldn't. All our men are completely immune to hypnotism.
<br>
JO: How can you be so sure? <br>
TRENCHARD: Prove it to you. (into intercom) Trenchard here. Send that
new man, Wilson, in to see the prisoner. Now then, come over here and
take a look into this screen. <br>
(The monitor shows the Master sitting and reading.) <br>
DOCTOR: My word, he's putting on weight. <br>
TRENCHARD: Poor chap, he can't get the exercise. Now then, watch.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Closer to a hotel room than a prison cell. There
are even some carvings for decoration. The guard enters.) <br>
WILSON: Mister Trenchard sent me, sir, to see if you wanted your book
changed. <br>
MASTER: Well, that's very kind of him, but I haven't quite finished
yet. <br>
WILSON: Right you are, sir. <br>
MASTER: Just a minute. You're new here, aren't you? <br>
WILSON: Arrived yesterday, sir. <br>
MASTER: Wait. Do you know who I am? <br>
WILSON: You're the prisoner. <br>
MASTER: I am the Master. Come here. <br>
(Wilson walks towards the Master, who rises to look him in the eyes.) <br>
MASTER: I am the Master and you will obey me. You understand? You will
obey me. <br>
WILSON: You'll let us know when you've finished with the book, sir? <br>
(Wilson leaves.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TRENCHARD: You see? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, very impressive. Perhaps we could see him now, yes? <br>
TRENCHARD: Certainly. This way. After you, my dear.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Trenchard leads the way along a corridor to the
cell and enters. The Master is now working out on a rowing machine.) <br>
TRENCHARD: Visitors for you. <br>
MASTER: Why, Doctor! And Miss Grant! What a very pleasant surprise. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, how are you? <br>
MASTER: Well, as you see, very well. Trying to keep fit. <br>
TRENCHARD: Yes, well, I'll leave you all together. Give the guard a
shout when you want to leave. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, Colonel. <br>
(Trenchard leaves.) <br>
MASTER: He's quite a decent sort, really. Used to be the Governor of a
colony once, so he tells me. <br>
DOCTOR: Very small colony, wasn't it? In fact, I believe they claimed
independence soon after he arrived. <br>
JO: He seems to be looking after you very well. <br>
MASTER: Oh, yes, I've got everything I want, except, of course, my
freedom. <br>
DOCTOR: You can consider yourself lucky. Quite a few people were in
favour of having you executed. <br>
MASTER: My dear Doctor, don't think I'm not grateful. I've had a chance
to think about things while I've been in here. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you now? <br>
MASTER: I wish that something like this had happened a long time ago. <br>
JO: Surely you don't like being locked up? <br>
MASTER: No, but, it's given me a chance to reconsider my life. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I to take it that you're a changed man? <br>
(The Master washes his hands in the en-suite.) <br>
MASTER: Is that so very incredible? After all, I do have a great deal
of which to repent. <br>
JO: You're telling us. <br>
DOCTOR: In that case, perhaps you'd like to tell me the whereabouts of
your Tardis? <br>
MASTER: So that you could use it in order to escape from this planet,
Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No, so that I can make absolutely certain that you can't. <br>
MASTER: No, I'm sorry. That is too much to ask. <br>
DOCTOR: Ask a silly question. Come on, Jo. I think we'd better be
going. Is there anything that I can do for you at all? <br>
MASTER: There is one thing. Please come in now and then to have a chat.
Oh, Trenchard's a very nice man, but his conversation is somewhat
limited. <br>
JO: Goodbye. <br>
MASTER: Goodbye, Miss Grant. And goodbye, Doctor. I sincerely hope we
meet again very soon. <br>
(The Doctor nearly shakes the Master's hand, but turns the gesture into
a wave.) <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye. <br>
(The Master gets back on his rowing machine, laughing.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JO: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm? <br>
JO: You felt sorry for him, didn't you. You wanted to come down here
and see that was all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he used to be a friend of mine once. A very good friend.
In fact, you might almost say we were at school together. <br>
JO: How long's he going to be here? <br>
DOCTOR: Forever, I should think. <br>
(Trenchard enters.) <br>
TRENCHARD: Ah, ready for off, then? I'd better stamp your passes. <br>
DOCTOR: What, again? <br>
TRENCHARD: Got to be checked in and out, old man. It's the rule. Well,
we don't look after him too badly, do we? <br>
DOCTOR: No, indeed. But I advise you to be careful. He's a very
dangerous man. <br>
TRENCHARD: Ah, don't worry. I keep my eye on him. There you are, my
dear. Come along now then. <br>
JO: Thank you. <br>
TRENCHARD: I'll get one of my chaps to run you down to the quayside. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you.

crossword. Times, probably.) <br>
TRENCHARD: There we are, then. Fooled them nicely, didn't we? <br>
MASTER: I hope so. <br>
TRENCHARD: What about that hypnotism wheeze, eh? That took them in. <br>
MASTER: Don't underestimate the Doctor. Do you really believe that he
came here to see me? <br>
(The Master takes a dictionary from a bookcase to help with his
crossword.) <br>
TRENCHARD: Why else? <br>
MASTER: Vanishing ships, of course. <br>
TRENCHARD: Oh, I don't think so. No, he didn't seem particularly
interested when I mentioned it. <br>
MASTER: You did what! <br>
TRENCHARD: We were just chatting. No harm done, surely. <br>
MASTER: Let's hope not. By the way, what about those admiralty charts I
asked for? <br>
TRENCHARD: They'll be here this afternoon. <br>
MASTER: Ah, splendid. Er, there is one more thing. <br>
TRENCHARD: Yes? <br>
MASTER: I wonder, do you think I could have another television set? For
the bedroom. <br>
TRENCHARD: Yes. Yes, I'm sure that's possible. <br>
MASTER: Colour, of course. <br>
TRENCHARD: Of course! Well, if you'll excuse me?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROBBINS: Ah, it's true. Three ships vanished.
Something queer going on for all their trying to hush it up. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, who's trying to hush it up? <br>
ROBBINS: Well, them over at the naval base. The secret research
establishment. <br>
DOCTOR: You seem to know a great deal about all this. <br>
ROBBINS: Well, I'm in the lifeboat crew, aren't I? We went out to look
for survivors. Only found the one lifeboat, capsized. The bottom was
all charred in a sort of pattern. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, where's this boat now? <br>
ROBBINS: Ah, the navy took it. Told us to keep our mouths shut. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, where's this naval base, then? <br>
ROBBINS: Over beyond the headland. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, well, perhaps you'd like to take me there straight away.
<br>
ROBBINS: Mister Trenchard paid me to bring you out here and take you
back. You want to go over to the naval base, then you make your own
arrangements. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you're probably perfectly right. Look, er, I wonder
whether you'd like to go and see what's happening to my young friend?
She said she was going to buy some picture postcards. <br>
(The Doctor holds up a note of the realm.) <br>
ROBBINS: I don't mind. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd go myself, only my bad leg's playing me up a bit. The
Crimea, you know. <br>
ROBBINS: I see. Crimea? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Gallipoli? El Alamein? Does it really matter? <br>
ROBBINS: I reckon not. <br>
(Robbins takes the money and leaves. The Doctor unties the little boat,
starts up the engine and chugs away.)

Captain Hart is giving dictation to his secretary, a young Wren.) <br>
HART: And I regret to inform your Lordships that our investigations
have failed to reveal any clue as to the cause of the sinkings, full
stop. The charred ship's lifeboat will be sent to our laboratory at HMS
Vernon Portsmouth for investigation and analysis. Meanwhile, we are
keeping careful watch. <br>
BLYTHE: Yes, sir? <br>
HART: Come and look at this. What on Earth? <br>
(The Doctor is steering the boat up onto the beach.) <br>
BLYTHE: Perhaps he's lost, sir. <br>
HART: This place is supposed to be top secret. People treating it like
Brighton beach. <br>
(Hart picks up a telephone.) <br>
HART: Get me the Master at Arms. Captain Hart here. I don't know
whether you've noticed but there happens to be a stray civilian
chugging into the base! Get on to it, will you? <br>

monitor, set into the wall. He switches it on and there is the episode
of the Clangers where they find a probe has landed on their planet. The
Master whistles along with the puppets. Trenchard enters.) <br>
TRENCHARD: What are you watching? <br>
MASTER: It seems to be a rather interesting extra-terrestrial life
form. <br>
TRENCHARD: Only puppets, you know? For children. <br>
MASTER: Oh. <br>
(The Master turns off the television.) <br>
TRENCHARD: Well, here's the chart you wanted. <br>

(The Master spreads the chart on the table.) <br>
MASTER: That's right. Thank you. Now. <br>
(The Master plots points on the chart.) <br>
MASTER: You know, Trenchard, a man of your efficiency is really wasted
in a job like this. <br>
TRENCHARD: Huh, bit of a comedown in a way, I suppose, but <br>
MASTER: Never mind. Once our plan succeeds people will really begin to
realise your true worth. <br>
TRENCHARD: Ah. What are you doing? <br>
MASTER: I've just been plotting the sightings of the three sinkings.
There, there and there. And it's interesting that right in the middle
of them, there's this abandoned sea fort. <br>
(The marked Fort is just off Fortress Island.) <br>
TRENCHARD: Not abandoned any more, old chap. <br>
MASTER: Really? <br>
TRENCHARD: Hart's people are going to use it as a sonar testing
station. Contractors are working on the place now. <br>

HICKMAN: Ah, forget it. <br>
CLARK: What's the matter with you? <br>
HICKMAN: I don't know. Being stuck out here, I suppose. <br>

I heard about that charred lifeboat, I had to see it. <br>
HART: Oh? Why? <br>
DOCTOR: You've inspected the boat yourself? <br>
HART: Well, of course I have. <br>
DOCTOR: Then you must have noticed the linear nature of those scorch
marks. Excuse me, my dear. May I? <br>
(The Doctor takes Blythe's shorthand pad and pencil.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now then, sit down. Now, the marks are a very definite shape, a
linear shape like this. Now, how do you account for that? <br>
(The Doctor draws a series of wavy lines on the pad.) <br>
HART: A freak affect if the ship caught fire. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but it didn't catch fire. If it had, the smoke and flames
would have been seen, wouldn't they? <br>
HART: All right then, how do you account for them? <br>
DOCTOR: A concentrated beam of heat, applied from underneath the boat
whilst it was still in the water. <br>
HART: Deliberately to sink a lifeboat? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, to make sure there were no survivors. What are these
markers here? <br>
HART: Those are the last known positions of the missing vessels so far
as we can estimate. <br>

HART: That fort is being converted for use as a testing station.
There's nobody there but a couple of maintenance workmen. <br>
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, it is right in the centre of all the trouble,
isn't it? Now if some of your naval bods could get me out there,
Captain? <br>
HART: Doctor, I have no authority to provide naval vessels for your
pleasure jaunts. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, don't you realise how important this is? <br>
HART: I realise only too well. Three ships have been sunk and many
lives have been lost. Now, if you don't mind? <br>
JO: Doctor, I think he wants us to go. <br>
HART: I suggest that you take your theories along to your own people at
UNIT and put the whole thing on an official level. <br>
DOCTOR: If Horatio Nelson had been in charge of this operation, I
hardly think that he would have waited for official instructions. <br>
HART: Yes, a pretty impulsive fellow, if one can believe the history
books. <br>

the apes that you left behind on the surface to die became man. <br>
SEA DEVIL: You know our history? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've encountered your people before. That is why I
want to prevent a conflict that can only end in your destruction. <br>
SEA DEVIL: We shall destroy man and reclaim the planet. Already we have
begun to sink his ships. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and already more ships are being sent to hunt you down. <br>
SEA DEVIL: The submarine? We have captured it. <br>
DOCTOR: You may win a few victories to begin with but eventually you're
bound to lose. <br>
SEA DEVIL: There are many thousands of our people in hibernation in
this base. We have other colonies hidden all round the world. We shall
be the victors in the war against mankind. <br>
DOCTOR: But there's no need for a war. Why can't you share the planet? <br>
SEA DEVIL: That would be impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: The depths of the sea and those areas on Earth where man cannot
live can be yours. <br>
SEA DEVIL: And man would agree to that? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a chance. Wouldn't it be better to try for a peace,
than to launch yourself into a war that you cannot possibly win? <br>
SEA DEVIL: I will consider what you have said. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me return to the humans, and I will endeavour to make a
peace for you. <br>

like to try? Come on, Jo. Now, once you're through the shaft, there's a
hatch that comes out onto the roof of this building. <br>
JO: Okay. <br>
HART: Are you ready? Hup. <br>

HART: That's it. <br>

an array of aerials, and radar and microwave dishes. Avoiding a pair of
reptiles she climbs down a ladder to the ground and runs through the

MASTER: Oh, allow me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. <br>

part of the window.) <br>
JO: (sotto) Come on, Doctor! Hurry! <br>

window.) <br>
JO: (sotto) Come on! <br>
DOCTOR: Now Jo, listen to me. In a few minutes time, I'm going to
create a diversion. Now, as soon as it starts, you try and get Hart and
the others out. <br>
JO: But what about the guards? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry about the guards. You leave them to me. Now, you
hurry back there and wait for the off. <br>
JO: Okay. <br>
(The Doctor returns to the workbench. Jo starts to run back to the main
building, but has to turn and run the other way as a reptile patrol
approaches. A little while later, the trigger mechanism is about
complete.) <br>
DOCTOR: All right? <br>
(The Doctor plugs it in to the mains. Jo is back in the main building.
A reptile enters the stores.) <br>
MASTER: Well, Doctor? <br>

through and opens the radio room door to release Hart and Walker.) <br>

goes back into the radio room.)

still.) <br>

DOCTOR: I must have had the frequency too high. I'm sorry about that.
Oh, no, I see what it is. I had the output jack in the input socket.
There. Yeah, there that should work all right now. <br>
MASTER: We shan't know for sure till we get it back to their base and
build it into their power system. <br>

MASTER: Yes, I've now finished. <br>
SEA DEVIL: Then we shall return to our base. Do you want him killed
now? <br>

hovercraft lands and Hart leads a troop of marines onto the beach and
the battle for the base begins. Despite the difference in weaponry, the
marines have the upper hand and are cutting down reptiles far more
quickly than they take casualties of their own.)

Officer looks in.) <br>
MYERS: Looks all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Look out behind you! <br>
(Myers puts five rounds rapid into the reptile.) <br>
MYERS: Would one of you gentlemen be the Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. This man is an extremely dangerous criminal, so
guard him well. Now, have you seen Captain Hart and Miss Grant? <br>
MYERS: I'm not sure, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, I'd better go and find them. <br>
MYERS: Right, I'll stay with this bloke. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, do that. And watch him! <br>

MASTER: There's been a misunderstanding here, you know. I'm not the man
that you want. There's been a mistake. <br>

the Doctor heading out to sea. <br>
WALKER: Ha ha, gone to join his friends. Gone over to the other side. <br>
BLYTHE: He seemed to be chasing another boat. <br>
JO: He must have been after the Master. <br>
WALKER: Well, be that as it may, they'll both have to take their
