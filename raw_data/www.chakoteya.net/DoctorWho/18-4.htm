<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In a pastoral setting, a single castle tower
rises from the only rocky outcrop in sight, looking like a fossilised
Thunderbird 3 to me. The two rulers of the region sit on thrones in
their dark, gothic room. A third man stands to the side. A guard
approaches and bows.) <br>
HABRIS: It is the time of selection, my lord. <br>
(A man with deeply shadowed eyes, an artificially curled beard and
wearing a golden crown replies.) <br>
ZARGO: Choose well, Habris. Let them be filled with life. <br>
(The man with no crown is less ostentatious.) <br>
AUKON: It is spirit that the Great One prizes. <br>
(The woman with the smaller crown is very imperious.) <br>
CAMILLA: Yet flesh and blood has its place. <br>
AUKON: I still look in vain for the first of the Chosen Ones. The Great
One will need new servants at the Time of Arising. Remember that,
Habris. <br>
HABRIS: My lord. <br>
(Habris leaves.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tavern]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The entire population is gathered in a large
building, sitting at tables in one half of the space. It is rough
wooden furniture and there is sawdust on the flagstone floor.) <br>
IVO: Get back. We don't want you two. <br>
(He goes over to a woman at a table.) <br>
IVO: You, get in the line. And you. <br>
(He surveys his motley selection of peasants then goes over to his wife
and son.) <br>
IVO: Go on, get back to the wall. <br>
(His son obeys and his wife smiles. Habris enters.) <br>
HABRIS: These are the best? <br>
IVO: Yes. <br>
(Habris selects two men and two women, then points to Ivo's son.) <br>
HABRIS: You, come here. <br>
IVO: He's not for the selection. <br>
HABRIS: I have to obey procedure. <br>
KARL: Why? Why do you obey them? You're not evil. <br>
HABRIS: Enough. <br>
KARL: You eat with us sometimes. I've seen you give my father wine. My
mother, my family. <br>
(Habris knocks Karl down.) <br>
HABRIS: Do you understand? <br>
IVO: It has to be done. <br>
(Karl tries to run for it.) <br>
HABRIS: Stop him! <br>
(Guards block Karl's exit.) <br>
HABRIS: I can promise nothing, you understand. <br>
(The five chosen ones are escorted out.) <br>
IVO: It's finished. Go! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROMANA: Well, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm fine. The Tardis is feeling a bit queasy. <br>
ROMANA: Really? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. So would you be if you were warping about in E-space. <br>
ROMANA: We are. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but not you personally. <br>
ROMANA: But we are personally trapped. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a low probability we can slip off home through another
CVE. <br>
ROMANA: So we are trapped. <br>
DOCTOR: Please, don't keep saying that. <br>
K9: Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Not now, K9. Not now. <br>
(Romana turns on the scanner.) <br>
ROMANA: We are. Marooned in the Exo-space time continuum. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it might be quite nice here. <br>
ROMANA: It might be. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. We won't know until we've seen the sights, met a few more
people. <br>
ROMANA: Supposing there aren't any other planets here. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, E-space isn't that small. Something's bound to turn
up. <br>
ROMANA: You are incredible. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose I am, really. I've never given it much thought. <br>
K9: Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Not now, K9. What is it? <br>
K9: There is one isolated planet at extreme limit of scanner range. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, why didn't you tell me? Is it inhabited? <br>
K9: Habitable. <br>
DOCTOR: Atmosphere? <br>
K9: Atmosphere and gravity approximate closely to Earth normal. Day
equivalent to twenty three point three Earth hours, year to three
hundred and fifty Earth days. <br>
ROMANA: How did you know? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, knowing's easy. Everyone does that ad nauseam. I just sort
of hope. <br>
(The Tardis zooms off to the planet, which is apparently orange-brown
from space.) <br>
DOCTOR: What do you make of it, K9? <br>
K9: Localised concentration of metal artefacts suggests high
technology. <br>
DOCTOR: Civilisation? <br>
K9: Low energy levels suggest primitive life forms. <br>
ROMANA: Sounds as if it's come and gone. <br>
K9: Anomalous data. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, at least there's life. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Woodland]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis lands in Burnham Beeches, a popular
Hammer Horror films location.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, very nice. <br>
ROMANA: Why here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I put us down close to K9's energy concentration. <br>
(He uses his telescope.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. There! Look. Protective castle, village dwellings huddled
like ducklings round their mother. Typical medieval scene. <br>
ROMANA: K9 said high technology. <br>
DOCTOR: Computers aren't infallible. <br>
ROMANA: Shush. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: It's awfully nice out there, K9.
Protective castle with village dwellings huddled like ducklings round
their mother. Classic medieval scene. You'd better stay here. Come on,
K9. Someone's got to stay on guard, and you can compute a reverse
transition from existing data. You love doing that, eh? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the console room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Adric comes through an inner door.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Bye, bye, K9. <br>
(K9 plugs himself into the console.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: On the other hand, they may have opted
deliberately for a semi-rural culture. It's a mistake to judge by
appearances. Hello. <br>
(The man puts his hands over his ears, then eyes and mouth.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. Maybe you can help us? <br>
(The man takes his shovel and runs.) <br>
DOCTOR: We were wondering if. Should have asked him the name of his
tailor. <br>
ROMANA: You mustn't judge by appearances, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
ROMANA: He's probably the Astronomer Royal. </font></p>

IVO: Get a move on, you lot, or you'll be late! You. (to Habris)
Increase the food allowances, you'd get better results. They're too
weak to work harder. <br>
HABRIS: I am the one who has to report to the Tower. <br>
IVO: You're the one who has to tell them about poor harvests. <br>
HABRIS: I'll see what I can do. <br>
IVO: Huh. That's what you said about my son. <br>
HABRIS: When there's news, I'll tell you. <br>
IVO: News? When is there ever news? <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
(Ivo makes the ears, eyes, mouth gesture and bows. The Doctor tries to
copy him.) <br>
IVO: You're not from the village. <br>
HABRIS: Or the Tower. <br>
ROMANA: That's right. <br>
IVO: It isn't possible. There's nowhere else. How can you be here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well <br>
HABRIS: My lord. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, please, just the Doctor will do. This is Romana. <br>
HABRIS: My lord, how may I serve you? <br>
DOCTOR: How may you serve me? Well. <br>
HABRIS: Your lord's command. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. We were just wondering if there were any other
scientists <br>
IVO: Scientists? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, scientists. You know, witch-wiggler, wangateur. Fortune
teller? Mundunugu? <br>
IVO: Ah! Oh, such things are forbidden. We know nothing of them here. <br>
HABRIS: If my lord will excuse me, my duties. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(Habris leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: I take it you don't get many strangers here. <br>
IVO: Strangers? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, visitors. Foreign devils. You know, people you don't know.
<br>
IVO: Everyone here is known. <br>
ROMANA: Well, what about people from the next village, or the nearest
town? <br>
IVO: There is only the village and the Tower, nowhere else. <br>
DOCTOR: Who lives in this Tower of your? <br>
IVO: Why do you ask what everyone must know? Are you sent to test me? I
am Ivo, head man of this village like my father before me and his
father before him. The Lords know I'm loyal. <br>
DOCTOR: Please, don't shout. Splendid, I'm sure. So you serve the
Lords, but what do the Lords do for you? <br>
IVO: They protect us from the Wasting. <br>
DOCTOR: Did you say the Wasting? <br>
IVO: I have work to do. <br>
ROMANA: Come on, Doctor. This is silly. <br>
(Ivo starts tidying up the chairs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Ivo. These Lords of yours, how long have they
ruled over you? <br>
IVO: Forever. <br>
DOCTOR: Really. As long as that? Well, that's a long time. <br>
(The Doctor and Romana leave. Ivo shuts the door behind them, goes to a
box on the wall and takes out a walkie-talkie.) <br>
IVO: Kalmar. Kalmar, can you hear me? (burble) Two strangers, here, in
the village. (burble burble) That's right, strangers. They were asking
about scientists. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Adric enters the console room from inside the
Tardis and makes straight for the outside door.) <br>
K9: Halt! Your presence here is unauthorised. Explain. <br>
ADRIC: You remember me, K9. Adric. <br>
K9: Immature humanoid. Non-hostile. <br>
(K9 sucks his laser in.) <br>
ADRIC: That's better. <br>
K9: Your presence is still unauthorised. Explain. <br>
ADRIC: I stowed away. <br>
K9: Stowed what away? <br>
ADRIC: Myself. I'm a stowaway. <br>
K9: Stowaway. One who hides in a ship to obtain free passage. <br>
ADRIC: I thought I'd join up with the Doctor and see the universe.
Where are we? <br>
K9: An unidentified planet in what is referred to as E-space. <br>
ADRIC: What space? <br>
K9: E-space, to distinguish it from the larger N-space of our own
origin. <br>
ADRIC: Oh, I see. That problem again. <br>
K9: These concepts are unknown to me. Doctor master will explain. <br>
ADRIC: Where is he? <br>
K9: Doctor and mistress Romana have gone in search of
astro-navigational data. When I have finished my calculations <br>
ADRIC: You just stay here and get back to your sums and I'll go and
find them. <br>
K9: Stop! Your expedition is dangerous and unnecessary. <br>
ADRIC: Listen, K9, I'm a stowaway. I shouldn't be here at all. <br>
K9: Correct. <br>
ADRIC: Then the sooner I leave, the better. <br>
K9: The conclusion is logical. <br>
(The doors open.) <br>
ADRIC: Gotcha. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROMANA: How much further are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: These people are more complicated than you think, you know.
Only to the next village. <br>
ROMANA: There isn't another village. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
ROMANA: What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just bats. They come out at night, you know. What do you
mean, there isn't another village. Of course there's another village.
There's got to be another village. Just a minute. Maybe you're right.
K9's orbital scan. The settlement was the only thing to show up on it. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
ROMANA: Look. <br>
(They are surrounded by cloaked figures, who move in menacingly.) <br>
ROMANA: Say something. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is Romana. Er, we were just
passing your charming planet and we thought we'd just, er, well, drop
in. Look, I know this may seem a silly sort of question, but we were
wondering if you could tell us something about E-space. E-space?
Perhaps not. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ZARGO: What do you mean, vanished? <br>
HABRIS: We scoured the village. <br>
ZARGO: Then the rebels must have them. <br>
CAMILLA: Strangers at a time like this. Why did you not seize them when
they first appeared? <br>
HABRIS: I had no orders, my lady, and there was something about them.
They were no peasants, that I swear. They were Lords. <br>
ZARGO: We are your Lords, Habris. There are no others. <br>
HABRIS: Forgive me. <br>
ZARGO: More patrols immediately. They must be found. <br>
HABRIS: At once, my lord. <br>
AUKON: Wait. <br>
HABRIS: Master? <br>
AUKON: I will discover the whereabouts of these strangers. Spare your
guards. <br>
ZARGO: But strangers, Aukon. <br>
AUKON: If they are still on this planet, my servants will find them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Rebel's cave]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (It is getting darker as the Doctor and Romana are
escorted along a well-trodden path, past some remains of broken tech
and into a cave. Inside, an old man stands as they enter. He has been
operating a bank of equipment.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's quite a technocotheca you've got here. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, what's a technocotheca? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I think it's some sort of museum. <br>
ROMANA: Oh. <br>
VEROS: Look at their faces. Look at their clothes. They're strangers. <br>
TARAK: We found them in the forest. He calls himself Doctor. <br>
KALMAR: Doctor? That's a word I've seen in the old records. It's a
title used by scientists. Are you a scientist, Doctor, like me? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've dabbled a bit. <br>
TARAK: He was asking about scientists in the Centre. All right, it's
time for some answers. <br>
DOCTOR: What, do you mean who are we, where do we come from that sort
of thing? <br>
TARAK: It'll do for a start. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, let's not talk about us. This looks much more
interesting. <br>
(The Doctor sits at the bank of equipment.) <br>
DOCTOR: I see you've got some of it working. <br>
KALMAR: We have a generator. It gives us power for air, light and heat,
and the communicators. <br>
TARAK: But no weapons, eh, Kalmar. <br>
KALMAR: When we have rediscovered basic scientific principles, we shall
be able to make weapons of our own. But it takes time. <br>
TARAK: How many of us have lived and died because everything takes
time. <br>
ROMANA: How long have things been like this? <br>
KALMAR: Forever. The Lords rule in the Tower, the peasants toil in the
fields. Nothing has changed in a thousand years. <br>
TARAK: But it will change when we overthrow the Lords. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Isn't that a bit dangerous? I mean, a chap in the village
told me the Lords protected you from the Wasting. <br>
KALMAR: You know about the Wasting? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, only by hearsay. What is the Wasting? <br>
TARAK: The Wasting? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
TARAK: The Wasting is <br>

cooking pot when Adric sneaks in. He hides behind a pillar and tries to
reach out for a piece of bread. She grabs his arm.) <br>
MARTA: Got you! Who are you? How did you come here? <br>
ADRIC: Oh, I walked. <br>
MARTA: I don't know you. <br>
ADRIC: Well, I don't know you, either. <br>
MARTA: But that's not possible. <br>
ADRIC: I'm looking for two friends of mine. I don't suppose you've seen
them, have you? Tall man with curly hair and a silly scarf. There'll be
a girl with him. <br>
MARTA: There were two strangers here earlier, a lord and a lady. <br>
ADRIC: Any idea where they could be? <br>
MARTA: They went to the Tower. <br>
(Ivo grabs Adric from behind.) <br>
IVO: What are you doing with my bread? Who are you? <br>
MARTA: He's looking for the two strangers. <br>
IVO: Let him look somewhere else, then. <br>
MARTA: No, you can't let him go out now. It's not safe. Let him stay
the night at least. Maybe his friends will come for him. <br>
IVO: And what if someone from the Tower comes, eh? <br>
MARTA: What, now? That's hardly likely. Here, boy, you take this. <br>
(Marta helps Adric put on a rough local style jacket.) <br>
MARTA: It belonged to my son. <br>
ADRIC: Whatever you say. Well, if I'm staying. <br>
(Adric helps himself to a bowl of stew.) <br>
ADRIC: You wouldn't have any cheese, would you? <br>
MARTA: Cheese? <br>
ADRIC: Never mind. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: How long ago was that? <br>
TARAK: Years ago. Some of us were on the run from Zargo and his men. We
escaped into the wasteland and discovered this, all kinds of wonderful
things just thrown about, half hidden. There was even food, mountains
of it. <br>
KALMAR: Some of us could still read. It's forbidden, but the knowledge
was passed on in secret. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Reading forbidden? <br>
KALMAR: All science, all knowledge is forbidden by the Lords. The
penalty for knowledge is death. <br>
ROMANA: No schools of any kind? <br>
KALMAR: Children start in the fields as soon as they can walk, stay
there till they grow up, grow old and die. <br>
TARAK: Those that escape the selection. <br>
ROMANA: What's the selection? <br>
TARAK: Some are taken to the Tower to serve the Lords. <br>
KALMAR: So they say. <br>
ROMANA: I see you've got a lot to rebel against. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a minute. Got it. Ha, ha! <br>
(A monitor lights up green.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now we'll find out something. I <br>
(The monitor goes blank again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, must have been out of guarantee. Instruction manual would
be helpful. <br>
ROMANA: Nonsense, it's just a standard Earth-type databank. I'll have
to crack the entry code, but. Earth type! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, lovely old technology. Back on twentieth century Earth, the
engineers used to just <br>

Ships manifest and cargo. 2. Flight plan from Earth. 3. Crew of
exploration. 4. Vessel Hydrax en route from Earth destination Beta Two

DOCTOR: Definitely an Earth device. <br>
ROMANA: Ship's manifest and cargo, flight plan from Earth. So it is
Earth. Crew of exploration vessel Hydrax en route from Earth
destination Beta Two in the Perugellis sector. <br>
DOCTOR: Instead of which they finish up here. <br>
ROMANA: Hmm, they must have gone through a CVE as well. Ship's
officers, Captain Miles Sharkey, Navigational officer Lauren MacMillan,
Science officer Anthony O'Connor. Identification pictures follow. It's
still legible. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, not bad after a thousand years in memory. <br>
(And up come the pictures.) <br>
TARAK: Those faces! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, long since dead. <br>
TARAK: I was a Tower guard before I joined Kalmar. I saw them every
day. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
TARAK: But, as you say, it can't be. <br>
DOCTOR: Who did you see every day? <br>
TARAK: The three who rule. The King, his Queen. <br>
DOCTOR: That's two. <br>
TARAK: And Aukon, the councillor. No, I'm sorry, I see their faces
everywhere. If you knew these people, Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think it's time we got to know them, don't you, Romana?
<br>
VEROS: They're supposed to be our prisoners, or have you forgotten
that? <br>
KALMAR: No. While I lead, I will make the decision. They are free to
go. <br>

DOCTOR: Night must fall, Romana, even in E-space. <br>
ROMANA: Doesn't feel natural. There's that noise again. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind. It's bats. Quite harmless. <br>
(A roost of bats fly at them. One bites the Doctor on the neck. His
blood is apparently blue.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! Well, in theory. That one was a bit carnivorous. <br>
ROMANA: Do you mind if we get a move on? <br>

ROMANA: What windows? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and then there's the general architectural style. Would
you call it rococo? <br>
ROMANA: No, I wouldn't. <br>

CAMILLA: We know everything here. <br>
DOCTOR: Gosh. <br>
ZARGO: What we do not know is why you are here. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, er, well, we were just admiring your tower. Weren't we
admiring the tower? <br>
CAMILLA: It was built many generations ago, before living memory. <br>
ZARGO: You are space travellers? <br>
ROMANA: Doesn't that surprise you? <br>
ZARGO: Nothing surprises us. A little refreshment? <br>
(Camilla and Zargo gesture towards a table that Aukon has loaded with
fresh food. Camilla hands the Doctor and Romana glasses of wine.) <br>
ZARGO: May you both enjoy your visit. <br>
(Camilla holds up a tray of sliced salami or some similar meat product.
The Doctor and Romana both shake their heads.) <br>
CAMILLA: As we will enjoy having you. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you certainly do very well for yourselves here. <br>
ZARGO: We struggle to retain some remnants of civilisation. On an
isolated, primitive planet like this, it isn't easy. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, indeed. Still, you do better than the peasants. Bull's
blood, I think. <br>
CAMILLA: The peasants are simple folk. Richer fare would only distress
them. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite right. Probably give them indigestion. There's nothing
worse than a peasant with indigestion. Makes them quite rebellious. I
hear you've been having trouble that way. <br>
CAMILLA: There are always a few ungrateful ones who do not appreciate
all that we do for them. <br>
ROMANA: And what do you do for them, apart from saving them from
gluttony? <br>
ZARGO: We protect them. <br>

DOCTOR: Sorry. Are you all right? <br>

ROMANA: Yes, it's nothing. It's a tiny cut. <br>

ZARGO: Doctor, you still have not told us why you came here. <br>
ROMANA: Bad luck, mostly. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we were blown off-course. <br>
ROMANA: A universe off-course. <br>
DOCTOR: We were hoping you'd tell us how you got here, or better still,
how to get back. <br>
ZARGO: I fear we cannot help you. Our records say we came from some
distant planet. A freak accident. <br>
CAMILLA: We can never return home. Our technology is lost. <br>

ADRIC: And they become guards? <br>
MARTA: A few. But most of them, no. Yesterday they took our son. <br>

DOCTOR: No. What is, is wrong. Look, societies develop in varying ways.
Yours just seems to be sinking back into some sort of primitivism.
Wouldn't you say so? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, yes. In terms of applied socioenergetics, it's losing its
grip on level two development. <br>
DOCTOR: On level two? <br>
ROMANA: A society that evolve backwards must be subject to some even
more powerful force restraining it. <br>
DOCTOR: An even more powerful force? <br>
ZARGO: How very mysterious. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, mysterious or not, those rebels seem to think the power
emanates from you. <br>
CAMILLA: They flatter us. <br>
ZARGO: In any society there is bound to be a division. The rulers and
the ruled. <br>

ROMANA: No, I'd say a sociopathetic abscess. <br>

ZARGO: A metaphor. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. It's just odd, you see, that he should mention that,
because Romana and I have just been at your ship's old manifest and I
can't remember what the ship was called but Romana might be able to
remember. What was it called, Romana? <br>

Let's sit down. <br>
(The Doctor tries Camilla's throne, then Zargo's.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, this is much more comfortable. What were those Hydrax
officers called? <br>
ROMANA: Captain Miles Sharkey, Navigation Officer Lauren MacMillan,
Science Officer Anthony O'Connor. <br>
DOCTOR: That's very good. Have you ever heard of the Brothers Grimm? <br>
ROMANA: This is no time for fairy tales. <br>
DOCTOR: They also discovered the Law of Consonantal Shift. How language
changes over the years. <br>
ROMANA: You mean the hard sounds softening, B's becoming V's and so on.
<br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
ROMANA: Camilla, Aukon and Zargo. Wait a minute. Sharkey, Zharkey,
Zarkey, Zar, Zargo. The same name passed down through generations. <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. And MacMillan becomes? <br>
ROMANA: Camilla. <br>
DOCTOR: And O'Connor becomes? <br>
ROMANA: Aukon. The descendants of the original ship's officers. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. And this is the original ship. The pilot here, co-pilot
there. No, no, no, pilot there, co-pilot here. Instrument banks there,
control panels there. <br>
ROMANA: You mean this is the Hydrax, the explorer ship? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Do you fancy exploring it? <br>

here he is. The first of the Chosen Ones, at last. <br>
ZARGO: But he is an alien. He must have come with the two strangers. <br>
CAMILLA: The Chosen Ones were to be from amongst the peasants. <br>
AUKON: We have bred dullness, conformity, obedience into those clods
for twenty generations. Unfortunately, we have also bred out just those
qualities we need for other purposes. <br>
ZARGO: This disturbs me, Aukon. <br>
CAMILLA: We have been talking to this Doctor and his companion. <br>
ZARGO: The Doctor's mind is powerful, but he is dangerous. He must die.
<br>
AUKON: Not before I have questioned him. <br>
ZARGO: I say he is dangerous and must die. The boy too. We need no
aliens to join us. Let him feed the Great One with his blood. <br>
(Adric stares blankly ahead as Zargo waves his dagger in front of his

AUKON: The boy is still young. His mind is strong, clear, but
malleable. We can make of him what we wish. <br>
CAMILLA: Aukon is right. What does it matter where he comes from? Once
he is initiated, he is ours. We must increase our numbers as the Great

DOCTOR: Got it! Vampire army. Phew, listen to this, K9. So powerful
were the bodies of these great creatures, and so fiercely did they
cling to life, that they were impossible to kill, save by the use of
bow ships. Bow ships? What are bow ships? <br>
K9: Bow ships, unknown. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind. Yet slain they all were, and to the last one, by
the Lords of Time. The Lords of Time destroying them utterly. Well,
that's good news. However, when the bodies were counted (gasp) I knew
it. Just like the legend said. When the bodies were counted, the King
Vampire, mightiest and most malevolent of all, had vanished, even to
his shadow, from time and space. Until now. <br>

comes upon this enemy of our people and of all living things, shall use

DOCTOR: Got it. Energy weapons were useless because the monsters
absorbed and transmuted the energy using it to become stronger.
Therefore Rassilon ordered the construction of bow ships. Ah. Swift
vessels that fired a mighty bold of steel that transfixed the monsters
through the heart. For only if his heart be utterly destroyed will a
vampire die. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Come on. <br>
(Even kicking the console makes no difference.) <br>
DOCTOR: One to go. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Resting place]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> AUKON: O Great One, hear us. We celebrate your
Arising with the sacrifice of a Time Lord, one of the race of your
enemies. Drink her soul and grow strong. <br>
(Bats fly in from outside.) <br>
AUKON: Come, O servants of the Great One, come. Drink the blood of the
sacrifice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Flight deck 3]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Come on. Come on! What happened to all
that Earth craftsmanship, eh? Just because you've been laid up for a
thousand years. <br>
(He punches the console and it starts humming.) <br>
DOCTOR: A scintilla of power left in the energy cells, a few drops of
fuel. Oh, lovely Earth craftsmanship. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[State room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (K9 is on Zargo's throne.) <br>
K9: Leave at once. Evacuate the Tower. Evacuate. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Flight deck 3]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: That should do it. Short trip, quick flip.
Time to be going, Doctor. <br>
(The rebels rush out of the State room, the first bat lands on Romana's
white throat, and the Doctor rushes down the ladders.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Resting place]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Everywhere starts to shake, and the bat flies off
leaving two little puncture marks on Romana's neck. The three turn
round to look at the spaceship's exhaust port behind them.) <br>
AUKON: The ship! <br>
ZARGO: What's happening? <br>
AUKON: No! <br>
(Romana wakes and Adric helps her away. The Doctor gets out of another
exhaust port as one third of the rocket nose cone breaks off, fires its
engine and lifts off, and runs over to Adric and Romana.) <br>
DOCTOR: Romana! Right, time for me to tell you what happened. <br>
ROMANA: You sent the scout ship on a little trip. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Yes. <br>
(Meanwhile, the crust is broken.) <br>
AUKON: He rises! See, the Great One rises! <br>
(A giant claw comes out of the ground as the little scout ship reaches
the top of its trajectory and starts to turn.) <br>
AUKON: He comes! The Great One comes! <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, don't worry. Have you ever heard the expression
what goes up must come down? <br>
ADRIC: No. <br>
DOCTOR: I wish I hadn't. <br>
(The scout ship starts its powered descent.) <br>
AUKON: No! No! <br>
DOCTOR: Get down! Get down! <br>
(The pointed little ship pierces the ground by the giant claw. There is
an inhuman gurgling and the claw goes back down again as the heartbeat
stops. <br>
The Three are not pleased, and advance on the Doctor, canines bared.
They back the Doctor into a corner, then start aging in front of his
eyes before finally crumbling to skeletons.) <br>
DOCTOR: There was never really anything to worry about. Their time was
up. Well done. Well done, well done, well done. <br>
ADRIC: So that's what happens to vampires when they die. <br>
ROMANA: Glad you didn't join them? <br>
ADRIC: I'm sorry about that. It was just a bluff. It just so happens I
was trying to rescue you. <br>
ROMANA: But you didn't, did you. <br>
(Ivo, Kalmar and Veros enter with K9.) <br>
IVO: Well, we've dealt with the Tower, Doctor. Now, what about this
monster? <br>
(The Doctor points at the scout ship sticking out of the still ground.)
<br>
KALMAR: What did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I just fired off one of the rocket ships, you see, and I
arranged the controls so that it went straight up <br>
ROMANA: And came straight down again. <br>
IVO: But what about the lords, Zargo and the others? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Well, they just went to pieces. <br>
(They go over to the skeletons.) <br>
KALMAR: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
KALMAR: As once scientist to another, congratulations. <br>
DOCTOR: It was nothing. <br>
IVO: There is one thing, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
IVO: I feel I really must apologise for the things I said about K9. <br>
DOCTOR: Go on, then. <br>
(Ivo does a double take, then kneels by K9.) <br>
IVO: Well done, dog. <br>
K9: Your thanks are recorded. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Rebel's cave]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: There, that should do it. <br>
(The scanner dies. He hits it.) <br>
DOCTOR: There, that should do it. Well, Kalmar, there's all the
knowledge you'll need in there. Use it well, and if that's what you
want, you can be a high technological society in no time. <br>
KALMAR: We'll do our best, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good. <br>
KALMAR: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
KALMAR: If we can get the main ship working <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? Inside, you two. We just have to get on with this. <br>
KALMAR: Is there any way out of this E-space? Perhaps one day we can
get back to Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I really don't know. You see, we came here by accident,
but you were brought here by the Great Vampire's brain and his secret
died with him. Kalmar, such good luck. <br>
KALMAR: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: And you, young man, you're going straight home. <br>
(The Doctor follows Romana and Adric into the Tardis. <br>
ADRIC [OC]: But Doctor <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: You're going straight back to the Starliner. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) </font> </p>
