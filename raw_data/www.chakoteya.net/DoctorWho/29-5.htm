for hybridisation. <br>
(The Doctor sneaks away behind some equipment. The pigmen take the
others.) <br>
MARTHA: Leave me alone! Don't you dare! <br>
(Happy Days are Here Again starts playing.) <br>
SEC: What is that sound? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, now, that would be me. <br>
(He puts the radio down by a Bunsen burner and walks up to Sec.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. Surprise. Boo. Et cetera. <br>
SEC: Doctor. <br>
DALEK: The enemy of the Daleks. <br>
DALEK 3: Exterminate. <br>
SEC: Wait! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, then. A new form of Dalek. Fascinating and very clever. <br>
SEC: The Cult of Skaro escaped your slaughter. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you end up in 1930? <br>
SEC: Emergency temporal shift. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that must have roasted up your power cells, huh? Time was,
four Daleks could have conquered the world, but instead you're skulking
away, hidden in the dark, experimenting. All of which results in you. <br>
SEC: I am Dalek in human form. <br>
DOCTOR: What does it feel like? You can talk to me, Dalek Sec. It is
Dalek Sec, isn't it? That's your name? You've got a name and a mind of
your own. Tell me what you're thinking right now. <br>
SEC: I feel humanity. <br>
(Sec turns away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good. That's good. <br>
SEC: I feel everything we wanted from mankind, which is ambition,
hatred, aggression and war. Such a genius for war. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's not what humanity means. <br>
SEC: I think it does. At heart, this species is so very Dalek. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, so what have you achieved then, with this Final
Experiment, eh? Nothing! Because I can show you what you're missing
with this thing. A simple little radio. <br>
DALEK 3: What is the purpose of that device? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, exactly. It plays music. What's the point of that? Oh,
with music, you can dance to it, sing with it, fall in love to it.
Unless you're a Dalek of course. Then it's all just noise. <br>
(The Doctor aims his sonic screwdriver at the little radio. It emits a
shriek that hurts Sec and the Daleks, and the pigmen.) <br>
DOCTOR: Run! <br>
(The prisoners escape and the Doctor follows them) <br>
DALEK: Protect the hybrid! <br>
DALEKS: Protect. Protect. Protect. <br>
(The humans run back down the sewers. Laszlo stays with the pigmen.) <br>
DALEK: Report status. <br>
SEC: Pain. Pain of the flesh, like no other Dalek has felt for
thousands of years. <br>
DALEK 1: The Doctor has escaped. <br>
SEC: Then find him. Find him. <br>
DALEK 1: Find the Doctor. The prisoners must be recaptured.

(The Doctor leads the group to where Tallulah is standing, lost.) <br>
DOCTOR: And you, Tallulah! Run! <br>
TALLULAH: What's happened to Laszlo? <br>
(Martha drags Tallulah along. Laszlo hangs back as the pigmen and
Daleks search the sewers. The Doctor leads the group to the ladder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on! Everyone up! Come on! <br>
(In the laboratory, Sec picks up the broken radio and strokes its
Bakelite surface.) <br>
DALEK 1: They have ascended. Return to base. <br>
(The pigmen leave.) <br>
DALEK 1: Request information. What is your opinion of Dalek Sec? <br>
DALEK 3: We were created to follow him. <br>
DALEK 1: But you have doubts. <br>
(The Daleks check that they cannot be overheard.) <br>
DALEK 3: Affirmative.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOLOMON: These Daleks, they sound like the stuff of
nightmares. And they want to breed? <br>
DOCTOR: They're splicing themselves onto human bodies, and if I'm
right, they've got a farm of breeding stock right here in Hooverville.
You've got to get everyone out. <br>
SOLOMON: Hooverville's the lowest place a man can fall. There's nowhere
else to go. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Solomon. You've got to scatter. Go anywhere. Down to
the railroads, travel across state. Just get out of New York. <br>
SOLOMON: There's got to be a way to reason with these things. <br>
MARTHA: There's not a chance. <br>
FRANK: You ain't seen them, boss. <br>
DOCTOR: Daleks are bad enough at anytime, but right now they're
vulnerable. That makes them more dangerous than ever. <br>
(One of the lookouts hears a grunt. He uses a pair of binoculars and
finally spots a pigman looks from behind a tree. He blows his whistle
and runs as the pigmen break cover.) <br>
SENTRY: They're coming! They're coming! <br>
SOLOMON: A sentry. He must have seen something. <br>
SENTRY: They're here! I've seen them! Monsters! They're monsters! <br>
DOCTOR: It's started. <br>
SOLOMON: We're under attack! Everyone to arms! <br>
(Rifles are handed out.) <br>
FRANK: I'm ready, boss, but all of you, find a weapon! Use anything. <br>
(Some people run away.) <br>
SOLOMON: Come back! We've got to stick together! It's not safe out
there! Come back! <br>
(The pigmen get into the camp and start grabbing victims.) <br>
MARTHA: We need to get out of the park. <br>
DOCTOR: We can't. They're on all sides. They're driving everyone back
towards us. <br>
TALLULAH: We're trapped. <br>
SOLOMON: Then we stand together. Gather round. Everybody come to me.
You there, Jethro, Harry, Seamus, stay together. <br>
(The armed men form a circle around the women, by the campfire.) <br>
SOLOMON: They can't take all of us. <br>
(The shooting starts.) <br>
MARTHA: If we can just hold them off till daylight. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Martha, they're just the foot soldiers. <br>
MARTHA: Oh, my God. <br>
(A Dalek comes flying towards them. Number 3 according to its logo.) <br>
SOLOMON: What in this world is? <br>
SENTRY: It's the devil. A devil in the sky. God save us all. It's
damnation. <br>
FRANK: Oh yeah? We'll see about that! <br>
(Frank fires his shotgun at the Dalek. The shot bounces off with a
clang.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's not going to work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SEC: Establish visual contact. <br>
(The view from Dalek 3's eyestalk comes up on a holo-screen.) <br>
SEC: Commence the attack. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTHA: There's more than one of them. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Solomon puts down his rifle.) <br>
SOLOMON: Right. See, I've just discovered this past day, God's universe
is a thousand times the size I thought it was. And that scares me. Oh
yeah, terrifies me right down to the bone. But surely it's got to give
me hope.
Hope that maybe together we can make a better tomorrow. So, I beg you
now, if you have any compassion in your hearts, then you'll meet with
us and stop this fight. Well? What do you say? <br>
DALEK 3: Exterminate. <br>
(Solomon dies screaming in a burst of green energy. Sec gasps at the
sight of Solomon's pain, and the Dalek in the lab looks at him.) <br>
FRANK: No! Solomon! <br>
MARTHA: They killed him. They just shot him on the spot. <br>
DOCTOR: Daleks. All right, so it's my turn! Then kill me! Kill me if
it'll stop you attacking these people! <br>
DALEK 3: I will be the destroyer of our greatest enemy. <br>
DOCTOR: Then do it! Do it! Just do it! Do it! <br>

TALLULAH: So what about us? What do we do now? <br>
MARTHA: The Doctor gave me this. He must have had a reason. <br>

must want me to go somewhere but, what am I supposed to do?

DOCTOR: Those people were defenceless! You only wanted me, but no, that
wasn't enough for you. You had to start killing, because that's the
only thing a Dalek's good for. <br>
SEC: The deaths were wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry? <br>
SEC: That man, their leader, Solomon. He showed courage. <br>
DOCTOR: And that's good? <br>
SEC: That's excellent. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it me or are you just becoming a little bit more human? <br>
SEC: You are the last of your kind, and now I am the first of mine. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you want me for? <br>
SEC: We tried everything to survive when we found ourselves stranded in
this ignorant age. First we tried growing new Dalek embryos, but their
flesh was too weak. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I found one of your experiments. Just left to die out
there in the dark. <br>
SEC: It forced us to conclude what is the greatest resource of this
planet. Its people. <br>
(Sec throws a breaker switch and lights up the whole place. Floating
above them are hundreds of covered bodies on stretchers. Sec brings one
down for inspection.) <br>
SEC: We stole them. We stole human beings for our purpose. Look inside.
<br>
(The Doctor uncovers a man's face.) <br>
SEC: This is the true extent of the Final Experiment. <br>
DOCTOR: Is he dead? <br>
SEC: Near death, with his mind wiped, ready to be filled with new
ideas. <br>
DOCTOR: Dalek ideas. <br>
SEC: The Human Dalek race. <br>
DOCTOR: All of these people. How many? <br>
SEC: We have caverns beyond this storing more than a thousand. <br>
DOCTOR: Is there any way to restore them? Make them human again? <br>
SEC: Everything they were has been lost. <br>
DOCTOR: So they're like shells. You've got empty human beings ready to
be converted. That's going to take a hell of a lot of power. This
planet hasn't even split the atom yet. How're you going to do it? <br>
SEC: Open the conductor plan.

you jobs all over town? <br>
FRANK: Yeah. He could find a profit anywhere. <br>
MARTHA: But where, though? What sort of things? <br>
FRANK: You name it. We're all so desperate for work, you just hoped
Diagoras would pick you for something good. Building work, that pays
the best. <br>
MARTHA: But what sort of building work? <br>
FRANK: Mainly building that. <br>

DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Empire State Building. We're right
underneath that. I worked that out already, thanks. But what, you've
hijacked the whole building? <br>
SEC: We needed an energy conductor. <br>
DOCTOR: What for? <br>
SEC: I am the genetic template. My altered DNA was to be administered
to each human body. A strong enough blast of gamma radiation can splice
the Dalek and human genetic codes, and waken each body from its sleep. <br>
DOCTOR: Gamma radiation? What are you. Oh, the sun. You're using the
sun. <br>
SEC: Soon the greatest solar flare for a thousand years will hit the
Earth. Gamma radiation will be drawn to the energy conductor and when
it strikes <br>
DOCTOR: The army wakes. I still don't know what you need me for. <br>
SEC: Your genius. Consider a pure Dalek, intelligent but emotionless. <br>
DOCTOR: Removing the emotions makes you stronger. That's what your
creator thought, all those years ago. <br>
SEC: He was wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: He was what? <br>
SEC: It makes us lesser than our enemies. We must return to the flesh,
and also the heart. <br>
DOCTOR: But you wouldn't be the supreme beings anymore. <br>
SEC: And that is good. <br>
DALEK 2: That is incorrect. <br>
DALEK 3: Daleks are supreme. <br>
SEC: No, not anymore. <br>
DALEK 3: But that is our purpose. <br>
SEC: Then our purpose is wrong. Where has our quest for supremacy led
us? To this. Hiding in the sewers on a primitive world, just four of us
left. If we do not change now then we deserve extinction. <br>
DOCTOR: So you want to change everything that makes a Dalek a Dalek. <br>
SEC: If you can help me.
