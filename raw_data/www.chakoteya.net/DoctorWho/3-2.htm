</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(On the plain outside the ancient city of Troy, two
men are fighting.) <br>
HECTOR: Achilles! <br>
ACHILLES: Over here, stable keeper. Barbarian horse worshipper! <br>
HECTOR: Out of breath so soon, my light-foot princeling? Your friend
Petrocolus fled me further, and made better sport! <br>
ACHILLES: Murderer! Petrocolus was a boy. <br>
HECTOR: A boy? Well he died like a dog, whimpering after his master
Achilles! How! Let me send you to him where he waits in Hades. Let me
throw the dog a bone or two! <br>
(Achilles lunges at Hector, who easily parries the thrust. They circle
round each other warily.) <br>
HECTOR: What? So anxious to be gone? Well, I would not keep you for the
world. <br>
ACHILLES: Your bones would be the meatier, Trojan. Though meat a trifle
rough at that. Well, all's one. They will whiten well enough in the
sun! <br>
(Enraged, Achilles attacks again, and Hector counters every blow.
Hector seems to be gaining the upper hand when Achilles turns and
dodges out of reach, running past and ignoring the blue police box
which has no place in the middle of a Trojan plain. Hector follows,
calling after him.) <br>
HECTOR: Run, Achilles! Run! Run a little more, before you die!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VICKI: What sort of people are they, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm not sure, my child. You'll notice they're wearing
Grecian costumes. <br>
VICKI: They don't seem to have noticed us. <br>
STEVEN: That's hardly surprising in the circumstances. Why do you
suppose they're fighting? <br>
DOCTOR: I haven't the remotest idea, my boy. No doubt their reasons
will be entirely adequate. Yes, I think I perhaps I'd better go and ask
them where we are. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, be careful! They look terribly fierce. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, what nonsense. If you take notice of them, I think they're
doing more talking than they are fighting. I think I'd better go and
ask them where we are. <br>
VICKI: Doctor, you can't! You know if you go out there by yourself
you'll g <br>
DOCTOR: Now you stay here, my dear, and look after that ankle. <br>
STEVEN: Wouldn't it be better if I went? <br>
DOCTOR: Not at all, young man. You stay here and keep an eye on Vicki.
Besides, I don't think your present humour is fitting for the occasion.
You know, I don't think they'd appreciate your kind of sarcasm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Plain outside Troy]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACHILLES: The gods of my people, Hector, are not
lightly mocked. They are terrible! And Troy itself is doomed to fall at
their bidding, even as you are. You cannot stand against them. <br>
HECTOR: You pretend that old Father Zeus will descend to Earth and take
Troy for you. I guarantee to trim his beard for him if he dare attempt
it! <br>
(thunder) <br>
ACHILLES: Beware the voice of Zeus, Hector. Beware the anger of
Olympus. <br>
HECTOR: Oh, I do not fear the thunder, you superstitious, dark-dodging
decadent! Hear me, Zeus! Accept from me the promised life of your
cringing servant Achilles! Or else, I challenge you. Descend to Earth
and save him! <br>
(Hector lunges at Achilles as the Doctor emerges from the Tardis, and
Hector falls to his knees, amazed.) <br>
HECTOR: Zeus! Forgive me. <br>
(With Hector distracted, Achilles runs him through with his sword.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stop! You must not kick a man when he is down. You have killed
this poor fellow! <br>
ACHILLES: Oh, but in your name. <br>
DOCTOR: In my name, indeed! Get up! Get up, I tell you! This is
terrible. <br>
ACHILLES: If Zeus bids me to rise. <br>
DOCTOR: What is this? What is it you take me for? <br>
ACHILLES: The Father of the Gods and ruler of the world. <br>
DOCTOR: What! Do you really? And who might you be, may I ask? <br>
ACHILLES: Achilles. Mightiest of warriors, greatest in battle, humblest
of your servants. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if I may say so, you're not very humble, are you? Yes, I
think I know you. Yes. And this friend of yours must be <br>
ACHILLES: Hector, Prince of Troy. Sent to Hades for blasphemy against
the gods of Greece. <br>
DOCTOR: Blasphemy? I'm sure he didn't mean it. <br>
ACHILLES: He threatened to trim your beard should you descend to Earth.
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, did he now? Well, if you notice, I have no beard. <br>
ACHILLES: If you had appeared to me in your true form, I would have
been truly blinded by your radiance. It is well known that when you
come amongst us you adopt many different forms. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, do I? <br>
ACHILLES: To Europa, you appeared as a bull. To Leda, as a swan. To me,
in the guise of an old beggar. <br>
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon. I do nothing of the kind! <br>
ACHILLES: Oh, but still your glory shines through! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, indeed. Indeed so. Yes, so I should hope. Yes, well, thank
you. I'm glad to meet you. Now, if you will excuse me, I must get back
to my temple. Attend to his funeral. <br>
ACHILLES: Oh, stop! You must not go. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you realise whom you are addressing? <br>
ACHILLES: Forgive me, father Zeus, I spoke hastily. <br>
DOCTOR: Then do not hinder me, or I will strike you with a thunderbolt!
<br>
ACHILLES: I must brave even the wrath of Zeus, and implore you to
remain. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don't see why I should. I have many other commitments,
you must understand. <br>
ACHILLES: And one of them lies here, in the camp of Agamemnon, our
general. Oh, hear me out, I pray. For ten long years now we have laid
siege to Troy and still they defy us. Come.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In the Tardis, Vicki and Steven watch on the
scanner as Achilles leads the Doctor to the top of a ridge.) <br>
STEVEN: Where's he off to now? It's a fine time to go looking at the
view. <br>
VICKI: After all, that's why he went out there, to find out where we
are. Anyway, that man looks quite friendly now. He's probably showing
him the way to the nearest town. <br>
STEVEN: Hmm, I wonder. I think I'd better try and find some more
suitable clothes.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Plain outside Troy]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACHILLES: There they sit, secure behind their
walls, whilst we rot in their summers and starve in their crack-bone
winters. <br>
(The Doctor and Achilles gaze upon the distant walled city is disturbed
by the arrival of Odysseus, King of Ithaca, accompanied by a group of
soldiers.) <br>
ODYSSEUS: What's this, Achilles? So far from camp, all unprotected from
a prisoner? <br>
ACHILLES: Odysseus, this is no prisoner. <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly not. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Not yet a prisoner? You should have called for assistance,
lad. We would not like to lose you. Come, let us escort you homewards.
Night might fall and find thee from thy tent. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't stand for that if I were you! <br>
ODYSSEUS: Are, but then, old fellow, you are not the Lord Achilles. He
is not the one to look for trouble, are you, boy? <br>
ACHILLES: Have a care, pirate. Are there no Trojan throats to slit,
that you dare tempt my sword? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Throats enough, I grant you. Some half score Trojans will not
whistle easy tonight. But what of you? <br>
ACHILLES: Oh, but a trifle. I met Prince Hector. Here he lies. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Zeus! <br>
ACHILLES: Was instrumental. <br>
ODYSSEUS: No doubt, no doubt. But what a year is this for plague. Even
the strongest might fall. Prince Hector, ha, that he should come to
this. You met him here, you say, as he lay dying? <br>
ACHILLES: I met him, Odysseus, in single combat. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it's true. <br>
ODYSSEUS: And raced him round the walls till down he fell exhausted. A
famous victory. <br>
ACHILLES: I met him face to face, I say. Battled with him for an hour
or more, until my greater strength overcame him. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Bravo. But tell me, Lightfoot, what of Zeus? You say he
intervened, and then? <br>
ACHILLES: Why, there he stands, and listens to your mockery. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I find it most interesting. <br>
ODYSSEUS: What? This old man? This threadbare grey pate? Oh come,
Achilles. <br>
ACHILLES: Oh, forgive him, father Zeus! He is but a rough and simple
sailor. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Aye, very rough, but scarce as simple as you seem to think.
What have we here? <br>
(Odysseus approaches the Tardis to examine it.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VICKI: Steven, he's coming in. <br>
(Steven has changed into Greek robes) <br>
STEVEN: No, the Doctor'll stop him. I must go out and help. <br>
VICKI: No. Don't. Just a minute. Here. Take this, and wait behind the
door, hmm?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Plain outside Troy]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ODYSSEUS: The temple of Zeus, you say? A trifle
modest, is it not, for so powerful a god. <br>
DOCTOR: This is my travelling temple. Being small, it's convenient. <br>
ACHILLES: You shall not enter. <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly not! In any case, I must be off. <br>
ACHILLES: Oh, then will you not stay with us? <br>
DOCTOR: No. I, er <br>
ODYSSEUS: What? You will to the Grecian camp. If indeed you be Zeus, we
have need of your assistance. Now, do not cower there, lads. Zeus is on
our side, so Agamemnon keeps insisting. Bear him up, and let us carry
him in triumph to the camp. <br>
DOCTOR: I am quite capable of walking. <br>
ACHILLES: Odysseus, I claim the honour to escort him. Let him walk to
camp with me. <br>
ODYSSEUS: You shall have honour enough, and maybe we shall have a
little of the truth. Father Zeus, we await you. We crave the pleasure
of your company at supper, and perhaps a tale or two of Aphrodite? <br>
DOCTOR: I refuse to enter into any kind of vulgar bawdry. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Then you shall tell why we find you lurking near our lines.
That should prove equally entertaining. Take him, lads! And two of you
there, take up this carrion! <br>
DOCTOR: Have a care! Do not touch me! <br>
ACHILLES: You will pay for this, Odysseus. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Ha, will I? We shall see. This much must we do for the Lord
Achilles, lest none believe his story. <br>
ACHILLES: You will not laugh so loud, I think, when Agamemnon hears of
this.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(From the Tardis, Steven and Vicki watch as the
soldiers march out of sight, carrying the Doctor.) <br>
STEVEN: I am going after him. I'm sure he's been taken prisoner. <br>
VICKI: Oh, come on. The big man was laughing. <br>
STEVEN: It didn't look as though the Doctor made a joke. <br>
VICKI: Anyway, we don't even know where we are. <br>
STEVEN: Well, the Doctor said they were Greeks. We're probably in
Greece. <br>
VICKI: Oh, but that would be wonderful, wouldn't it? We might meet the
Heroes. We might <br>
STEVEN: Those men who carried off the Doctor wouldn't be heroes, or
anything like them. That's why I've got to go and get him. <br>
VICKI: Well, I'm coming with you. <br>
STEVEN: And how far do you think you can get on that ankle? <br>
VICKI: It's not so bad now. I'll manage. <br>
STEVEN: No. You stay here. Rest your ankle, watch the scanners. You'll
be perfectly safe. When you see the Doctor and me coming, open the
doors. But not otherwise. <br>
VICKI: But Steven, we mustn't <br>
STEVEN: No! I haven't got time to argue. I want to get to the Doctor
before they cut his head off. Now stay here. <br>
VICKI: Goodbye. I hope you find the Doctor, that's all.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Agamemnon's tent]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Greek encampment is a short distance from the
walls of Troy. Inside the largest tent in the camp, the army's general,
Agamemnon, is feasting with his brother, Menelaus.) <br>
AGAMEMNON: Now you drink too much, Menelaus. I've told you about it
before. Why can't you learn to behave like a king instead of a
dropsical old camp follower? Have a little dignity. Try to remember
that you're my brother, can't you? <br>
MENELAUS: One of the reasons I drink, Agamemnon, is to forget that I am
your brother. Another is this ridiculous Trojan expedition. We've been
here for ten years! I want to go home. Besides, I'm not getting any
younger. <br>
AGAMEMNON: You won't get any older if you talk to me like that, brother
or no brother. What's the matter with you, man? Don't you want to get
Helen back? Don't you don't you want to see your wife again? <br>
MENELAUS: Quite frankly, no. If you must know, I was heartily glad to
see the back of her. <br>
AGAMEMNON: You mustn't talk like that in front of these. <br>
MENELAUS: It wasn't the first time she'd allowed herself to be
abducted. I can't keep on going off to the ends of the Earth to get her
back. It makes me a laughing stock. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Now you knew perfectly well what she was like before you
married her. Besides, this is a question of honour, to get her back.
Family honour, don't you understand? <br>
MENELAUS: Not to mention the trade routes through the Bosphorus, of
course. <br>
AGAMEMNON: What have they got to do with it? <br>
MENELAUS: It isn't enough for you that you control the Achaean League,
is it? Now you want to take over Asia Minor as well, only King Priam of
Troy stands in your way. <br>
AGAMEMNON: May I remind you that these ambitions would have been served
just as well if you had killed Paris in single combat, as you were
expected to? <br>
MENELAUS: Yes. But, I <br>
AGAMEMNON: And don't interrupt. <br>
MENELAUS: Oh. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Priam would have been quite prepared to let this contest
settle the issue between us. <br>
MENELAUS: Yes. But <br>
AGAMEMNON: Don't blame me because you've landed us into a full scale
war. <br>
MENELAUS: Yes, but I did challenge Paris, if you remember, ten years
ago. Fellow wouldn't accept. <br>
AGAMEMNON: He's just about as cowardly as you are. <br>
MENELAUS: For the last time, I am not a coward. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Well in that case, why don't you challenge someone else? <br>
MENELAUS: Anyone. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Challenge Hector. <br>
MENELAUS: Hector? Hector? Are you mad? Why, that'd be suicide. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Well, you don't know until you've tried it, do you? You
know, I think that's a very good idea of yours. <br>
MENELAUS: Oh. So you want to see me killed, is that it? Is nothing
sacred to you? <br>
AGAMEMNON: A brother's honour. I hold that more sacred than anything
else. That's why I shall issue the challenge in the morning, on your
behalf. <br>
MENELAUS: On my behalf? <br>
ACHILLES: My king. Hector is dead. <br>
AGAMEMNON: What? How did this happen? <br>
ACHILLES: This very day. I slew him after an hour or more of single
combat. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Oh, you did. Oh dear. There's another good idea wasted. <br>
ACHILLES: And what do you mean, wasted? Here have I been, fight <br>
AGAMEMNON: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes. It's only that Menelaus was just about to challenge him. <br>
MENELAUS: Now don't think I'm not pleased with what you've done. I am. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Sit down. Tell us all about it. <br>
ACHILLES: But, I have other more important news, and there isn't much
time. <br>
MENELAUS: What, more important than the death of Hector? <br>
ACHILLES: At the height of my battle with Hector, there came a sudden
lightning flash, and Zeus appeared before me. <br>
MENELAUS: Zeus! Oh. Eh? <br>
AGAMEMNON: It's all right, he's been listening to too much propaganda,
haven't you, Achilles? You mustn't take so much notice of that. <br>
ACHILLES: Look, I tell you it's true. He appeared to me from nowhere in
the shape of a little old man. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Oh! Where is he now, this little old Zeus? <br>
ACHILLES: He was about to accompany me here when Odysseus and his men
arrived. They took him prisoner. <br>
AGAMEMNON: They what? <br>
ACHILLES: Odysseus mocked him then they seized him and are bringing him
to camp. I ran ahead to warn you. <br>
AGAMEMNON: You did well. Perdition take Odysseus. You can't be too
careful in matters like this. He may in fact be Zeus. Guard! Go find
the Lord Odysseus. Command his presence here.
(A while later, Odysseus, having received the command, storms into
Agamemnon's tent.) <br>
ODYSSEUS: Who dares command Odysseus? Well, Agamemnon, is it you? Well,
we will not quarrel when we have a guest of such importance. Here's
this old man, claims to be our father Zeus. <br>
(The Doctor is shoved into the tent.) <br>
DOCTOR: You may rise. I am most displeased. Who is in command here? <br>
AGAMEMNON: I have that honour. <br>
DOCTOR: As I have always understood. Yet this mountebank Odysseus
appears to be a law unto himself. He makes fun of his guests, and
laughs at Zeus. <br>
AGAMEMNON: He will be reprimanded, if you are indeed who you say you
are. <br>
DOCTOR: If I am not a god, how do you account for my supernatural
knowledge? <br>
AGAMEMNON: Knowledge of what? <br>
DOCTOR: I could tell you one or two things that might surprise you. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Oh? Name one. <br>
DOCTOR: Your wife, for instance, is unfaithful to you. <br>
AGAMEMNON: What! <br>
ODYSSEUS: Everyone knows that. <br>
MENELAUS: I've never heard it. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Everyone, that is, except you and him, of course. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Silence! I will not have my wife's name banded about like
that. Besides, we have no way of checking on your slanderous
assertions, divinely inspired or no. What do you advise? <br>
DOCTOR: Then treat me with honour and return me to my temple, before I
really become angry. <br>
ACHILLES: I tell you, Agamemnon, he has come to help us. <br>
DOCTOR: If I were an enemy, what could one man do alone and unarmed
against the glory that is Greece, hmm? <br>
AGAMEMNON: Glory that is Greece, hmm? A neat phrase. <br>
ODYSSEUS: The man is a spy. Deal with him and be brief, or I shall
undertake it for you. <br>
ACHILLES: After I am dead, Odysseus, and only then. <br>
ODYSSEUS: If you so insist, I shall be most happy to oblige, Lightfoot.
<br>
AGAMEMNON: Silence! This is time for thought, not swordplay. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Well, since my thoughts are of such little account, allow me
to withdraw. <br>
ACHILLES: Forgive him, father Zeus. The man is a boor. If you command
me, I will deal with him. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, Achilles, leave him. Why try to kill him now when you
are in sight of victory. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Do you prophesy as much as that? <br>
DOCTOR: I could almost guarantee it. <br>
MENELAUS: Almost? Oh, not another ten years. <br>
DOCTOR: But first I would like to know am I to be treated as a god, or
as an enemy? If you kill me now, it will probably cost you the war. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Yes, that is so. On the other hand, if we don't kill you and
you are a spy, the same thing might happen. I propose to place you
under arrest. <br>
DOCTOR: Arrest? But I must return to my TAR, er, my temple. <br>
AGAMEMNON: A reverent arrest. You must not be offended. We shall enjoy
the benefit of your experience and your advice, and in return you will
enjoy our hospitality. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Excellent. Do sit down and have a ham bone. <br>
(Resigned to his fate, the Doctor joins Agamemnon and his brother at
their table.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steven has waited until nightfall to approach the
Greek encampment. Now, under cover of darkness, he picks his way
towards the lights of the camp, dodging past the dozen sentries. But
Steven's progress is observed from the shadows by a man with a patch
over one eye. The Greek spy, Cyclops. Odysseus meanwhile dismisses the
guard outside Agamemnon's tent in the hope of overhearing something of
use from within.) <br>
ODYSSEUS: Get thee to thy rest. <br>
(Once the guard has gone, Cyclops emerges from the shadows.) <br>
ODYSSEUS: Ah, my little Cyclops. What news, hmm? <br>
(Cyclops gestures.) <br>
ODYSSEUS: The stranger? Ah, the other stranger. Another stranger. From
the temple. Temple. In the camp! You think he is my enemy. You have
done well. Now, my little chatterbox, go back to the temple, see what
happens, hmm? <br>
(Odysseus spots Steven approaching.) <br>
ODYSSEUS: Get you gone. <br>
(Cyclops leaves and Odysseus ducks out of sight. As Steven peers into
the tent, the Greek appears out of the shadows behind him.) <br>
ODYSSEUS: What have we here? Another god, perhaps? <br>
STEVEN: No, I'm just a traveller. I lost my way and saw the light. <br>
ODYSSEUS: At least the god Apollo, to walk invisible past sentries. <br>
STEVEN: Sentries? I saw no sentries. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Oh? Then perhaps they are sleeping with a knife between their
ribs. Shall we go seek them together? <br>
STEVEN: Put away your sword. I'm a friend. <br>
ODYSSEUS: But a friend of whom? <br>
STEVEN: What do you mean? <br>
ODYSSEUS: That, that god who feasts yonder, that Trojan spy. <br>
STEVEN: I don't know him. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Do you not? We shall see! Move!

AGAMEMNON: Who is this? <br>
ODYSSEUS: My prisoner, the god Apollo. Achilles, will you not worship
him? He is a Trojan spy, but of such undoubted divinity he must be
spared. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Are you a Trojan, fellow? <br>
STEVEN: No, of course not. I'm just a traveller, of a sort. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Do you know this man? <br>
DOCTOR: Only for what he seems to be. <br>
ODYSSEUS: An acquaintance from Olympus, come to meet his father. <br>
STEVEN: My father? I've never seen him before in my life. <br>
AGAMEMNON: That's enough! Take him away, Odysseus. Why should I be
troubled with such petty prisoners? Cut out his tongue for insolence,
and make an end. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Softly now! All-seeing Zeus, you see into our very hearts and
know their secrets? <br>
DOCTOR: Quite so. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Then is this man a spy? <br>
DOCTOR: I do not know, and I do not care. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Shall he then be put to death? <br>
DOCTOR: I think it would be much safer on the whole. Stop! Have you
lost your senses? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Now we have it! On second thoughts, you think we should
release him to return to Troy. <br>
DOCTOR: Do not mock me, my Lord Odysseus. Would you stain the tent of
Agamemnon's with a Trojan's blood? I claim this man as a sacrifice to
Olympus! Bring him to my temple in the plain, at sunrise in the
morning, and I will show you a miracle. <br>
ODYSSEUS: A miracle. Oh, that would be most satisfactory. <br>
MENELAUS: Convincing proof, I would say. <br>
AGAMEMNON: What sort of miracle would <br>
DOCTOR: I will strike him with a bolt from heaven! <br>
ODYSSEUS: Very spectacular! <br>
(Two guards drag the struggling Cyclops into the tent.
AGAMEMNON: Ah, what's this? Who's this? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Release him. <br>
AGAMEMNON: All right, Odysseus. Who is this man? <br>
ODYSSEUS: My Cyclops. My little servant. So. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Well, can't he speak? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Alas no more. For once he spoke too loud for comfort, and
stammered on a knife. But he speaks to me. Get you gone and wait for
me. Thunder at the temple tomorrow, did you say? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I did. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Our weather is so unpredictable. If there is no thunder on
the plain, I have a sword will serve for two as well as one. Your
temple, as you call it, has disappeared. <br>
DOCTOR: Disappeared? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Vanished into thin air.

Agamemnon, Odysseus and a company of soldiers travel to the place where
the Tardis landed. There is no sign of the ship.) <br>
AGAMEMNON: Well, father Zeus, where is this temple of yours? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it should be about here somewhere. Rather hard to
understand, these sandy plains are so much alike. <br>
AGAMEMNON: Well, something has been here. Look. <br>
ODYSSEUS: And someone, too. For see, some several tracks lead off to
Troy. Lord Agamemnon, admit your fault. These men are spies! <br>
AGAMEMNON: So it would begin to seem. Bring on the prisoner. Well,
father Zeus, you have but one chance left to prove yourself. Kill this
Trojan spy. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Yes, fling a thunderbolt or some such to rise to the
occasion. <br>
DOCTOR: This sacrifice can only be performed within the temple. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Which temple is in Troy, therefore would we release you? Just
so. I for one have had enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Do not labour this point. I am not Zeus, and this young man is
a friend of mine. Neither of us are Trojans, sir. <br>
AGAMEMNON: I care not who you are. Seize him! It is enough that you
have trifled with my credulity and made me look a fool in front of all
my captains. Now, finish the business and be brief. And do not bring
their bodies back. Let them rot here, so that they can be an example to
their fellows. <br>
STEVEN: Are you quite sure Vicki couldn't have dematerialised the
Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course she couldn't. I told you last night. <br>
ODYSSEUS: First of all, myrmidons. Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I think you had better tell him. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, well, this may take some time. <br>
ODYSSEUS: I will be patient. But this time, if you value your lives, do
not lie to me. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In the main square of Troy, a crowd has gathered.
A group of soldiers are man-handling the off the cart that brought it
into the city.) <br>
PARIS: Sound the trumpets! Dismiss! <br>
PRIAM: Silence! Great Horse of Asia, is none of us to rest? Who's
there? <br>
PARIS: Paris, father, returned from patrol. <br>
PRIAM: Well, what news? Have you avenged your brother Hector? Have you?
Have you killed Achilles? <br>
PARIS: I sought Achilles, father, even to the Grecian lines, but he
skulked within his tent. He feared to face me. <br>
PRIAM: Well go back and wait until he gets his courage up. Upon my
soul, what sort of brother are you? Furthermore, what sort of son?
What, what is that you have got there? <br>
PARIS: Ah. A prize, father, captured from the Greeks. <br>
PRIAM: Hmm, captured, you say? I wager they were glad to see the back
of it. What is it? <br>
PARIS: What is it? Well, it's, ah it's, ah sort of, er, a shrine, or so
it seems. <br>
(King Priam strides up to the Tardis door and tries to open it. Inside,
Vicki watches with increasing horror as Priam's face looms on the
scanner.) <br>
PRIAM: And what, may I ask, do you propose to do with this seeming
shrine? <br>
PARIS: Well, I had rather thought of putting it in the temple. <br>
CASSANDRA: Ha! You're not putting that in my temple. <br>
PRIAM: I should think not indeed, bringing back blessed shrines. Go
back and bring Achilles' body, if you want to do something useful. Get
back to the war. <br>
CASSANDRA: And take that thing with you. <br>
PARIS: Oh, really! If you if you knew the weight of this, this, this
thing. Father, if Cassandra doesn't want it, can't we just leave it
where it is for the moment? <br>
PRIAM: In the middle of the square? <br>
PARIS: Yes. I mean, it could be a sort of, er, sort of a monument. <br>
CASSANDRA: A monument to what? <br>
PARIS: Well, to my initiative, for instance. After all, it is the first
sizeable trophy we've captured since the war started. Probably turn out
to be very useful. <br>
CASSANDRA: What sort of use would you suggest? <br>
PARIS: What sort of use. Well, I don't quite know, actually. But, I
mean, once we've examined it thoroughly, it'll probably prove to have
all sorts of uses. <br>
CASSANDRA: I'm quite sure. Uses to the Greeks. <br>
PARIS: What do you mean? <br>
CASSANDRA: Why do you imagine that they allowed you to capture it? <br>
PARIS: Allowed me? Allowed me? Now you look here, Cassandra. <br>
CASSANDRA: Where did you find it? <br>
PARIS: Where'd I find it? Where d'you think? Out there in the middle of
the plain. <br>
CASSANDRA: Unguarded, I suppose. <br>
PARIS: Yes, of course. I, I mean, yes, it was. <br>
CASSANDRA: Just as I thought. Can't you see that you were meant to
bring it into Troy? <br>
PARIS: No, I can't see, quite frankly. <br>
PRIAM: I think I'm beginning to see. <br>
PARIS: What are you two getting at? <br>
CASSANDRA: You've broken my dreams. The auguries were bad this morning.
I woke full of foreboding. <br>
PARIS: Never knew her when she didn't. <br>
PRIAM: Paris, your sister is High Priestess. Let her speak. <br>
PARIS: All right, Cassandra. Now, what was this dream about? <br>
CASSANDRA: Thank you. I dreamed that out on the plain the Greeks had
left a gift, and although what it was remained unclear, we brought it
into Troy. Then at night, from out its belly, soldiers came and fell
upon us as we slept. <br>
PARIS: Yes, well I hardly think we need trouble to interpret that one.
Oh really, Cassandra, have you looked at this thing, as you call it? I
mean, just how many soldiers do you think you can get inside that? A
whole regiment, perhaps? I mean, you'd be very lucky to get even two
medium-sized soldiers out of that thing. <br>
CASSANDRA: Fool! One soldier could unbar the gate and so admit an army.
It's exactly the sort of scheme Odysseus would think of. <br>
PRIAM: Why don't we open the thing and see? <br>
PARIS: Yes, well, that is rather the point. You see, there is a door,
but it doesn't seem to open. <br>
CASSANDRA: Just as I said, it's locked from the inside. <br>
PRIAM: Oh, it is, is it? Stand aside. <br>
(Priam attacks the Tardis door with Paris' sword, but to no effect.) <br>
PARIS: Well, there you are, father. Perhaps you'll believe me next
time, I suppose. Oh, Cassandra, perhaps you would like to care to have
a try. <br>
CASSANDRA: The thing need not be opened. Bring branches, fire and
sacrificial oil. We'll make of it an offering to the gods of Troy. And
if there be someone within, so much the greater gift.

STEVEN: So really, you see, we arrived in your time entirely by
accident. It's just another miscalculation by the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I would hardly call it a miscalculation, my boy. <br>
STEVEN: Well, then, what would you call it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think with all eternity to choose from, I did rather
well to get us back to Earth. <br>
STEVEN: I'm very glad you're pleased with yourself. I suppose I should
be grateful for standing here, trussed like a chicken, ready to have me
throat cut. <br>
ODYSSEUS: No one mentioned cutting throats. <br>
DOCTOR: No, they didn't. <br>
ODYSSEUS: I had I had something more lingering in mind. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I dare say. I suppose some kind of ritual death, I
presume? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Sit down. Sit down! In my life I have travelled far, and met
many deplorable people, but not one of them has had the credulity
strained as I have strained today by your effrontery, Doctor. Your
story is probably true, otherwise you would never have dared to tell
it. Stand up! I propose to release you. <br>
STEVEN: We might have expected That's very nice of you. <br>
ODYSSEUS: No, no, it isn't. Release, but on certain conditions. <br>
DOCTOR: And what are those conditions, may I ask? <br>
ODYSSEUS: That you use your supernatural knowledge to devise a scheme
whereby we capture Troy. I will give you two days. Two days to think of
something really ingenious. <br>
DOCTOR: Two days! That isn't very long, is it. <br>
ODYSSEUS: It should be ample if you are as clever as you say you are. <br>
STEVEN: What happens if we fail? <br>
ODYSSEUS: If I fail, then I shall have been foolish. And I would hate
to seem foolish having believed your story. Indeed, I should be very,
very angry! <br>

piled around the base of the Tardis. Priam, Paris and Cassandra watch
as a priestess pours oil over the wood. Soldiers stand ready with
torches.) <br>
PRIAM: That should make quite a blaze. <br>
PARIS: Yes. Just one moment. Before we actually light the fire,
shouldn't we see if such a gift would be acceptable to the gods? I
mean, if it does contain treachery, might it not seem the most awful
insult? <br>
PRIAM: Oh, good point, I suppose. Have a word with them, Cassandra. <br>
CASSANDRA: I assure you it's quite unnecessary. <br>
PARIS: Yes, but better to be on the safe side. Don't you think? <br>
CASSANDRA: Oh, hear me, you horses of the heavens, who gallop with our
destiny. If you would accept this gift, let us see a sign. Show us your
will, I pray you, for we are merely mortal and need your guidance. <br>
(At that moment, Vicki steps down from the Tardis, dressed in an
elegant gown.) <br>
PARIS: Well! <br>

PARIS: This is no horse of heaven. <br>
PRIAM: And this is no soldier either. <br>
CASSANDRA: Who are you? <br>
VICKI: I'm nobody of any importance. I'm just someone from the future. <br>
PARIS: The future? <br>
CASSANDRA: How do you so? You're no Trojan goddess. Are you some puny
pagan goddess of the Greeks? <br>
VICKI: Of course not. I'm as human as you are. <br>
CASSANDRA: Then how comes it that you claim to know the future? <br>
PARIS: Oh really, Cassandra. You're always going on and on about it
yourself. <br>
CASSANDRA: I'm a priestess, skilled in augury. <br>
PARIS: Yes, I know, all those dreary flights of birds and entrails and
all that kind of thing. Well, I mean, perhaps she's read the same ones.
I shouldn't imagine you have a monopoly. <br>
CASSANDRA: Are you a priestess? <br>
VICKI: Not that I know of. I mean, I never took any exams or anything. <br>
CASSANDRA: Then how dare you practice prophecy! <br>
VICKI: Well, I haven't done yet, have I? <br>
CASSANDRA: She's some drab of Agamemnon's, sent to spread dissention. <br>
VICKI: I'm nothing of the sort. <br>
PARIS: Of course you're not. I can tell. <br>
VICKI: I've never even met Agamemnon. <br>
PRIAM: I wish to question her. Come here, child. That's better. Now,
are you a Greek? <br>
VICKI: No, I am from the future. So you see, I don't have to prophesy,
because as far as I'm concerned, the future has already happened! <br>
PRIAM: I don't quite follow. <br>
CASSANDRA: Of course you don't. She's trying to confuse you. Kill the
girl before she addles all our wits. She's a sorceress. She must die. <br>
PARIS: Oh, don't be absurd. You're not to touch her. <br>
PRIAM: I wish you'd both keep quiet just for a moment. Now don't be
frightened, child. You shall die when I say so, and not a moment
before. <br>
VICKI: That's very comforting. <br>
PRIAM: Now, you see? Neither of you has the least idea how to handle
children. All you need is a little kindness and understanding. Now,
first of all, what is your name? <br>
VICKI: Vicki. <br>
PRIAM: Vicki? That's a very outlandish name. <br>
CASSANDRA: A heathen sort of name, if you ask me. <br>
PRIAM: Nobody did ask you, Cassandra. Well, I really don't think we can
call you Vicki. We shall have to think another one for you, shan't we?
Let me see, how about, Cressida. Would you think that would be all
right? <br>
VICKI: It's a very pretty name. <br>
PRIAM: Very well, then. Cressida it shall be. Now you claim, Cressida,
to come from the future? <br>
VICKI: Yes. <br>
PRIAM: So you know everything that's going to happen. <br>
VICKI: Well, I <br>
PRIAM: Look, Cressida, come into the palace. I expect you could do with
something to eat. <br>
VICKI: Oh, thank you, that would be very nice. <br>
PARIS: Ah, that's a very good idea, I've not eaten since the <br>
PRIAM: You get back to the war! If you've not killed Achilles by
nightfall, I shall be seriously displeased. <br>
PARIS: But look, father, why couldn't Troilus go? I mean, it's much
more his sort of thing. <br>
PRIAM: Hector. Don't argue, Paris! Get back to the war! <br>
PARIS: Right. Well, bye, Cressida. We shall meet again this evening,
all being well. <br>
VICKI: Goodbye, Paris. Thank you very much for trying to help me. <br>
PARIS: Oh, not at all. It was a great pleasure. <br>
PRIAM: Come, Cressida. You and I have a great deal to say to each
other. I have a feeling you are going to bring us luck. <br>
CASSANDRA: She will bring nothing but doom, death and disaster. <br>
PRIAM: Don't pay any attention to Cassandra. She takes the gloomiest
view. I suspect it's a kind of insurance, so that if things do go wrong
she can always say 'I told you so.' Come along. <br>
CASSANDRA: Hear me, gods of Troy. Strike with your lightnings this
usurper. Or show me a sign that she is false, and then I'll strike her
down myself!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(In a tent in the Greek camp, Steven and the Doctor
are discussing plans for the capture of Troy.) <br>
STEVEN: Why not the wooden horse? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear boy, I couldn't possibly suggest that. The whole
story is obviously absurd. Probably invented by Homer as some good
dramatic device. No, I think it would be completely impractical. <br>
STEVEN: Yes, well, if you say so, Doctor. But in that case, hurry up
and think of something else. The only way we can rescue Vicki is to get
into Troy. We've only got two days left. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, patience, my <br>
ODYSSEUS: Rather less now. Haven't you thought of anything yet? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I have thought up of some conditions of my own. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Oh, really? I don't see how you're going to enforce them, but
what are they? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's all very simple. That is, if you want me to help you
sack the city, you must promise me that Vicki will be spared. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Vicki? Who's she? <br>
STEVEN: Oh, you know, I told you about her. Look, if they have taken
the time machine into Troy, then she'll still be inside it. <br>
ODYSSEUS: I hope she is, for her sake. Because if she left it, she's
past worrying about now. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we're not quite sure of that, are we? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Perhaps not, but I don't know what you expect me to do about
it. When we enter Troy, I can't stop every woman and ask her if she's a
friend of yours. It wouldn't be practical. <br>
MESSENGER: Lord Odysseus? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Yes, what is it? <br>
MESSENGER: Prince Paris has called again for my Lord Achilles. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Well? <br>
MESSENGER: Our Lord Agamemnon asked that you go in his stead. <br>
ODYSSEUS: To fight that fool? <br>
MESSENGER: Yes. <br>
ODYSSEUS: That puny princeling cannot fight! A waste of time. Go tell
our Lord Agamemnon, if he wants someone to fight Achilles' battles, to
go himself. Now get out. <br>
STEVEN: Is Paris such a bad fighter? <br>
ODYSSEUS: The weakling cannot stomach killing. <br>
STEVEN: Let me go to Troy. Now, before you attack. <br>
ODYSSEUS: What's that? <br>
STEVEN: To get Vicki. After all, I'm no use here. I'm sure the Doctor
can manage very well without me. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, are you quite sure? <br>
STEVEN: Look, it's perfectly simple. I allow Paris to take me prisoner.
<br>
ODYSSEUS: You really are most anxious to die. They will take you for a
spy, as we did. <br>
STEVEN: Not if I were wearing a uniform. I'd be a prisoner of war. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Well, I don't know what they're doing with their prisoners of
war at the moment. It rather depends on how they're feeling at the
time, I imagine. They're a very unpredictable lot, these Trojans. <br>
STEVEN: Well, I'm prepared to take the risk if you're prepared to let
me go. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Really, that's very courageous of you. <br>
STEVEN: Then you'll help me? <br>
ODYSSEUS: I don't see why not, because as you said, you're of little
particular use here. <br>
STEVEN: What about the uniform? <br>
ODYSSEUS: Ah! Ah, let me see. Last week, my friend Diomede died from
his wounds in this camp. Now, you're about his size. You'll find his
thing in the next tent. <br>
STEVEN: Thank you, Odysseus. <br>
ODYSSEUS: You really are a very brave man indeed. I should have been
most distressed to have had to put you to death myself. <br>
STEVEN: A very consoling thought. I'll see you both before I go. <br>
ODYSSEUS: Now then, Doctor, to work. I hope you're not going to
disappoint me. <br>
DOCTOR: I sincerely hope not. Have you thought of tunnelling? <br>
ODYSSEUS: It's been done. What we want is something revolutionary. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Dear me, sear me. Well, tell me, have you thought
about flying machines? <br>

assure you I have no quarrel with you. <br>
STEVEN: I'm Greek, you're Trojan. Is not that quarrel enough? <br>

carried just a little bit too far. I mean, that Helen thing was just a
misunderstanding. <br>

PARIS: Well, I say, this sort of thing is just not done. I mean, surely
you'd rather die than be taken prisoner? <br>
STEVEN: Well, yes, but, only in a general sort of way, you see. You
see, when I first challenged you, little did I know that you were
indeed the Lion of Troy. <br>
PARIS: Yes, I <br>
STEVEN: I should have listened to my friends. <br>
PARIS: Why? What do they say? <br>
STEVEN: Why, that they would rather face Prince Hector and Troilus
together than the mighty Paris. That you are unconquerable. <br>
PARIS: Really? They don't say that in Troy. <br>
STEVEN: Oh, I could tell them a tale or two of your valour that that
would make even King Priam blanch to hear. <br>
PARIS: I say, could you really? <br>
STEVEN: Yes, and will. Why, I hope my Lord Achilles does not meet you.
Even now he searches the plain for you, and what indeed would happen to
our cause if he were vanquished? <br>
PARIS: Well, I don't really see how I can oblige him if I have a
prisoner. I mean, there will come a day of reckoning, of course, but,
well, for the moment, pick up your sword! Now, I suppose I shall have
to drive you like a Grecian cur into the city, won't I? Excuse me a
moment. Farewell, Achilles! For today, Paris of Troy has other
business! Come, dog! (Paris retrieves his sword and they depart for
Troy) Oh, yes.

He's in command of our mobile force. Spends most of his time harrying
the Greek supply routes with his cavalry. <br>
VICKI: I didn't know cavalry was invented yet? <br>

came from central Asia, found this strategic position and chose to
fortify it. We only need now to beat the Greeks a few score more
horses. <br>

good looks. Only gets you into trouble. Look at Paris. Handsome as the

CASSANDRA: How dare you! I am High Priestess of Troy! <br>
PARIS: All right then, get back to your temple before you give us all
galloping religious mania. Oh, really, father. I can't tolerate another
of her tedious tirades at the moment. <br>
CASSANDRA: Father, do you hear him? <br>
PRIAM: Yes, it's quite refreshing. It seems there's a man lurking
behind that flaccid facade after all. <br>
PARIS: Really, father, I do wish you'd refrain from patronising me in
front of the prisoner. <br>
PRIAM: The prisoner. Oh, that's it. One pathetic prisoner and he thinks
he's Hercules. Your success has gone to your head. <br>
PARIS: Just before you start sneering at this prisoner, perhaps you
should know that his name is Diomede. And if you look in the Greek army
lists, you'll see he's quite a catch. <br>
STEVEN: Which none but you could have caught, oh Lion of Troy. <br>
CASSANDRA: What was that? <br>
PARIS: Well, there you are, you see. Right. Go on, go on. Tell them,
Diomede. <br>
STEVEN: We fought. I lost. I am not ashamed. There is none in all our
ranks who could stand against the wrath of Paris when he seeks revenge.
<br>
PARIS: Yes, very good. Very good, yes. There you are, you see? I'm
treated with more respect by the enemy than I am by my own family. <br>
CASSANDRA: They don't know you as well as we do. <br>
PARIS: Perhaps better! And perhaps the time has come for you to start
revising your opinions, sister. <br>
CASSANDRA: You forget one thing. Your prisoner and that girl have
clearly met before. <br>
VICKI: Why won't you let me explain that. It's really all quite simple.
<br>
PRIAM: Yes, I'm sure it is. But Paris claimed Diomede here as a Greek
prisoner. And Cassandra claims that you are a Greek spy. <br>
CASSANDRA: And a sorceress. <br>
PRIAM: Yes, quite. After all, you do claim to know the future. <br>
VICKI: Yes, but don't you see, that's <br>
PRIAM: Hush, my child. This war with the Greeks has been going on for
ten long years, and frankly we're very bored with being penned up here.
Now if you are what you really say you are, as a pledge of good faith
to us, you must either give me information that will lead to our speedy
victory, or use your supernatural powers to turn the tide of battle in
our favour. <br>
VICKI: But suppose I don't? Suppose the Greeks win? <br>
CASSANDRA: You will be burnt as a sorceress, a false prophet, and a
spy. <br>
PRIAM: Well, as one of them, anyway. But I have every confidence in
you, Cressida. And I will give you one whole day to decide which to do.
<br>
STEVEN: One day? <br>
PRIAM: Yes. <br>
STEVEN: But <br>
PRIAM: Till tomorrow evening, to be precise. Now if you have no
objection, I think they ought to be taken away. <br>
PARIS: Oh, yes, yes, I think that's all very fair. <br>
VICKI: Where are they taking us? <br>
PRIAM: To the dungeons. Oh, don't worry, you'll find them quite
comfortable. I often spend an hour or two down there myself when I've
got tired of things up here. <br>
STEVEN: How long do you intend to keep us there? <br>
CASSANDRA: Till you rot. <br>
PRIAM: Oh, well really, Cassandra. Though that may be true in your
case, Diomede, but I trust Cressida will join us before tomorrow
evening. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, think, my dear Odysseus. A whole fleet of them carrying a
company of soldiers over the walls and into Troy. <br>
ODYSSEUS: How would we get them into the air? <br>
DOCTOR: Catapults! <br>
ODYSSEUS: Catapults? That sounds like a vulgar oath to me! I must try
it on Agamemnon. Catapults! <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense! The catapult is, well, you could make one for
yourself out of strips of ox hide, and secure both ends, and then
stretch it out like a bow-string. <br>
ODYSSEUS: I see. <br>
DOCTOR: Then you pour water over it, let it dry in the sun, and what
happens then? <br>
ODYSSEUS: It begins to smell. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind that. It shrinks. Now, allow me to demonstrate. You
place the flying machine thus, as you would an arrow in a bow, and let
it go. <br>
ODYSSEUS: What happens? <br>
DOCTOR: The machine flies in the air with a soldier clinging to its

else. <br>

could operate it. <br>

us a great deal of worry. <br>
CASSANDRA: She didn't tell you because it's some form of treachery.
Don't trust her, father. <br>
PRIAM: Oh, stuff and nonsense. Oh, go and feed the sacred serpents or
something. If you can't be pleasant at a time like this, Cassandra, I
don't want to see you. Oh, Paris! Have the Greeks really gone? <br>
PARIS: Every last one of them, or so it seems. <br>
PRIAM: There you are, Cassandra. I told you so. Oh, do for goodness
sake, smile. <br>
PARIS: But, more important, I think I've just found the Great Horse of
Asia. <br>
PRIAM: You've done what? <br>
PARIS: Something uncommonly like it, anyway. <br>
PRIAM: What on earth are you talking about? <br>
PARIS: The Great Horse of Asia. Standing all by itself in the middle of
the plain, about forty foot high and made of wood. <br>
PRIAM: Whereabouts in the middle of the plain? <br>
PARIS: Near the Grecian line. Look. You can just see it from here. <br>
PRIAM: Great heavens, I do believe you're right. It is the Great Horse
of Asia. <br>
CASSANDRA: It's an omen. An omen of disaster. <br>
VICKI: (sotto) It is the Trojan Horse. But I thought you <br>
TROILUS: What was that? <br>
CASSANDRA: Yes, ask her! Go on, ask her! She knows what it is. It's our
doom! It's the death of Troy, brought upon us by that cursed witch! <br>
PARIS: Now understand me, Cassandra. I will not have one word said
against that horse. <br>
TROILUS: And neither will I against Cressida. <br>
CASSANDRA: Will you not? Then woe to the House of Priam. Woe to the
Trojans. <br>
PARIS: I'm afraid you're a bit late to say 'whoa' to the horse. I've
just given instructions to have it brought into the city.

it luck to have the entire Greek army removed from our shores. Peace at
