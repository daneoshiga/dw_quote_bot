instead of the other way around. She changes it.) <br>
GEOFF: Sorry. <br>
(The organist strikes up the Wedding March. The bride and her father
begin to process down the aisle. There is a strange sound, the bride
screams and then zooms up through the roof and away in a golden
sparkle.) <br>

DOCTOR: But <br>
DONNA: Where am I? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
DONNA: What the hell is this place? <br>
DOCTOR: What? You can't do that. I wasn't. We're in flight. That is,
that is physically impossible! How did <br>

DONNA: The what? <br>
DOCTOR: It's called the Tardis. <br>
DONNA: That's not even a proper word. You're just saying things. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you get in here? <br>
DONNA: Well, obviously, when you kidnapped me. Who was it? Who's paying
you? Is it Nerys? Oh my God, she's finally got me back. This has got
Nerys written all over it. <br>
DOCTOR: Who the hell is Nerys? <br>
DONNA: Your best friend. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on, wait a minute. What are you dressed like that for? <br>
DONNA: I'm going ten pin bowling. Why do you think, dumbo? I was
halfway up the aisle! I've been waiting all my life for this. I was
just seconds away, and then you, I don't know, you drugged me or
something! <br>
DOCTOR: I haven't done anything! <br>
DONNA: I'm having the police on you! Me and my husband, as soon as he
is my husband, we're
going to sue the living backside off you! <br>
(Donna runs down the ramp to the doors.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't! <br>
(She opens the doors and looks at a pretty gaseous nebula.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're in space. Outer space. This is my space ship. It's
called the Tardis. <br>
DONNA: How am I breathing? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis is protecting us. <br>
DONNA: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. You? <br>
DONNA: Donna. <br>
DOCTOR: Human? <br>
DONNA: Yeah. Is that optional? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it is for me. <br>
DONNA: You're an alien. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
DONNA: It's freezing with these doors open. <br>
(The Doctor slams the doors shut and goes back to the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: I don't understand that and I understand everything. This this
can't happen! There is no way a human being can lock itself onto the
Tardis and transport itself inside. It must be <br>

DOCTOR: Impossible. Some sort of subatomic connection? Something in the
temporal field? Maybe something pulling you into alignment with the
Chronon shell. Maybe something macro mining your DNA within the
interior matrix. Maybe a genetic <br>

DOCTOR: What was that for? <br>
DONNA: Get me to the church! <br>
DOCTOR: Right! Fine! I don't want you here anyway! Where is this
wedding? <br>
DONNA: Saint Mary's, Hayden Road, Chiswick, London, England, Earth, the
Solar System. <br>
(Donna grabs a blouse that is hanging over the railing.) <br>
DONNA: I knew it, acting all innocent. I'm not the first, am I? How
many women have you abducted? <br>
DOCTOR: That's my friend's. <br>
DONNA: Where is she, then? Popped out for a space walk? <br>
DOCTOR: She's gone. <br>
DONNA: Gone where? <br>
DOCTOR: I lost her. <br>
DONNA: Well, you can hurry up and lose me! How do you mean, lost? <br>

doorway.) <br>

SYLVIA: No, she didn't run away. We're not talking jitters. She
literally vanished. Now, go and check the house and see if she's there.
Oh, Angelica, that's not helping, is it? Now, smarten up. <br>
ANGELICA: Right, sorry. <br>
SYLVIA: Lance, any sign? <br>
(Lance is the groom.) <br>
LANCE: I've looked all around and I can't find her. Where the hell did
she go? <br>
SYLVIA: Showing off, that's what she is! First day at school, she was
sent home for biting. <br>
GEOFF: Well, it's a bit more serious than that. She's never disappeared
before. <br>
SYLVIA: She didn't disappear, it's a trick! It's one of her silly
little look at me party pieces. But what if she's dead? <br>
GEOFF: Oh, don't say that.

What have you eaten? What's wrong? Donna? You've really
got to think. Is there anything that might've caused this? <br>
(Donna is making the traditional circuit of the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Anything you might've done? Any sort of alien contacts? I can't
let you go wandering off. What if you're dangerous. I mean, have you,
have you seen lights in the sky, or did you touch something like
something, something different, something strange? Or something made
out of a, box of metal or. Who're you getting married to? Are you sure
he's human? He's not a bit overweight with a zip around his forehead,
is he? Donna!

transcendentalism and is walking away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Donna. <br>
DONNA: Leave me alone. I just want to get married. <br>
DOCTOR: Come back to the Tardis. <br>
DONNA: No way. That box is too weird. <br>
DOCTOR: It's bigger on the inside, that's all. <br>
DONNA: Oh! That's all? Ten past three. I'm going to miss it. <br>
DOCTOR: You can phone them. Tell them where you are. <br>
DONNA: How do I do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't you got a mobile? <br>
DONNA: I'm in my wedding dress. It doesn't have pockets. Who has
pockets? Have you ever seen a bride with pockets? When I went to my
fitting at Chez Alison, the one thing I forgot to say is give me
pockets! <br>
DOCTOR: This man you're marrying. What's his name? <br>
DONNA: Lance. <br>
DOCTOR: Good luck, Lance. <br>
DONNA: Oi! No stupid Martian is going to stop me from getting married.
To hell with you! <br>

DOCTOR: There's one! <br>
DONNA: Oi! <br>
DOCTOR: Do you have this effect on everyone? Why aren't they stopping? <br>
DONNA: They think I'm in fancy dress. <br>

DONNA: They think I'm drunk. <br>
MEN IN CAR: You're fooling no one, mate! <br>
DONNA: They think I'm in drag! <br>

to pick them up.)

DONNA: And that goes double for your mother! I'll have him. I've got
his number. I'll have him. Talk about the Christmas spirit. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it Christmas? <br>
DONNA: Well, duh. Maybe not on Mars, but here it's Christmas Eve. Phone
box! We can reverse the charges! <br>
DOCTOR: How come you're getting married on Christmas Eve? <br>
DONNA: Can't bear it. I hate Christmas. Honeymoon, Morocco. Sunshine,
lovely. What's the operator? I've not done this in years. What do you
dial? 100? <br>
(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver and gets a dialling tone.) <br>
DOCTOR: Just call the direct. <br>
DONNA: What did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: Something Martian. Now phone. I'll get money! <br>

anyone got a charger? <br>
LANCE: Have you tried the hotel? Hello? Hello? Vicar, is your phone
working? Mine's run out! <br>

VICAR: I've got one wedding about to arrive and another wedding
refusing to leave, so yes, I do think it's a police matter.

Oh, my God, I don't know where I am! It's a street, and there's WH
Smith but it's definitely Earth. <br>
(The Doctor gives the London Credit Bank ATM the sonic treatment, and
goes straight to Please Take Your Cash without the rest of the
preamble. Donna accosts a woman in the street.) <br>
DONNA: Excuse me. I'm begging you. I'm getting married, I really am and
I'm late and I just need to borrow a tenner and I'll pay you back I
promise and it's Christmas. <br>
(The Doctor takes the money from the ATM then spots a trio of Santas
playing God Rest Ye Merry on brass instruments.) <br>
DONNA: Taxi! St Mary's Chiswick. Thanks for nothing, spaceman! I'll see
you in Court. <br>
(Donna gets into the taxi, which is driven by another Santa.) <br>
DOCTOR: Donna! <br>
(Donna drives away. The Santas point their instruments at the Doctor,
so he zaps the ATM, which sends banknotes flying across the street.
Lots of people rush to grab the money and he runs away.)

DONNA: Hold on a minute. I said Chiswick. You've missed the turning.
Excuse me, we should've turned off back there. We're going the wrong
way! <br>
(The Doctor starts the Tardis going as the taxi pulls onto the flyover,
missing another car by inches.) <br>
DONNA: What the hell are you doing? I'm late for the wedding. My own
wedding. Do you get that? <br>
(The Tardis is tracking Donna.) <br>
DONNA: Turn around! Turn this cab around right now! Are you deaf or
what? <br>

it is a robot.) <br>

tarmac.) <br>
DONNA: You are kidding me. <br>
(The Tardis weaves through the traffic as the Doctor ties a piece of
string around a control lever. It comes alongside the taxi. The Doctor
opens the doors holding the other end of the string in his teeth.) <br>
DOCTOR: Open the door! <br>
DONNA: Do what? <br>
DOCTOR: Open the door! <br>
DONNA: I can't, it's locked! <br>
(The Doctor uses the sonic screwdriver. Donna gets the window open.) <br>
DONNA: Santa's a robot. <br>
DOCTOR: Donna, open the door. <br>
DONNA: What for? <br>
DOCTOR: You've got to jump! <br>
DONNA: I'm not blinking flip jumping. I'm supposed to be getting
married! <br>
(The robot accelerates away. The Doctor pulls on his string, there are
more bangs from the console and the Tardis gives chase, bouncing off
the roof of a car. When it is close enough, the Doctor tries the
screwdriver on the robot driver. It clamps its hands onto the steering
wheel.) <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me. You've got to jump. <br>
DONNA: I'm not jumping on a motorway. <br>
DOCTOR: Whatever that thing is, it needs you. And whatever it needs you
for, it's not good! Now, come on! <br>
DONNA: I'm in my wedding dress! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you look lovely! Come on! <br>
(Donna opens the door. The Doctor reaches out for her. The kids in the
Range Rover ahead shout jump!) <br>
DONNA: I can't do it. <br>
DOCTOR: Trust me. <br>
DONNA: Is that what you said to her? Your friend? The one you lost? Did
she trust you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, she did. And she is not dead. She is so alive. Now, jump! <br>
(Donna launches herself out of the taxi and lands on top of the Doctor.
The children celebrate. The Tardis doors slam shut and it zooms
upwards.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3.30. The Doctor is emptying a fire extinguisher
in through the Tardis doors. A lot of smoke is coming out.) <br>
DOCTOR: The funny thing is, for a spaceship, she doesn't really do that
much flying. We'd better give her a couple of hours. You all right? <br>
DONNA: Doesn't matter. <br>
DOCTOR: Did we miss it? <br>
DONNA: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you can book another date. <br>
DONNA: Course we can. <br>
DOCTOR: You've still got the honeymoon. <br>
DONNA: It's just a holiday now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. <br>
DONNA: It's not your fault. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? That's a change. <br>
DONNA: Wish you had a time machine, then we could go back and get it
right. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. But even if I did, I couldn't go back on someone's
personal timeline. Apparently. <br>
(Donna sits on the edge of the roof, looking towards St Paul's
Cathedral and the City beyond. The Doctor takes off his jacket and puts
it around her shoulders.) <br>
DONNA: God, you're skinny. This wouldn't fit a rat. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh and you'd better put this on. <br>
(A gold ring.) <br>
DONNA: Oh, do you have to rub it in? <br>
DOCTOR: Those creatures can trace you. This is a bio-damper. Should
keep you hidden. With this ring, I thee bio-damp. <br>
DONNA: For better or for worse. So, come on then. Robot santas, what
are they for? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, your basic robo scavenger. The Father Christmas stuff is
just a disguise. They're trying to blend in. I met them last Christmas.
<br>
DONNA: Why, what happened then? <br>
DOCTOR: Great big spaceship hovering over London? You didn't notice? <br>
DONNA: I had a bit of a hangover. <br>
DOCTOR: I spent Christmas Day just over there, the Powell Estate, with
this family. My friend, she had this family. Well, they were. Still,
gone now. <br>
DONNA: Your friend, who was she? <br>
DOCTOR: Question is, what do camouflaged robot mercenaries want with
you? And how did you get inside the Tardis? I don't know. What's your
job? <br>
DONNA: I'm a secretary. <br>
(The Doctor scans her with the sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's weird. I mean, you're not special, you're not powerful,
you're not connected, you're not clever, you're not important. <br>
DONNA: This friend of yours. Just before she left, did she punch you in
the face? Stop bleeping me! <br>
DOCTOR: What kind of secretary? <br>

remembers the fun times with Rose.) <br>

more. Cos love it stays within you, it doesn't wash up on a shore. Then

a table. The Doctor looks up over the DJ's sound desk to see six
Santa's all lined up in front of the bar.) <br>

sonic screwdriver, don't let him near the sound system. <br>

DONNA: But what do they want with me? <br>
DOCTOR: Somehow you've been dosed with Huon energy. And that's a
problem, because Huon energy hasn't existed since the Dark Times. The
only place you'd find a Huon particle now is a remnant in the heart of
the Tardis. See? That's what happened. Say, that's the Tardis. (He

LANCE: Your people? Who are they? What company do you represent? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm a freelancer. But this lot are rebuilding them. They've

(The Doctor removes the robot mask and robe.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well. Nice try. I've got you, Donna! <br>
(He points his sonic screwdriver at Donna, and the web starts to give
way.) <br>
DONNA: I'm going to fall! <br>
DOCTOR: You're going to swing! I've got you! <br>
(Screaming, Donna swings across the hole, past the Empress and stops
underneath the landing where the Doctor is standing. The strand of web
was just six feet too long. She drops to the ground with a clang.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Sorry. <br>
DONNA: Thanks for nothing. <br>
EMPRESS: The doctor man amuses me. <br>
DOCTOR: Empress of the Racnoss, I give you one last chance. I can find
you a planet. I can find you and your children a place in the universe
to co-exist. Take that offer and end this now. <br>
EMPRESS: These men are so funny. <br>
DOCTOR: What's your answer? <br>
EMPRESS: Oh I'm afraid I have to decline. <br>
DOCTOR: What happens next is your own doing. <br>
EMPRESS: I'll show you what happens next. At arms! Take aim! And <br>
DOCTOR: Relax. <br>
(The robots slump.) <br>
DONNA: What did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: Guess what I've got, Donna? <br>
(A robot remote control.) <br>
DOCTOR: Pockets. <br>
DONNA: How did that fit in there? <br>
DOCTOR: They're bigger on the inside. <br>
EMPRESS: Roboforms are not necessary. My children may feast on Martian
flesh. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but I'm not from Mars. <br>
EMPRESS: Then where? <br>
DOCTOR: My home planet is far away and long since gone. But its name
lives on. Gallifrey. <br>
EMPRESS: They murdered the Racnoss! <br>
DOCTOR: I warned you. You did this. <br>
(He takes some Christmas tree decorations from another pocket.) <br>
EMPRESS: No! No! Don't! No! <br>
(The Doctor throws the baubles into the air then uses the remote to
direct them. He uses some to blow holes in the corridor wall to let the
Thames in, whilst the rest surround the Empress. Fires break out, and
manhole covers burst under the pressure. Water comes flooding into the
lair and down the hole. Alien screams come upwards.) <br>
EMPRESS: No! No! My children! No! My children! My children! <br>
DONNA: Doctor! You can stop now! <br>
EMPRESS: My children! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. Time I got you out. <br>
(Soaked to the skin, the Doctor and Donna head up the stairs.) <br>
EMPRESS: Transport me!

[Spaceship]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Empress is beamed up.) <br>
EMPRESS: Oh, they will suffer! So suffer! This planet shall be
scorched!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ladder]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DONNA: But what about the Empress? <br>
DOCTOR: She's used up all her Huon energy. She's defenceless!
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[London]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(An army tank rumbles down a street, then aims its
turret at the spaceship.) <br>
COMMANDER [OC]: Orders from Mister Saxon. Fire at will! <br>
SOLDIER: Fire! <br>
(Missiles pound the spaceship, which falls to pieces then explodes over
Canary Wharf.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Thames Barrier]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor and Donna stand on gate 8.) <br>
DONNA: Just there's one problem. <br>
DOCTOR: What is that? <br>
DONNA: We've drained the Thames.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the Nobles' home]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis is parked across the road.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we go. Told you she'd be all right. She can survive
anything. <br>
DONNA: More than I've done. <br>
(He gives her a quick sonic scan.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, all the Huon particles have gone. No damage, you're fine. <br>
DONNA: Yeah, but apart from that, I missed my wedding, lost my job and
became a widow on the same day. Sort of. <br>
DOCTOR: I couldn't save him. <br>
DONNA: He deserved it. No, he didn't. I'd better get inside. They'll be
worried. <br>
DOCTOR: Best Christmas present they could have. <br>
(Sylvia and Geoff hug each other.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. I forgot you hate Christmas. <br>
DONNA: Yes, I do. <br>
DOCTOR: Even if it snows? <br>
(The Doctor makes the Tardis lamp turn yellow and fire off a bolt of
energy into the sky. Instant snow shower.) <br>
DONNA: I can't believe you did that! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, basic atmospheric excitation. <br>
DONNA: Merry Christmas. <br>
DOCTOR: And you. So, what will you do with yourself now? <br>
DONNA: Not getting married, for starters. And I'm not going to temp
anymore. I don't know. Travel. See a bit more of planet Earth. Walk in
the dust. Just go out there and do something. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you could always <br>
DONNA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Come with me <br>
DONNA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. <br>
DONNA: I can't. <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's fine. <br>
DONNA: No, but really. Everything we did today. Do you live your life
like that? <br>
DOCTOR: Not all the time. <br>
DONNA: I think you do. And I couldn't. <br>
DOCTOR: But you've seen it out there. It's beautiful. <br>
DONNA: And it's terrible. That place was flooding and burning and they
were dying, and you were stood there like, I don't know, a stranger.
And then you made it snow. I mean, you scare me to death. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
DONNA: Tell you what I will do, though. Christmas dinner. Oh, come on. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't do that sort of thing. <br>
DONNA: You did it last year. You said so. And you might as well,
because Mum always cooks enough for twenty. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, all right then. But you go first. Better warn them. And
don't say I'm a Martian. I just have to park her properly. She might
drift off to the Middle Ages. I'll see you in a minute. <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis, and the engines start up.) <br>
DONNA: Doctor! Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Blimey, you can shout. <br>
DONNA: Am I ever going to see you again? <br>
DOCTOR: If I'm lucky. <br>
DONNA: Just promise me one thing. Find someone. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't need anyone. <br>
DONNA: Yes, you do. Because sometimes, I think you need someone to stop
you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Thanks then, Donna. Good luck. And just be magnificent. <br>
DONNA: I think I will, yeah. Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, what is it now? <br>
DONNA: That friend of yours. What was her name? <br>
DOCTOR: Her name was Rose. <br>
(The Tardis starts to dematerialise, then shoots straight up into the
sky before vanishing.)</font> </p>
