planet on a large wall monitor with a thick golden frame.) <br>
TIME LORD: Are you are sure the Master knows? <br>
TIME LORD 2: The report on the Doomsday weapon is missing from our
files. Only he could have taken it. <br>
TIME LORD: Then we can use the Doctor to deal with this problem. <br>
TIME LORD 3: The Doctor resents his exile bitterly. Do you think he'll
co-operate with us? <br>
TIME LORD 2: I doubt it. We immobilised his Tardis, took away his
freedom to move in space and time. <br>
TIME LORD: Then we must restore his freedom for as long as it serves
our purpose.

dematerialization circuit.) <br>
JO: Doctor, why don't you give up? You've been working on that thing
for simply ages. <br>
DOCTOR: You know I can't give up, Jo. It's far too important. <br>
BRIGADIER: Still at it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Now don't you start. <br>
BRIGADIER: The latest field reports are in. Still no trace of the
Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I didn't expect there would be. No, his Tardis is working
again now. He could be anywhere in space and time. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, that's as maybe, Doctor, but I've got to keep on
looking. <br>
DOCTOR: You're wasting your time, Brigadier. <br>
(The telephone rings.) <br>
JO: Hello, Laboratory? Yes, he's here. Brigadier? <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, thank you. Lethbridge Stewart? Right. Send him into my
office. One of my agents thinks he's picked up a trace of the Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Your agents are always picking up traces of the Master. <br>
BRIGADIER: This agent happens to be particularly reliable, Doctor. I'll
let you what he says. If you're interested. <br>
(The Brigadier leaves.) <br>
JO: Ah. Now you've offended him. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, look what happened last time. The man they arrested
turned out to be the Spanish ambassador. Well, there you are. That's
done it. <br>
JO: Done what? <br>
DOCTOR: I've made myself a completely new dematerialization circuit.
One that'll bypass the Time Lords homing control. I hope. <br>
JO: You don't seriously think you'll get that thing working again, do
you? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. No, I've been doing all this work for fun. <br>
JO: I mean it's just a sort of hobby isn't it? A kind of game? <br>
DOCTOR: A game? <br>
JO: Well, what have you got in there anyway. A policeman? <br>
DOCTOR: Why not step inside and see for yourself?

out! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. That's because the Tardis is dimensionally transcendental.
<br>
JO: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It means that it's bigger inside than out. Now then. <br>
(The Doctor inserts the dematerialization circuit while the Tardis
doors close. Then the time rotor starts going up and down.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's impossible! <br>
JO: The doors have closed. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
JO: Doctor, let me out of here. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can't, Jo. I think we're taking off! <br>
JO: Well, stop it. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm trying to. Something's operating it by remote control. <br>

doors and let me out. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't, Jo. We've taken off. <br>
JO: All right, then. Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: At the moment we're nowhere. <br>
JO: Oh, don't be silly. We can't be nowhere. <br>
DOCTOR: We're outside the space time continuum. <br>
JO: What? <br>
(The Doctor turns on a scanner.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look. <br>
JO: What's happening? Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: I've no idea. We'll just have to wait until we emerge. <br>
(The psychadelia on the scanner is replaced by a planet.) <br>
DOCTOR: The planet Uxarieus. So that's our destination. <br>
JO: Very impressive, but can we go back to Earth now please? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jo. I just don't know. <br>
(On the planet, a large tank-like robot travels along, stopping
occasionally to survey the ground with a device on the end of an arm on
its rotating turret. It moves on and the Tardis materialises. Welcome
to an old Cornish china clay pit before they finished working it and
started turning it back into woodland.) <br>
JO: Is that supposed to be where we are? <br>
DOCTOR: That is where we are. <br>
JO: All right then. If we've landed on another planet, why don't you
open the doors? <br>
DOCTOR: Because the atmosphere out there might be poisonous, that's
why. I'll just check. <br>
JO: Well, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Is it what? <br>
JO: Is the atmosphere poisonous? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, it's quite healthy. Similar to Earth before the
invention of the motor car. <br>
JO: Look, Doctor, are you going to open the doors or not? <br>
DOCTOR: I can but try. <br>
(The Doctor succeeds.) <br>
JO: Thank you. (looks outside) Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: That's an alien world out there, Jo. Think of it. <br>
JO: I don't want to think of it. I want to go back to Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, do you realize how long I've been confined to one planet?
<br>
JO: All that talk of yours about travelling in time and space, it was
true. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course it was true! Before I was stranded on Earth, I
spent all my time exploring new worlds and seeking the wonders of the
universe. <br>
JO: But you don't know what's out there. <br>
DOCTOR: Then let's find out. Don't you want to set foot in another
world? <br>
JO: Well, yes, I do but I <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Come on. We'll just take a quick look around, and then
I'll try and get you back to Earth. All right? <br>
JO: All right.

(Jo picks up an alien flower.) <br>
JO: It's got different kinds of petals. <br>
(The Doctor goes to look at something else and Jo follows. We see that
they are being watched by a green figure carrying a spear.) <br>
JO: What are they? <br>
DOCTOR: They're tracks made by some sort of machine. This planet must
be inhabited after all. I think we'll get a better view from up there.
Come on, what are you waiting for? <br>
JO: I feel a bit scared. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Jo. Nothing to worry about. <br>
(As they walk up the slope, the figure goes over to the Tardis.) <br>
JO: Those things up there. <br>
DOCTOR: They look like some sort of prefabricated dwellings. Oh look,
there's another one. A small one up there. Let's go and take a look at
them. <br>
JO: Oh no, you don't. Let's get back to the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, all right. But, er, do you mind if I take a look at that
rock first? It's rather unusual. <br>

those creatures. We both did. <br>
ASHE: (dark hair) I surveyed this planet myself before the colony was
set up. <br>
MARTIN: Well, you didn't do much of a job. <br>
ASHE: And all the time we've been here, there's been no trace of any
hostile animal life. <br>
MARTIN: Well, there is now. <br>
MRS MARTIN: We heard this roaring in the middle of the night. When we
looked out, there it was. <br>
WINTON: (moustache only) What did it look like? <br>
MARTIN: It was enormous. Some kind of giant lizard. <br>
ASHE: You must have been having nightmares. <br>
WINTON: Did it do any damage? <br>
MARTIN: No, I fired a few shots and frightened it off. <br>
ASHE: Well, exactly. All right, Martin. David, how many men have you
got to spare? <br>
WINTON: About six. <br>
ASHE: Well, go over to Martin's dome and have a look, just in case. <br>
WINTON: Very well.

staircase to the right of the main door and what looks like furniture
stored to the left. Ashe enters from his office opposite the doorway.
The Doctor and Jo are brought in at gunpoint by Leeson and his wife
Jane.) <br>
ASHE: What the? Leeson, who's this? <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do? Well, I must say this is all most impressive. <br>
LEESON: We found these two in sector twenty seven. They say they're
explorers. <br>
ASHE: Where do they come from? <br>
DOCTOR: We come from Earth. <br>
LEESON: They were examining rock samples. They're mineralogists. It was
bound to happen. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, we are not mineralogists. And even if we were, why all
the hostility? It's a respectable profession. <br>
LEESON: Because we don't want our planet gutted. This is our world.
You've no right to be here. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, we've as much right to be here as anybody else. <br>
ASHE: This planet has been classified as suitable for colonisation.
Once your big mining combines move in, you'll reduce it to a galactic
slagheap. <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't you got laws to deal with this kind of thing? <br>
LEESON: Yes, there are laws. We can complain to Earth's government just
like all the others. By the time you'll get a final decision, the
planet's useless. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. Yes well, I can sympathize with you, gentlemen, but I
can assure you that I'm not working for anybody. <br>
ASHE: Then just why have you come here? <br>
DOCTOR: Pure chance. My spaceship developed a fault. I had to land
somewhere. <br>
ASHE: Can you show me your papers? <br>
DOCTOR: Papers? No, they're back in my spaceship. If you'd like to come
back there with me, I <br>
ASHE: I think it would be better if you spent the night here. We'll go
to your spaceship in the morning. <br>
JO: Oh, we don't want to put you to any trouble. <br>
ASHE: I'd rather you did as I say. Jane? <br>
JANE: Yes, John? <br>
ASHE: Show our two guests to the dining area. We'll fix up your
sleeping accommodation later. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, go with them. It's all right, Jo. I'll join you in a
moment. <br>
JO: All right. <br>
JANE: This way. <br>
(Jane and Jo leave. The Doctor is looking at a graph on the wall.) <br>
LEESON: What do you think you're up to! <br>
(Leeson rushes over to the Doctor with his rifle ready. The Doctor uses
his Venusian karate move to stop him and make him drop the weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: These are your crop records, I take it? <br>
ASHE: That's right, but I really don't see what it has to do with you. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a very poor showing, isn't it? Are you operating above
subsistence level? <br>
LEESON: We're surviving. Come on! <br>
ASHE: No, no, just a minute. I'd like to hear what he has to say. <br>
DOCTOR: Unless I'm very much mistaken, you've got far more to worry
about than mineralogists. <br>
ASHE: Just what do you mean by that? <br>
DOCTOR: Unless things improve radically, you're in grave danger of
starving to death. <br>

MARTIN: He thinks we're seeing things. You two had better watch out. It
could be you next. <br>
MRS MARTIN: Ashe will take care of things. <br>
(Jane ladles out some soup from a large pan on the stove.) <br>
JO: Is that the first course? <br>
JANE: It's the only course. Supplies are getting a bit low. <br>
MRS MARTIN: Things are bound to be difficult. <br>
JO: It's very nice. Thank you. <br>
JANE: I'd better get back to my husband. <br>
MARTIN: It's getting harder all the time. <br>
MRS MARTIN: At least it's better than being back on Earth. <br>
MARTIN: Oh, I don't know. Things weren't so bad there. <br>
MRS MARTIN: Weren't they? No room to move, polluted air, not a blade of
grass left on the planet and a government that locks you up if you
think for yourself. <br>
MARTIN: At least they fed you. This isn't exactly the Garden of Eden.
And Ashe said we could make it perfect. <br>
(Winton enters.) <br>
WINTON: Are you ready, Martin? We're going to look for your monsters.
Let's hope we find something. <br>
MARTIN: You may be sorry if you do. <br>
WINTON: We can skin it and you can use it for a rug. <br>

gets herself a bowl of soup. She sits next to Jo.) <br>

MARY: Is that what they're wearing on Earth now? <br>

LEESON: It isn't. These cover crops won't even start to grow. <br>
JANE: What about the other sectors? <br>
LEESON: Huh! It's even worse. <br>
JANE: Never mind, my dear. <br>
LEESON: We should never have come here. <br>

LEESON: What's the point of owning land if it won't grow a decent crop?

LEESON: Ashe knows we're beaten. He just won't admit it. Anyway, it
probably doesn't matter anymore. <br>
JANE: What do you mean? <br>
LEESON: Those people that I found this morning. Suppose they are spies
for one of the big mining combines. <br>
JANE: Ashe seemed to believe what they say. <br>

JANE: What was that? <br>
LEESON: I don't know. It must have been the wind. <br>
JANE: Even if the mining combines do come, they can't drive us out. We
were here first. <br>
LEESON: Can't they? It's happened before. <br>

brought your colonists to this planet just over a year ago. <br>

DOCTOR: You set up your main dome here, with all your subsidiary domes
around it. <br>
ASHE: That's right. I made a preliminary survey before I sent for the
others. <br>
DOCTOR: And you were convinced that this planet was suitable for
habitation, despite the exhaustion of the soil? <br>
ASHE: Well, worn out soil can be reclaimed, Doctor, as you well know.
We should have had subsidence crops within the year. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Should have. <br>
ASHE: The cover crop refuses to grow. We plant it, it shoots up and
then withers, again and again. There seems to be no reason for it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, in theory, you should have a bumper crop by now. <br>

MARY: The radio cut out while she was still talking. <br>
DOCTOR: Didn't you say you'd sent some men down there? <br>
ASHE: Yes, but to Martin's dome at the other end of the colony. Look,
get in touch with Winton. Tell him to get over to Leeson's dome as fast
as he can. I'll join him there. <br>

should not support a thriving colony. <br>
MARTIN: I suppose you're an expert in agriculture? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. <br>
MARTIN: Then why won't my crops grow? <br>

must track it down and overcome it. <br>

we first moved here. You must go now. <br>

used. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? Super-weapons usually are eventually. <br>
MASTER: Who knows? Maybe it was due to a degeneration of the life
strain. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And so the super race became priests of a lunatic
religion worshipping machines instead of gods. <br>
