answerphone. Rory it putting clothes from a suitcase into the washing
machine while Amy checks the fridge.)<br>
WOMAN [answerphone]: It's Lane's Opticians. Just reminding you your
reading glasses are ready for collection. Bye! <br>
AMY: Milk two months out of date. Yogurt. <br>

AMY: Eek! Don't ask. <br>

Except real life doesn't get much of a look in. <br>
AMY: What do we do? <br>
RORY: Choose? <br>
(The sound of a Tardis materialising.) <br>
AMY: Not today, though. <br>
RORY: Nah, not today. <br>
AMY [OC]: Every time we flew away with the Doctor, we'd just become
part of his life. But he never stood still long enough to become part
of ours. Except once. The year of the slow invasion. The time the
Doctor came to stay. <br>
(As Rory and Amy sleep, a black box appears downstairs and floats onto
a shelf.)

out of their bedroom window.) <br>
RORY: Dad, it's half past six in the morning. <br>
BRIAN: What are you doing lying around? Haven't you seen them? <br>
(He has one of the boxes, and there are lots of them scattered around
the street like three inch square black hailstones.) <br>
RORY: What are they? <br>
BRIAN: Nobody knows. They're everywhere. <br>
AMY: Well, where have they come from? Wait. <br>
(A man in a tweed jacket is sitting on top of a child's climbing frame
examining a box.) <br>
AMY: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Invasion of the very small cubes. That's new. <br>
(The BBC News channel provides information.) <br>
BBC NEWS: (Matthew Amroliwala) World leaders are appealing for calm. <br>
BBC NEWS: (Joanna Gosling?) After the global appearance of millions of
small cubes. Despite official warnings, people have been taking the
cubes from the streets into offices and homes. <br>
MATTHEW [on TV]: What are they? <br>
JOANNA [on TV]: Where do they come from? <br>
MATTHEW [on TV]: And why are they here? <br>
PROF BRIAN COX [on TV]: Well, they're certainly not random space
debris. They're too perfectly formed for that. Are they
extra-terrestrial in origin? Well, you'll have to ask a better man than
me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: All absolutely identical. Not a single
molecule's difference between them. No blemishes, imperfections,
individualities. <br>
BRIAN: What if they're bombs? Billions of tiny bombs? Or transport
capsules maybe, with a mini robot inside. Or deadly hard drives. Or
alien eggs? Or messages needing decoding. Or they're all parts of a
bigger whole. Jigsaw puzzles that need fitting together. <br>
DOCTOR: Very thorough, Brian. Very, very thorough. Well done. Stay
here. Watch these. Yell if anything happens. <br>
AMY: Doctor, is this an alien invasion? Because that's what it feels
like. <br>
RORY: There couldn't be life-forms in every cube, could there? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. And I really don't like not knowing. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Right, I need to use your kitchen as a lab. Cook up some cubes.
See what happens. <br>
RORY: Right, I'm due at work. <br>
DOCTOR: What? You've got a job? <br>
RORY: Of course I've got a job. What do you think we do when we're not
with you? <br>
DOCTOR: I imagined mostly kissing. <br>
AMY: I write travel articles for magazines and Rory heals the sick. <br>
RORY: My shift starts in an hour. You don't know where my scrubs are? <br>
AMY: In the lounge, where you left them. </font></p>

Ultimate force available. <br>
(And run up to a certain front door.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: All the Ponds, with their house and their
jobs and their everyday lives. The journalist and the nurse. Long way
from Leadworth. <br>
(The Doctor is sonicking a gizmo together.) <br>
AMY: We think it's been ten years. Not for you or Earth, but for us.
Ten years older. Ten years of you, on and off. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at you now. All grown up. <br>
(The front door is smashed down.) <br>
MAN: Clear! Trap one, kitchen secured. <br>
MAN 2: Trap three, back garden secured. <br>
(The rest of the squad are outside the patio doors. Rory is marched in
at gunpoint.) <br>
RORY: There are soldiers all over my house, and I'm in my pants. <br>
AMY: My whole life I've dreamed of saying that, and I miss it by being
someone else. <br>
(A woman enters the house.) <br>
KATE: All these muscles, and they still don't know how to knock. Sorry
about the raucous entrance. Spike in Artron energy reading at this
address. In the light of the last twenty four hours, we had to check it
out, and the dogs do love a run out. Hello. Kate Stewart, head of
scientific research at UNIT. And with dress sense like that. <br>
(She holds out a scanner, which shows two hearts beating in his chest.)
<br>
KATE: You must be the Doctor. I hoped it would be you. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, since when did science run the military, Kate? <br>
KATE: Since me. UNIT's been adapting. Well, I dragged them along,
kicking and screaming, which made it sound like more fun than it
actually was. <br>
DOCTOR: What do we know about these cubes? <br>
KATE: Far less than we need to. We've been freighting them in from
around the world for testing. So far, we've subjected them to
temperatures of plus and minus two hundred Celsius, simulated a water
depth of five miles, dropped one out of a helicopter at ten thousand
feet and rolled our best tank over it. Always intact. <br>
DOCTOR: That's impressive. I don't want them to be impressive. I want
them vulnerable with a nice Achilles heel. <br>
KATE: We don't know how they got here, what they're made of, or why
they're here. <br>
DOCTOR: And all around the world, people are picking them up and taking
them home. <br>
KATE: Like iPads have dropped out of the sky. Taking them to work,
taking pictures, making films, posting them on Flickr and YouTube.
Within three hours, the cubes had a thousand separate Twitter accounts.
<br>
DOCTOR: Twitter? <br>
KATE: I've recommended we treat this as a hostile incursion. Gather
them all up and lock them in a secure facility. But that would take
massive international agreement and co-operation. <br>
DOCTOR: We need evidence. The cubes arrived in plain sight, in vast
quantities, as the sun rose. So, what does that tell us? <br>
AMY: Maybe they wanted to be seen. Noticed. <br>
DOCTOR: Or more than that, they want to be observed. So we observe
them. Stay with them round the clock. Watch the cubes, day and night.
Record absolutely everything about them. Team cube, in it together. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Lounge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Four days. Nothing! Nothing! Not a single
change in any cube anywhere in the world. Four days, and I am still in
your lounge! <br>
AMY: You were the one who wanted to observe them. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I thought they'd do something, didn't I? Not just
sit there while everyone eats endless cereal! <br>
RORY: You said we had to be patient. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you! You, not me! I hate being patient. Patience is for
wimps. I can't live like this. Don't make me. I need to be busy. <br>
AMY: Fine! Be busy! We'll watch the cubes. <br>
(So the Doctor creosotes the garden fence, plays a little football,
mows the lawn and does something to their car.) <br>
DOCTOR: (keeping the football off the ground.) Ninety eight, ninety
nine, one hundred. Amy! <br>
(He also vacuums the house.) <br>
DOCTOR: Four million nine hundred ninety nine, five million. <br>
(He returns to the sofa.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's better. Nothing like a bit of activity to pass the time.
How long was I gone? <br>
RORY: Er, about an hour. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't do it. No. <br>
AMY: Where are you going? </font></p>

BRIAN: You told me to watch the cubes. <br>
DOCTOR: Four days ago. <br>
BRIAN: Ah! Doesn't time fly when you're alone with your thoughts? <br>
RORY: You can't just leave, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I can. Quick jaunt, restore sanity. Ooo, hey,
come if you like. <br>
BRIAN: They can't just go off like that. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't they? Can't you? That's how it goes, isn't it? <br>
RORY: I've got my job. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, Rory. The universe is awaiting, but you have a little
job to. <br>
RORY: It's not little. It's important to me. Look, what you do isn't
all there is. <br>
DOCTOR: I never said it was. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. Fine. I'll be back soon. Monitor the cubes. Call me.
I'll have the Tardis set to every Earth
news feed.<br>
JOANNA [on TV]: At the end of a week of cubic questions and theories,
but no answers, could this be the greatest stealth marketing campaign
in business history? And if it is, will those behind it ever come
forward and explain exactly what it's for?

provisionally safe, whatever that means, and Banksy and Damien Hirst
put out statements saying the cubes are nothing to do with them. And
the cubes, well, they're just here. Still. What's it been, nine months?
People are just taking them for granted. Maybe we'll never know why
they came. But anyway. I got to Laura's wedding. It was great. She's
here tonight, being as it's our wedding anniversary. We thought you

DOCTOR: Not dead. Dormant, maybe. <br>
AMY: Then why shut down? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I don't know. I need to think. I need some air.
Who has an underground base? Terrible ventilation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[By the Thames]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: The moment they arrived, I should have made
sure they were collected and burned. That is what I should have done. <br>
AMY: How? Nobody would have listened. <br>
DOCTOR: You're thinking of stopping, aren't you? You and Rory. <br>
AMY: No. I mean, we haven't made a decision. <br>
DOCTOR: But you're considering it. <br>
AMY: Maybe. I don't know. We don't know. Well, our lives have changed
so much. But there was a time, there were years, when I couldn't live
without you. When just the whole everyday thing would drive me crazy.
But since you dropped us back here, since you gave us this house, you
know, we've built a life. I don't know if I can have both. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
AMY: Because they pull at each other. Because they pull at me, and
because the travelling is starting to feel like running away. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not what it is. <br>
AMY: Oh, come on. Look at you, four days in a lounge and you go crazy. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not running away. But this is one corner of one country in
one continent on one planet that's a corner of a galaxy that's a corner
of a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating and
destroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond. And
there is so much, so much to see, Amy. Because it goes so fast. I'm not
running away from things, I am running to them before they flare and
fade forever. And it's all right. Our lives won't run the same. They
can't. One day, soon maybe, you'll stop. I've known for a while. <br>
AMY: Then why do you keep coming back for us? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you were the first. The first face this face saw. And
you're seared onto my hearts, Amelia Pond. You always will be. I'm
running to you, and Rory, before you fade from me. <br>
AMY: Don't be nice to me. I don't want you to be nice to me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, you do, Pond, and you always get what you want. They got
what they wanted. <br>
AMY: What? Who did? <br>
DOCTOR: The cubes. That's why they stopped. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[UNIT HQ]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Kate? Before they shut down, they scanned
everything, from your medical limits to your military response
patterns. They made a complete assessment of Planet Earth and its
inhabitants. That's what the surge of activity was. <br>
(The power cuts off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Problem with the power? <br>
KATE: Not possible. We've got back-ups. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
AMY: Doctor? Look. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
KATE: Why do they all say seven? <br>
(Every cube is showing the same number.) <br>
DOCTOR: Seven. Seven, what's important about seven? Seven wonders of
the world, seven streams of the River Ota, seven sides of a cube. <br>
AMY: A cube has six sides. <br>
DOCTOR: Not if you count the inside. <br>
(Clunk, six.) <br>
DOCTOR: It has to be a countdown. <br>
KATE: Not in minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: Why would it be minutes? Kate, we have to get humanity away
from those cubes. God knows what they'll do if they hit zero. Get the
information out any way you can. News channels, websites, radio, text
messages. People have to know that the cubes are dangerous. <br>
AMY: Okay, but why is this starting now? I mean, the cubes arrived
months ago. Why wait this long? <br>
DOCTOR: Because they're clever. Allow people enough time to collect
them, take them into their homes, their lives. Humans, the great early
adopters. And then, wham! Profile every inch of Earth's existence. <br>
KATE: Discover how best to attack us. <br>
DOCTOR: Get that information out any way you can. Go! <br>
KATE: Right. <br>
(The computers are still working.) <br>
DOCTOR: Every cube was activated. There must be signals, energy
fluctuations on a colossal scale, there must be some trace. There can't
not be. We need to think of all the variables, all the possibilities,
okay? Go, go, go, go, go! <br>
MATTHEW [on TV]: This is a national security alert. The Government
advises that members of the public dispose of all cubes. If there are
cubes inside your house, remove them immediately. <br>
(The number drops from five to four.)

here, as far as you can, and get back here before it hits zero. Dad,
could you go and get me a box of tape for dressings? It's just the

(The orderlies run into a goods lift with Do Not Use tape all over it.
Rory presses the button, the doors open again but it is empty. He goes
in and tries the floor buttons. The doors close. Rory touches the wall
opposite and it wibbles. He walks through and onto a spaceship in
geosyncronous
orbit above an Earth surrounded by clouds..) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMY: Doctor, please. You don't have to do this. <br>
KATE: She's right. You don't have to be in there. We can do this
remotely. <br>
DOCTOR: Remotely isn't my style. See you after. <br>
(The Doctor enters a cubicle as the number on the cube changes to two.
Then it goes to one rather quickly, and finally zero. Then it switches
off and opens its lid.) <br>
DOCTOR: Geronimo. <br>
KATE: What's happening? <br>
AMY: Well? What's in there? <br>
DOCTOR: There is nothing in here. <br>
AMY: Er, well, that's good. It's not, it's not bombs, it's not aliens. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? Why is there nothing inside? Why? It doesn't make any
sense. <br>
(The Doctor comes out of the cubicle and goes to the bespectacled
Researcher.) <br>
DOCTOR: Glasses, is it the same? Is it the same all around the world? <br>
KATE: They're empty. We're safe, right? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, no, no, no, we are very far from safe. All along, every
action has been deliberate. Why draw attention to the cubes if they
don't contain anything? <br>
AMY: Doctor, look. <br>
(On the monitors, people are clutching at their chests in pain as they
walk near cubes on the ground.) <br>
RESEARCHER: They're CCTV feeds from across the world. They're showing
the same. <br>
KATE: People are dying. <br>
DOCTOR: What? They can't be dying. How? How are they dying? <br>
KATE: I want information on how people are being affected. <br>
DOCTOR: The cubes brought people close together. They opened and then
argh! <br>
(The Doctor clutches his chest.) <br>
AMY: Doctor, what's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Argh. Ah, I don't know! <br>
RESEARCHER: Hospitals are logging a global surge in heart failures.
Cardiac arrests. <br>
DOCTOR: That's it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Only one heart. Other one's not working.
<br>
AMY: Okay, I'm going to get you to the hospital! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. Just a short circuit. Turn around, turn
around. Tell me, show me. Ten seconds after the cubes opened, show me
the patterns in their electrical currents. <br>
(A heartbeat.) <br>
DOCTOR: See? <br>
KATE: No! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the power cut. They zapped the power and then argh!
They're signal boxes. People leaning in, wham. Pure electrical surge
out of the cube targeted at the nearest human heart. The heart, an
organ powered by electrical currents, short-circuited. How to destroy a
human? Go for the heart. Ow.
Crikey Moses. <br>
KATE: Doctor, the scan you set running. The transmitter locations. It's
found them. <br>
DOCTOR: And look at them all, pulsing bold as brass. Seven of them, all
across the world. Ow! Seven stations, seven minutes. Why is that
important? Argh! Ow, ow. How do you people manage? One heart, it is
pitiful. A wormhole, bridging two dimensions. Seven of them hitched
onto this planet, but where's the closest one? Glasses, zoom in. <br>

needs your leadership right now. <br>
KATE: I'll do my best. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course you will. Good luck, Kate. Argh! Argh! <br>

DOCTOR: Ah. Soborian smelling salts. Outlawed in seven galaxies. <br>

at them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa! Whoa! What kind of a welcome do you call that? Get them
out of here. You too. Now! <br>
AMY: What are you going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely no idea. Get him to the portal. <br>
(Brian wakes as soon as they move his trolley. The alien shoots again.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Whoa! <br>
SHAKRI: So many of them crawling the planet, seeping into every corner.
<br>
(Amy, Rory and Brian leave. The alien vanishes then reappears in front
of a bank of monitors.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not possible. I thought the Shakri were a myth. A myth to
keep the young of Gallifrey in their place. <br>
SHAKRI: The Shakri exist in all of time, and none. We travel alone and
together. The Seven. <br>
DOCTOR: The Shakri craft, connected to Earth, through seven portals and
seven minutes. Ah, but why? <br>
SHAKRI: Serving the word of the Tally. <br>
DOCTOR: Why the cubes? Why Earth? <br>
SHAKRI: Not Earth, humanity. The Shakri will halt the human plague
before the spread. <br>
DOCTOR: Erase humanity before it colonises space. We thought the cubes
were an invasion. The start of war. <br>
SHAKRI: The human contagion only must be eliminated. <br>
(Rory and Amy return.) <br>
AMY: Who are you calling a contagion? <br>
DOCTOR: Oi! Didn't I tell you two to go? <br>
RORY: You should have learned by now. <br>
AMY: Yeah, and what is this Tally anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: Some people call it Judgment Day, or the Reckoning. <br>
AMY: Don't you know? <br>
DOCTOR: I've never wanted to find out. <br>
SHAKRI: Before the Closure, there is the Tally. The Shakri serves the
Tally. <br>
DOCTOR: The pest controllers of the universe, that's how the tales
went, isn't it? <br>
AMY: Wow. That's some seriously weird bedtime story. <br>
DOCTOR: You can talk. Wolf in your grandmother's nightdress? So, here
you are, depositing slug pellets all over the Earth, made attractive so
humans will collect them, hoping to find something beautiful inside.
Because that's what they are. Not pests or plague, creatures of hope,
forever building and reaching. Making mistakes, of course, every life
form does. But, but they learn. And they strive for greater, and they
achieve it. You want a tally. Put their achievements against their
failings through the whole of time, I will back humanity against the
Shakri every time. <br>
SHAKRI: The Tally must be met. The second wave will be released. <br>
AMY: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It's going to release more cubes to kill more people. </font></p>

AMY: He's gone? <br>
DOCTOR: He was never really here. Just the ship's automated interface,
like a talking propaganda poster. I can stop the second wave. I can
disconnect all the Shakri craft from their portals, leave them drifting
in the darkspace. Ah, but all those people who were near the cubes, so
many of them will have died. <br>
AMY: I restarted one of your hearts. <br>
RORY: You'd need mass defibrillation. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. Ah, beautiful. But, Ponds, Ponds. We are going to go
one better than that. The Shakri used the cubes to turn people's hearts
off. Bingo! We're going to use them to turn them back on again. <br>
AMY: Will that work? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, creatures of hope. Has to. <br>
(The Doctor finishes sonicking the alien computer.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thirty seconds. Don't let me down, cubes, you're working for me
now. Oh dear. All these cubes. There's going to be a terrible wave of
energy ricocheting around here any second. Run. <br>

DOCTOR: Dear me. I'd better get going. Things to do, worlds to save,
swings to swing on. Look, I know, you both have lives here. Beautiful,
messy lives. That is what makes you so fabulously human. You don't want
to give them up. I understand. <br>
BRIAN: Actually, it's you they can't give up, Doctor. And I don't think
they should. Go with him. Go save every world you can find. Who else
has that chance? Life will still be here. <br>
DOCTOR: You could come, Brian. <br>
BRIAN: Somebody's got to water the plants. Just bring them back safe. <br>
AMY [OC]: So that was the year of the slow invasion, when the Earth got
cubed, and the Doctor came to stay. It was also when we realised
something the Shakri never understood. What cubed actually means. The
power of three.
