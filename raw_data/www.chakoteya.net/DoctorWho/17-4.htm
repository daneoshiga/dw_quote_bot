RIGG: We seem to be ahead of schedule, Secker. <br>
(Secker has a silly grin on his face.) <br>
SECKER: Great. <br>
RIGG: What? <br>
SECKER: The sooner the better. <br>
RIGG: Oh. <br>

RIGG: Captain here. We're coming out of warp in thirty seconds. </font></p>

sunglasses, hooded silver jumpsuits and seated in rows of three seats,
airplane style. A pleasant female voice makes an announcement.) <br>
COMPUTER: This is your flight computer speaking. We are about to go
into orbit around the planet Azure. Passengers may leave their seats
when the blue light comes on, but are requested not to remove their
protective coveralls until instructed. Will passengers please remember
that the Empress will be at seven tenths G, so please be careful when
you first start to move around. Thank you. </font></p>

console.) <br>
RIGG: I've got a malfunction. Check it out, will you? <br>
(Secker just sits grinning to himself.) <br>
RIGG: Secker, these coordinates are wrong. Did you set these? <br>
SECKER: What's a few degrees? <br>
RIGG: What's a few degrees? What's the matter with you, man? We're
flying an interstellar cruise liner, not riding a bicycle! <br>
SECKER: So? <br>
RIGG: So we shall be going into the wrong orbit! <br>
SECKER: So? <br>
RIGG: Well, it could mean delays. It could. Oh. <br>
(Rigg tries to correct it himself, then suddenly a small red spaceship
appears right in front of them as they come out of warp.) <br>
RIGG: Oh no! <br>
(As the Empress solidifies, the red ship is stuck into her forward
section.) <br>
RIGG: Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is cruise liner Empress reporting
collision. Space collision on approach to Azure. </font></p>

joined as alarm bells ring. The taller one uses a hand-held
communicator.) <br>
RIGG [OC]: Damage control, report to the bridge. <br>
CREWMAN: The two ships are sticking straight through each other, sir. <br>
RIGG [OC]: Any blowouts? How's the pressure? <br>
CREWMAN: Everything's okay except we can't get through to some of the
passenger sections. They're blocked off. The hull of the other ship,
sir, is sticking right across the entrance to B deck. </font></p>

casualties? <br>
(Just static on the monitor.) <br>
RIGG: Have you got that damage report yet? Well? <br>
(Rigg hauls the grinning, stoned Secker out of his chair and takes his
place.) <br>
RIGG: Oh, it's all your fault, Secker. I'll carry the can. I'll lose my
job but you, you'll never work in West Galaxy again. Go on, check the
power, man. Come on, move yourself! This is an emergency! <br>

the red ship is clearly visible. The Doctor and Romana come out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
ROMANA: Fascinating. <br>
DOCTOR: Bit of a mish-mash. <br>
ROMANA: Why wasn't there an explosion? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, one of the ships must have been in dematerialised form
when it happened. Nasty. Could cause terrible problems. <br>
K9: Affirmative. The overlap areas are highly unstable, master. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Interfaces, I should say. <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
ROMANA: I don't think we should interfere. <br>
DOCTOR: Interfere? Of course we should interfere. Always do what you're
best at, that's what I say. Now, come on. </font></p>

pressure suit and carrying a helmet comes out of the airlock just
before Romana and the Doctor walk round the corner.) <br>
ROMANA: Who was that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
ROMANA: Shall we follow? <br>
DOCTOR: At our own pace. </font></p>

Captain.) <br>
DYMOND: What are you going to do about the damage to my ship? <br>
RIGG: Mister Dymond, I am concerned with my ship, my crew, and nine
hundred passengers. We're fully covered comprehensive on all third
party damage, so don't worry. <br>
DYMOND: I was involved in the most important job, and you just come
crashing in on me, then you tell me not to worry? What am I going to do
for a ship? <br>
RIGG: The Company will compensate you. Get in touch with your insurance
people! <br>
(The Doctor and Romana enter unnoticed.) <br>
DYMOND: Then I insist that you sign a document to the effect that this
collision was entirely your fault! <br>
RIGG: I can't do that! What were you doing there, anyway? You were
right in the middle of a launch and land window for commercial flights.
<br>
DYMOND: I was given complete clearance from Azure Control. You were off
course! <br>
DOCTOR: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. I'd say it was knock for knock,
wouldn't you? <br>
RIGG: What? Are you a passenger? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. We answered your mayday. I'm from Galactic Insurance
and Salvage. Been having a look around. This is my assistant, Romana.
I'm the Doctor. How do you do? <br>
RIGG: How'd you do. What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, K9? Well, a computer of sorts. <br>
RIGG: It looks more like a dog. Does he bark? <br>
DOCTOR: No. But he has been know to bite. Aren't we going to introduce
ourselves? <br>
RIGG: Oh, yes. My name's Rigg, Captain Rigg. <br>
DOCTOR: We just met. <br>
RIGG: Yes. Er, this is Mister Dymond, the owner of the other vehicle
involved in the, er, incident. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do. <br>
RIGG: Salvage, you say? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
RIGG: Yes, well, I can't discuss anything until I've spoken to the
Company. <br>
DOCTOR: What about a better idea? Why don't we try to separate the
ships? <br>
DYMOND: Impossible. <br>
DOCTOR: I like doing the impossible. <br>
ROMANA: If it's possible to get into the situation, theoretically it
should be possible to get out of it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you've spoilt it now. <br>
ROMANA: But look, at the time of the collision this ship was partially
dematerialised. <br>
DOCTOR: Therefore if we can recreate identical circumstances the ships
could be separated. <br>
ROMANA: It's just a question of exciting the molecules. Put your ship
on full thrust. <br>
DOCTOR: Then full reverse. <br>
ROMANA: Well, it's worked before, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: I preferred it when it seemed impossible. <br>
RIGG: Yes, well, it might work if I could get any power. <br>
DOCTOR: Are you pressing the right button? <br>
RIGG: Of course I am. <br>
DOCTOR: Can we switch on the wreck of the power unit? <br>
RIGG: Well, we could do, but it's dangerous. <br>
DYMOND: Worth a try anything to get out of this mess. <br>
RIGG: It could damage your ship. <br>
DYMOND: That's nice coming from someone who's just crashed into it.
I'll risk it. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, all right. Where's the power unit? <br>
RIGG: Secker'll show you. Secker, take the Doctor to the power unit. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. No, Romana, you stay here. I might need you. I'll take
K9. K9? K9? <br>
K9: Affirmative, master. Affirmative. <br>
(Secker, the Doctor and K9 leave.) <br>
RIGG: Well, Romana, why don't you and Mister Dymond wait in the lounge?
<br>
ROMANA: Right. <br>
RIGG: Just down the corridor on the right. <br>
(Romana and Dymond leave. Rigg goes to a monitor and calls up the
details of Galactic Salvage and Insurance. Formed London Earth 2068.
Liquidated 2096.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Secker stops grinning and leans against the
wall.) <br>
SECKER: You go down here to section five, then left into the
shuttlebay, and down to level B. You can't miss it. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on, I thought the idea was you'd show me. <br>
SECKER: I've told you, haven't I? What's the difference? I'm busy. <br>
(Secker walks off.) <br>
DOCTOR: How very odd. <br>
K9: Affirmative. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They follow Secker as he staggers into a darkened
area and watch as he uses a keycard to open a filing cabinet. He takes
out a small container and leaves. The Doctor enters, uses his sonic
screwdriver to open the cabinet and gets another container out. He
opens it and offers some of the contents to K9 on his hand for
analysis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Any idea what this is, K9? <br>
K9: A fungus. Source of the drug XYP. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
K9: Dangerous, addictive. Known as Vraxoin. <br>
DOCTOR: Vraxoin? I've seen whole communities, whole planets destroyed
by this. It induces a kind of warm complacency and a total apathy.
Until it wears off, that is, and soon you're dead. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Lounge]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A bespectacled man with a vaguely teutonic cum
slavic accent is holding forth to Romana. His female assistant stands
nearby.) <br>
TRYST: It is my ambition to become the first zoologist to qualify and
quantify every species in our galaxy. One more trip and I may achieve
it. <br>
ROMANA: Are you planning another? <br>
TRYST: Ah, well, the next is always on my mind, but is a question of
finance. I was hoping to meet a sponsor on Azure, but this accident may
have ruined my chances. <br>
ROMANA: A sponsor? <br>
TRYST: Yes, well, the government used to fund me, but the galactic
recession put a stop to that. Now all they do is to assign me special
travel facilities on government subsidised spacelines, but first class.
<br>
ROMANA: What's that machine? <br>
(A free standing object about a metre tall with a diamond shaped box on
the top.) <br>
TRYST: Ah, that is my CET machine. The Continuous Event Transmuter. It
is an invention of mine. I will show you. <br>
(He switches the machine on, and a whole wall sized screen set up a
little way forward of the end of the lounge lights up. It shows a
landscape with mountains in the distance, some trees and mist on the
ground.) <br>
ROMANA: It looks as if you've invented the cinematograph. <br>
TRYST: What you see may seem to be just a mere projection, but it is in
fact a matter transmutation. <br>
DELLA: You see, when we've collected the specimens for study, they're
converted into electromagnetic signals and stored on an event crystal
in the machine. <br>
TRYST: And they go on living and evolving. <br>
DELLA: In the crystal. <br>
TRYST: This image projection allows us to see them whenever we wish.
The flora and the fauna are actually in a crystal. I hope you can
appreciate what a technical achievement that is. <br>
ROMANA: A crude form of matter transfer by dimensional control. <br>
TRYST: Crude? <br>
ROMANA: Well, prototype. And you could have problems with it. <br>
TRYST: Problems? But it works perfectly. <br>
ROMANA: Nothing works perfectly. <br>
TRYST: Oh, yes, but <br>
ROMANA: What about the materialisation collision? It's caused all sorts
of unstable matter interface. They'll probably affect the dimensional
matrix of your machine. <br>
TRYST: The what? <br>
ROMANA: Have you thought of that? <br>
TRYST: Are you claiming superior knowledge? <br>
ROMANA: Equal, perhaps. <br>
DYMOND: I wish everyone would stop showing off and get something done
about my ship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> RIGG: We seem to have to have a slight problem,
Azure. We're doing out best to sort it out and meanwhile we'll continue
to orbit. Rigg out. <br>
(The Doctor harrumphs.) <br>
RIGG: Ah, Doctor. The man from Galactic. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
RIGG: Back so soon? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I'll tell you something about your man Secker. <br>
RIGG: What about him? <br>
DOCTOR: He ran away. <br>
RIGG: Yes, well, he has been behaving rather strangely. Seems to be in
a different world. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Perhaps he's unwell. Can I have a look at your log and
check to see if he's been to any planet where he might have picked up
Vraxoin? <br>
RIGG: Doctor, this is the milk run. Station nine to Azure, Azure to
Station nine. A straight charter for the whole season. <br>
DOCTOR: What about one of the passengers? One of them could have been
the carrier, so to speak. <br>
RIGG: No, Doctor. They've all had prevocation checks. The Azurian
authorities insist on it. <br>
DOCTOR: Anyone else? <br>
RIGG: Tryst. <br>
DOCTOR: Tryst? <br>
RIGG: Yes. A zoologist. He arrived at Station nine after a long
expedition with his equipment and he's looking for a holiday. <br>
DOCTOR: Where had he been? <br>
RIGG: Well, all over. Oh, but he's all right. We checked him over. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but I'd still like to know where he's been. <br>
RIGG: Yes, and I'd like to know just who you are. <br>
DOCTOR: Me? <br>
RIGG: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I told you. I'm from Galactic. <br>
RIGG: Galactic went out of business twenty years ago. <br>
DOCTOR: I wondered why I hadn't been paid. <br>
RIGG: Now that's not good enough. <br>
DOCTOR: That's what I thought. Where can I find Tryst? <br>
RIGG: Well, he's in the first class lounge. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good. Look, you try and find Secker and meet me in the
first class lounge and <br>
RIGG: Yes, and <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. Do you want this ship repaired or not? <br>
RIGG: Well, yes, of course I do. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, just find Secker and meet me in the lounge in five
minutes. <br>
RIGG: But I <br>

TRYST: We went through the Cygnus gap. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
TRYST: And then we did a slingshot over to a small system, just three
planets, M37. You know? <br>
DOCTOR: I do. <br>
TRYST: The second planet supports life in a very early stage of
evolution. The molluscs, the algae, the primitive insects. I can show
you. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, that's perfectly all right. I'm just interested in
the voyage. It's fascinating. <br>
TRYST: Here you are, a copy of my log. I published it to go with my
lectures. <br>
DOCTOR: The Volante. <br>
TRYST: Yes, the name of my ship. <br>
DOCTOR: And you invented this marvellous machine to collect your
specimens? You know, I knew a man once who toyed with an idea like
this. What was his name? Professor Stein? <br>
TRYST: Professor Stein? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
TRYST: Oh, a dear friend. He was my mentor. We worked on this idea
together before he died, of course. Then we stopped. You knew him? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, by reputation. He once gave a seminar on the <br>
DYMOND: Doctor, Doctor, Doctor. All very well reminiscing but don't we
have an urgent problem to deal with? I'm anxious to be on my way. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. You're extremely anxious to be on your way. <br>
DYMOND: Yes. You see, I didn't actually expect a spaceliner to
materialise halfway through my ship today. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
RIGG: Doctor, we can't locate Secker. My men are still looking. <br>
DOCTOR: Could you take me to the power unit yourself? <br>
RIGG: Well, yes, all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good. Tryst, thank you very much for your story. Very
interesting. We must have a chat about this machine of yours sometime. <br>
TRYST: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And about the notion of your capturing alien species for your
own private zoo. <br>
TRYST: Zoo? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
TRYST: No, Doctor, this is important scientific research. I am helping
to conserve endangered species. <br>
DOCTOR: By putting them in this machine? <br>
TRYST: Oh, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, of course. Just in the same way a jam maker conserves
raspberries. <br>
(The Doctor and Rigg leave.) <br>
ROMANA: Oh, don't mind him. He just likes to irritate people. <br>
(Romana picks up the copy of Tryst's log.) <br>
TRYST: Yes, well, he has a right to criticise. I suppose. Still, I'm
very pleased to have someone of intellect to speak with again, after
such a long voyage cooped up with all the same peoples. <br>
ROMANA: How many were on your ship? <br>
TRYST: Ah, well, to begin with there was ten, but we lost one. <br>
ROMANA: How? <br>

DOCTOR: No. K9 checked all the planets he'd been to. <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: None of them could explain Secker's condition. <br>
RIGG: Are you certain? <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely sure. <br>
(They round a corner to see the interface of the two ships.) <br>
RIGG: Oh dear. <br>
K9: Caution. Area of overlap is highly dangerous. Molecular structure
of the two ships is incompatible, causing matter interface. <br>
RIGG: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Fascinating. The two ships are rejecting each other.
Molecularly speaking, that is. <br>
RIGG: Like a tissue transplant, you mean. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Exactly. Is there another way to the power unit? <br>
RIGG: Well, we can try from below the shuttlebay. We'll have to cut our
way through. I could put in a request for lasers, have them sent up
from Azure. <br>
DOCTOR: That won't be necessary. I've got my own equipment. </font></p>

on the top from Bros to Ranx. Other choices available are Gidi, Eden,
Zil, Vij, Darp and Lvan. Another landscape appears, this time a plain
whose trees have round balls on the top. Gidi has a duststorm blowing.
Eden is a dark, dense, lush tropical forest with birdsong. Romana walks
forward. There is a human male partially concealed in the foliage. He
moves out of sight. Della enters the lounge.) <br>
DELLA: What are you doing? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I was just having a look. I hope you don't mind. <br>
(Della switches the machine off.) <br>
DELLA: I don't, no. <br>
ROMANA: Then why have you switched it off? <br>
DELLA: I don't mind. Tryst does. This machine's his baby. Nobody
touches it except for him. <br>
ROMANA: Has it ever gone wrong? <br>
DELLA: No. Why should it? <br>
ROMANA: Pff. Lots of reasons. Do you think I could just have a look at
that last one? Eden, I think it's called. <br>
DELLA: No, not that one. <br>
ROMANA: What's the matter? <br>
DELLA: It's just that Eden brings back such unpleasant memories for me.
That was where we lost the other crewmember. <br>

eighty three days here? <br>
STOTT: Yes. I thought I was going to be stuck here for the rest of my
life. There were a few times when I felt like blowing my brains out.
The hardest thing was being able to look out and see Della. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, quite. Tell me, when did you first discover you could
get out of the projection? <br>
STOTT: After the accident. Something must have gone wrong with the CET
machine. The edge of the projection was shimmering. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>
STOTT: I decided I had nothing to lose, so I walked straight through it
and found myself on the Empress. Then I took one of the passenger
coveralls so I could walk about unnoticed. <br>
DOCTOR: Why didn't you tell Tryst and Della you'd got out? <br>
STOTT: Because of what I am and what I'm doing. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>
STOTT: I'm a Major in the Intelligence section of Space Corps, on a
special assignment to find out who's drug running. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha. You thought it was me, didn't you. <br>
STOTT: For a while. Then I overheard you and Romana talking in the
lounge. <br>
ROMANA: Tryst thought it was you, and now he thinks it's Della. <br>
STOTT: Tryst's a fool. He knows nothing. He didn't even realise his
expedition was being used to transport a new sort of Vrax that someone
had found. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, if you store in on crystal in the CET machine, it can't
possibly show up on a molecular scan. <br>
STOTT: He must have arranged somewhere along the line for a pick-up.
They'd have to get the stuff out of the projection and pass it on. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. You've got the stuff I had? <br>
STOTT: Just a tiny sample. Secker must have found it. He may even have
been involved himself. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but more important is where the main supply is hidden and
where it comes from. <br>
STOTT: All I know is that it's in Eden somewhere. I've been searching
all this time. No result. <br>
DOCTOR: Then we've got to get the dimension projection sealed off
again, which means doing what we first came to do. <br>
STOTT: And what's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Separate the ships. Tell me, if we go out of the projection in
that direction, do we come to the power unit? <br>
STOTT: Yes, you can get out of the projection any way you want. <br>

ROMANA: Oh, we've got far more sophisticated stuff in the Tardis. Do it

STOTT: What about the mandrels and the Vraxoin? <br>
DOCTOR: The mandrels have a perfect right to exist. In one way Tryst
was right. Humans do have some kind of choice. Let's just hope that no
one else discovers the secret. <br>
ROMANA: I can only think of one animal who'd be comfortably at home in
an electric zoo. <br>
DELLA: Really? What's that? <br>
ROMANA: I don't think we want to tell them, do we, K9? <br>
K9: Negative, mistress. </font> </p>
