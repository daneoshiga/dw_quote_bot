</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis has materialised in mid-air just
offshore, and set itself down gently on the water. The Doctor, Jamie
and Victoria use a rubber dinghy to row to the shingle beach nearby.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. Come one, Victoria, out you get. <br>
JAMIE: Trust you to bring us right down in the middle of the sea. <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis is perfectly capable of floating you know. <br>
VICTORIA: Where are we exactly? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh England, undoubtedly. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, you can tell by the weather. <br>
DOCTOR: And the white cliffs. <br>
VICTORIA: We always seem to land on this planet. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, it's always England. I think by the hammering the Tardis
has got, you've gone and spiked it. Hey, where are you going? <br>
(Something further along the beach has caught the Doctor's attention.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey what's all this stuff Doctor? <br>
VICTORIA: Foam, you silly. You often get it on the sea shore. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, but not in big lumps like this, hey Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not usually, Jamie. (He scoops some up.) Hey Jamie, feel
that. <br>
(The Doctor pushes the foam into Jamie's face.) <br>
JAMIE: Right. <br>
(And the three have a foam fight up the beach. Then Jamie sees
something further along.) <br>
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, what's that? May be that's where the foam's coming
from. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I hardly think so, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Well, let's go and see. <br>
(They come to a large steel pipe which curves up out of the sand and
into the face of the cliff.)<br>
JAMIE: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's just what it says, Jamie. It's EuroSea Gas. <br>
JAMIE: Gas from the sea? Oh, who are you trying to kid? <br>
VICTORIA: So it's nothing to do with the foam then. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I shouldn't think so. I wonder what that is? <br>
(The Doctor peers at a large black metal box fastened to the pipe, then
tries to open it.) <br>
JAMIE: Will it not budge? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it won't touch it, I'm afraid, Jamie. Ah well, have to use
this. <br>
JAMIE: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a sonic screwdriver. Never fails. <br>
(The Doctor activates the wand-like device and the screws unwind
themselves out of the box.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we are. Neat isn't it? All done by sound waves. Now, what
have we got here. Oh yes. <br>
JAMIE: What is it? What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, Jamie. <br>
(The Doctor closes the box, gets a stethoscope from his pockets and
listens to the pipe. It sounds like a heart beat.) <br>
VICTORIA: I can hear it too. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It's probably only throbbing from a pump, you know. <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor, please hurry up. I don't like this place. It's so
quiet. I feel as if we're being watched. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, Victoria. Now then, Jamie. <br>
(They are being watched, through the telescopic sight of a remotely
controlled rifle which is relaying the image to a television screen.
The rifle moves to put its cross-hairs on the Doctor. The Doctor is
shot in the shoulder, and falls.) <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor! <br>
(Jamie and Victoria are also shot.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Victoria wakes. She is lying on the floor of a
brightly lit room with two armed guards standing over her.) <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor? Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Victoria? Jamie, you there? <br>
JAMIE: Oh, I think so. <br>
VICTORIA: I can't move. My legs. <br>
JAMIE: What happened?? What do you want? <br>
DOCTOR: Would someone kindly tell us where we are, please? Why don't
you answer? <br>
JAMIE: Come on, where are we? <br>
VICTORIA: What have they done? Can't move. <br>
DOCTOR: I think we've been tranquillised, Victoria. <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Tranquillised. <br>
JAMIE: Who do they think they are? <br>
ROBSON: We should be the ones asking the questions. I shall expect
quite a lot of answers. <br>
JAMIE: What is this place? <br>
ROBSON: You mean you don't know? <br>
JAMIE: If only I could just get up. <br>
ROBSON: I wouldn't try if I were you. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, in this position it's just a little difficult to
communicate. <br>
HARRIS: Shall we give them some U4, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? <br>
ROBSON: Yes, do that Mister Harris. <br>
JAMIE: What's U4? <br>
VICTORIA: Oh no. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's all right, I think it's the antidote. <br>
VICTORIA: No, please. <br>
DOCTOR: Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, you know. Oh yes,
thank you. Yes, that's better, thank you. Thank you very much. Yes. <br>
(Revived by the antidote gas, the travellers stand.) <br>
ROBSON: You were on the beach by the pipe line, in a restricted area.
Now why? <br>
VICTORIA: We were lost, that's all. <br>
ROBSON: You were tampering with the emergency release valve remote
control. You're a saboteur. <br>
VICTORIA: He's not. He's a doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I can assure you. I was only being curious. <br>
HARRIS: I don't really think how they could have anything to do with
the fall in pressure <br>
ROBSON: When I want your opinion, Harris, I'll ask for it. In the
meantime, lock them up in one of the cabins. I'll interrogate them
later. And you lot, get back to work. <br>
JAMIE: Is he always as charming as that? <br>
HARRIS: We're in something of an emergency at the moment. You see,
we've just lost contact with one of our rigs at sea. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean communications have broken down? <br>
HARRIS: No, that's what's curious about it. As far as we can tell our
video link is functioning normally. The crew just aren't answering. <br>
VICTORIA: You can't blame us for that, surely. <br>
HARRIS: There's also been a drop in pressure in the feed lines from the
rigs. You were seen tampering with a release valve on the pipe line. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you I was merely being curious. <br>
HARRIS: Were you? <br>
JAMIE: Are you calling us liars? <br>
HARRIS: No, but you must admit your sudden appearance here inside our
restricted area is suspicious. <br>
VICTORIA: That's no reason to shoot us down like animals. <br>
HARRIS: Maybe not, but we were under a security alert and Mister
Robson's, well. under considerable pressure himself. I'm sorry but I
shall have to do as he says and lock you up. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear. <br>
HARRIS: Would you follow me? Come along, this way. <br>
(Harris leads the way and the two armed guards follow. A warning light
starts to glow on a control panel.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Harris's wife is stopped from leaving.) <br>
GUARD: May I see your pass please, madam? <br>
MAGGIE: Pass? <br>
GUARD: I have instructions that no one is to leave or enter the
compound without a written pass from Chief Robson. Not until after the
emergency. <br>
MAGGIE: But you know who I am. My husband is second in command to Chief
Robson. <br>
GUARD: Yes Mrs Harris, I know. <br>
MAGGIE: Then let me pass. Please. <br>
GUARD: Sorry, madam. I think you should return to the residential
block.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Crew bunk room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HARRIS: I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do to
help you until you tell me what you were doing with that release valve
on the pipe line. <br>
DOCTOR: It wasn't the valve I was interested in. <br>
HARRIS: Oh? <br>
DOCTOR: I heard a movement coming from inside the pipes. <br>
HARRIS: A movement? (to guard) Oh, it's all right. You can go. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, movement. Don't ask me what it was. <br>
HARRIS: Well, I'm not sure what you re trying to suggest, but I can
assure you marine life couldn't possibly get inside the pipe line tube.
It would never get pass the drill pumps. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, that's as maybe, but there was something inside that tube
because I heard it too. <br>
VICTORIA: And so did I. <br>
DOCTOR: But if the pressure is down in the pipes, perhaps that's the
reason why? Perhaps marine life has got into the pipes. <br>
HARRIS: But that's impossible. We spent years of time, money and
research into perfecting our emergency system. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps there's a fracture in the pipes. A break, and
something's got in that way. <br>
HARRIS: Oh, I doubt it. <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Harris, I don't wish to appear interfering but don't you
think it'd be a good idea to turn off the gas? At least until you've
had a chance to check. <br>
HARRIS: Chief Robson would never agree to that. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
HARRIS: Well, he doesn't believe in working to the book. He prides
himself that the flow has never been shut off ever since he took
charge. <br>
DOCTOR: He sounds a very silly man. <br>
HARRIS: But he appears to be right about one thing. You seem to know
quite a lot about our business. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRICE: Chief? <br>
ROBSON: Yes? <br>
PRICE: We've gained contact with Rig D. Come in, Rig D. Come in,
please. Rig D, can you hear me please? <br>
(There is interference on the signal.) <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: Yes. Rig D to HQ. I can hear you. <br>
ROBSON: Carney? What the dickens is going on out there? <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything's quite all right, Mister Robson. <br>
ROBSON: What? <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: We have the situation under control. <br>
ROBSON: Will you speak up, man. I can't hear a word you're saying. <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: Don't worry. <br>
ROBSON: Price, are we losing volume? <br>
PRICE: No, sir. I don't understand it. Will you speak a little louder,
Mister Carney? <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything is under control. <br>
ROBSON: Carney? What happened to the emergency crew we sent you? Have
they arrived yet? <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: Yes. Yes. But they must stay here for the time
being. <br>
ROBSON: They what? <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: We've had a slight accident. Two men out of
action. <br>
ROBSON: Now listen, Carney. You get that rig fixed A1 and quick. <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: But it will take some time. <br>
ROBSON: What? What did you say? What's wrong with this thing. <br>
PRICE: I don't know, sir. It must be their end. He seems to be
whispering. <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything's under control. <br>
ROBSON: Carney, speak up man! <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything's under control. <br>
ROBSON: Carney! <br>
CARNEY [on monitor]: Everything's under control. <br>
ROBSON: Carney! <br>
PRICE: I think we've lost contact again, sir. <br>
ROBSON: Well fix it, man. <br>
(Harris enters.) <br>
ROBSON: Price is getting too old for his job. <br>
HARRIS: Mister Robson, I think we should turn off the gas flow coming
from the rigs and make a check. <br>
ROBSON: You think what, Mister Harris? <br>
HARRIS: That Doctor chap, the stranger. He said he heard a movement
coming from inside the pipe line on the beach. <br>
ROBSON: Oh, did he now. Did he say what he thought it was? Mice? <br>
CHIEF: Chief? She's down a further three. Pressure's on just one fifty
seven. <br>
ROBSON: One fifty seven? Are you sure? <br>
CHIEF: Yes, sir. <br>
HARRIS: That means the gas flow pressure is down at the rate of three
percent every <br>
CHIEF: Twenty minutes. <br>
HARRIS: Doesn't this prove that something must be blocking the pipe
line? <br>
ROBSON: It proves nothing of the sort. It's probably a faulty gauge,
that's all. Check it. <br>
HARRIS: Look, at least give us the benefit of the doubt. <br>
ROBSON: When you want to find out about pipe lines and rigs Mister
Harris, the thing to do is to go out to sea and work on them. <br>
HARRIS: Look, I'm merely saying that if something had got into the tube
then we should check <br>
ROBSON: You let me worry about that. <br>
HARRIS: But Mister Robson, please listen. Look, this ties up with what
I've been trying to tell you. For three weeks now, there's been a
regular and increasing build up of fall in pressure. Look, I think you
should at least look at my calculations. The time ratio of the
increases and falls corresponds to form a definite progressive pattern.
<br>
ROBSON: So? <br>
HARRIS: I'll get them. <br>
(There is an open briefcase nearby.) <br>
ROBSON: What are you trying to prove, Harris? That I don't know my job?
<br>
HARRIS: No, sir, just that I do know mine. It's your decision whether
to take notice of my work but I must put it on record that I have
offered the information. <br>
(A white gloved hand takes some papers from the briefcase.) <br>
ROBSON: Don't threaten me, boy. I've eaten upstarts like you for
breakfast. You think you can baffle me with your little bits of paper,
don't you. All right, you go ahead and get them and I'll show you where
you've gone wrong. <br>
(Harris goes to get the file.) <br>
ROBSON: Did you make a thorough check? <br>
CHIEF: Yes, I checked it. Seems to be working properly. <br>
HARRIS: It's gone. <br>
CHIEF: Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her. <br>
HARRIS: It's gone. The file's gone. <br>
ROBSON: Well, well, well. Has it now. <br>
HARRIS: I'm sure I put it in here this morning. I must have left the
file on my desk at home. I'll go home and get it. <br>
ROBSON: You won't. You'll stay here. I'm not doing your job as well as
my own. <br>
HARRIS: What's the matter, sir? Are you scared that I might prove you
wrong? <br>
ROBSON: No, you go ahead. But you'd better have something more than a
high flown theory, because if you haven't I'm going to take you and
chop you up into little pieces and throw you back to your crummy little
university. All right? </font></p>

JAMIE: All clear. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you think you can make it? <br>
JAMIE: Of course I can make it. Hold on. <br>
VICTORIA: Don't bother, Jamie. I can do it with this. <br>
JAMIE: Pick a lock with A hair pin? Don't be daft. <br>

security. I'm just coming to find you to get a pass. <br>
HARRIS: Yes, there's been a bit of a flap on. <br>
MAGGIE: Well can I have a pass? <br>
HARRIS: Not at the moment. Look, could you do something for me? <br>
MAGGIE: Yes, what is it? <br>
HARRIS: There's a file. It's probably in the middle drawer of my desk
in the study. Could you get it and bring it to me at the control room? <br>
MAGGIE: All right, darling. What's the panic? <br>

(She finds the file in a different drawer than Harris said. It has
something inside it. Maggie opens it and drops it when she is stung.) <br>

(She carefully picks up the file and the seaweed, then goes to the
garden door and throws the seaweed onto the patio. Unnoticed, the

ROBSON: Restless? What are you talking about? <br>
VAN LUTYENS: You lost contact with Rig D, didn't you? <br>
ROBSON: Yes. It was only a temporary fault. We regained contact within
the hour. <br>
VAN LUTYENS: Well, why didn't you tell us that? Unusual incidents like
that only cause tension on the rigs. <br>
ROBSON: Don't tell me what happened out on the rigs. I spent four years
on one of those things without a break. <br>

JAMIE: Oh, how can it move. It's not a living thing, is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Everything in the sea is living, Jamie. <br>
VICTORIA: Well, it did move. It gave me a shock. It was like a spider. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we're not taking any chances. Hold that for me, will
you? <br>
JAMIE: What's this for? <br>
DOCTOR: We're going to take a closer look at this weed. Now bring the
bag down here. Right onto the floor. That's it. Now don't let it touch
your fingers. Careful. Slowly does it. Mind your fingers. There. <br>
JAMIE: What are you going to do with it? <br>
DOCTOR: We're going to see if an ordinary piece of seaweed really can
move. <br>
HARRIS: Doctor, my wife, will she be all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I think so, yes. I don't think there's any panic, but
I'd get her under medical supervision if I was you. <br>
HARRIS: Yes, I'll go back to the Medicare centre at the compound and
arrange for her to be taken in there. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you do that. <br>

JAMIE: Aye. Hey! I thought we were supposed to be prisoners? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so did I. We better make the most of it. We've got a lot

something very strange going on here, but he refuses to accept the new

VAN LUTYENS: We have lost contact with two rigs. We have a major
blockage in the main pipeline. The impeller is jammed, and we still
don't know what is causing the trouble. <br>

everything was under control. <br>

(They suddenly loose height, heading back to the rig. The Doctor
narrowly avoids a crash.) <br>
PILOT [OC]: Stick back. Stick back. Nose down a bit. Go on. Right pedal
down. Right rudder. <br>
(It's the pilot of the other helicopter to the rescue.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right rudder. <br>
PILOT [OC]: Not too much, not too much. Try and keep the nose on the
horizon. That's better. Okay. Okay. Now too much. Stick back! Stick
back! Stick back, you want to come up now. Come on, you're getting too
near the water. Much too near the water. Stick back. Stick back. That's
better. Pull her up! Stick back! Stick back quickly! To the right.
You're about to hit the water. That's right. Now try and keep
everything centralised. Okay, now pull her up. Stick back! Stick back!
Quickly, stick back, stick back! Now try and keep the control central. <br>
(The Doctor finally gets his helicopter under a semblance of control.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you so much. Oh, just one thing. I've got it up all
right and it should be comparatively simple to propel it forward.
However, how do I land it?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HARRIS: It's no good. We won't hear from the Doctor
or any of them. We must evacuate the compound. <br>
JONES: No! We said an hour. He's got ten more minutes. <br>
HARRIS: But even if he does come back, what good could he do? The only
possible weapon we might have used against the weed has been destroyed.
<br>
JONES: That was your entire stock of oxygen, was it? <br>
HARRIS: Yes. <br>
JONES: Right. Perkins, get onto London to the Defence Minister. I want
a full red alert on this now. Tell him what's happened and ask him to
arrange for as many tankers of oxygen as he can muster to be sent here
immediately. <br>
PERKINS: Yes, Miss Jones. <br>
HARRIS: They won't be in time. We must evacuate the compound. The
pipeline room is a mass of weed and foam. You've seen how rapidly it
reproduces. It could swamp the entire compound at any moment. <br>
JONES: It could, but it hasn't yet, and until it does, we stay here. <br>
HARRIS: And when it does attack, how do you expect to fight it? With
what weapons? <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps I can answer those questions, Mister Harris. <br>
JONES: Doctor! Oh, thank heavens you're alive. <br>
HARRIS: What about Robson? Did you find him? <br>
JAMIE: Aye, we found him all right. <br>
HARRIS: And my wife? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we didn't see her, no. <br>
HARRIS: No. There's not much hope, is there. What can we do? How can we
fight this hideous thing? <br>
DOCTOR: You say there's not much hope. I believe there is. <br>
HARRIS: But even if we succeed in fighting of the weed, what about
those people already affected by it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well on our way back here we stopped of at the Medicare Centre.
The man that Jamie fought with in the corridor has almost completely
recovered. <br>
HARRIS: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, the weed growth on his arm has disappeared and died. He's
bemused, he's dazed, but he's alive! <br>
HARRIS: But how? Why? What killed the weed? <br>
DOCTOR: Noise! Sound vibrations. <br>
JONES: How did you find out? <br>
DOCTOR: Victoria discovered it. <br>
VICTORIA: I did? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, yes. You screamed. <br>
VICTORIA: I screamed. <br>
DOCTOR: It's her scream, her particular pattern of sound that does the
trick. <br>
HARRIS: So that's why the crews on the rigs spoke softly. The noise
affected them. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, very possibly. Now, before you evacuate this compound,
just give me one half hour. <br>
HARRIS: The risk is too great. The entire compound is alive with
seaweed. <br>
JONES: Half an hour won't make that much difference. Doctor, what do
you think we can do? <br>
DOCTOR: We make a noise, Miss Jones. We make an awful lot of noise! <br>
HARRIS: It's too late. We'll never stop it now. <br>
DOCTOR: But we've got to. It may be too late. <br>
HARRIS: It's impossible, I tell you. It's seeping in from every corner
of the compound. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but if we can destroy the weed's nerve centre. <br>
JONES: But you said yourself you don't know where the nerve centre is. <br>
DOCTOR: But we do. It's here. <br>
HARRIS: That's the Control Rig. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. We must generate enough sound to penetrate the
Control Rig. <br>
JONES: But how will you get it there? <br>
DOCTOR: That way. Through the pipelines. Mister Harris, this is the
only way to help your wife and all those other people. <br>
HARRIS: Yes, I realise that, but there isn't time. <br>
DOCTOR: Please. Just one half hour. <br>
HARRIS: Price. <br>
PRICE: Sir. <br>
HARRIS: What's happening in the pipeline room? <br>
(A monitor is switched on.) <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, no. <br>
PRICE: Half an hour? <br>
HARRIS: Yes, that's about all we've got. But you're right. We must try.
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Now then, Mister Price, where do all these big
leads go to? <br>
PRICE: The transmitter and loud speakers down below, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. <br>
PRICE: What's this all about, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if we can boost this equipment to transmit enough sound
down the pipeline, we can destroy the weed's nerve centre. <br>
JONES: But do you think this idea will work? <br>
DOCTOR: Have you got a tape recorder or some such thing? <br>
PRICE: Yes, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Victoria, I want you to scream. <br>
VICTORIA: Scream? <br>
DOCTOR: He will record it. Make a loop of it so that we can repeat it
endlessly. <br>
PRICE: Right, sir. What have we got here? <br>
JONES: I hope he knows what he's doing. <br>
JAMIE: Of course he does. I think. <br>
CHIEF: Mister Harris, the impeller shaft. You men, quick! <br>
JONES: Oh come on, Doctor.

VICTORIA: Jamie, you can't scream just like that! <br>
DOCTOR: Everything depends upon you screaming. <br>
(Victoria screams.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you are. I knew you could. <br>

the foam burst out of the impeller room airlock and start to flood the

DOCTOR: Keep away from it! Keep away! <br>
CHIEF: Shut those doors! <br>
HARRIS: Quick, this way.<br>

impeller room door closed. The trapped technicians fall victim to the
foam and weed.) <br>
HARRIS: All release valves open! Quick! <br>
JONES: What are you doing, man? <br>
HARRIS: I'm going to save the lives of an awful lot of people, Miss
Jones. Close feed lines one to six! Come on, man! <br>
JONES: You mean you're giving up? You're evacuating? <br>
HARRIS: Open your eyes, Miss Jones. Can't you see what's happening?
We're gradually being strangled. I can't risk the lives of these men
here any longer. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a few more minutes, please, Mister Harris. The scream's
ready. <br>
HARRIS: Good! <br>
DOCTOR: And Mister Harris. <br>
HARRIS: All right, all right, what do you want us to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Now then, I've attached the speakers to the pipeline.
Victoria's scream will be put through this. <br>
HARRIS: What does that do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a little toy of my own. Together with the
amplifiers, yes, it should produce a sonic laser sound wave. <br>
JONES: You mean like a laser light beam? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, passing through the pipes. It'll destroy the nerve centre
of the weed. <br>
HARRIS: Yes, but will it destroy the weed here? <br>
DOCTOR: Well unfortunately no. No, we have to do battle with that
ourselves. <br>
HARRIS: How? <br>
DOCTOR: With these, Mister Price. <br>
PRICE: With what? <br>
DOCTOR: If the weed attacks us here, we simply point these at it and
hope for the best. Now, for heaven's sake, don't get in the way of the
speakers. The sound'll cut you to pieces. HARRIS: Look there! <br>
DOCTOR: Give me the other two. Let's set up another two. <br>
PRICE: What's the current? <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, no time to waste. <br>
HARRIS: Chief! Chief, quick! <br>

they give way. The weed creature is in the doorway.) <br>

frozen with fear.) <br>

writhing.) <br>

away. Soon it is almost totally clear.) <br>
