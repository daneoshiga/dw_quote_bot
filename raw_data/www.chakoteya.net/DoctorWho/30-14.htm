<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises under a nice mediaeval
archway, in the falling snow. The Doctor steps out and smiles, and
walks into a busy Victorian market where sellers are calling out their
wares. The policeman on the beat acknowledges the Doctor.) <br>
POLICEMAN: Good afternoon. <br>
SELLER: Hot chestnuts. Chestnuts. <br>
CHOIR: Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy. Oh, tidings <br>
(The Doctor does his Ebenezer Scrooge impression.) <br>
DOCTOR: You there, boy. What day is this? <br>
BOY: Christmas Eve, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: What year? <br>
BOY: You thick or something? <br>
DOCTOR: Oi. Just answer the question. <br>
BOY: Year of our Lord 1851, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Nice year. Bit dull. <br>
ROSITA [OC]: Doctor! Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Who, me? <br>
(He runs towards the call.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSITA [OC] Doctor! <br>
(He finds a dark-skinned young woman.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, don't worry. Stand back. What have we got here?
(The large double doors in the wall move and something snarls behind
it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo. Okay, I've got it. Whatever's behind that door, I think
you should get out of here. <br>
ROSITA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. I'm standing right here. Hello. <br>
ROSITA: Don't be stupid. Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. <br>
ROSITA: Doctor who? <br>
ROSITA: Just the Doctor. <br>
ROSITA: Well, there can't be two of you. <br>
(Another man runs up.) <br>
ROSITA: Where the hell have you been? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Right then. Don't worry. Stand back. What have we got here
then? <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on. Who are you? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. Simply, the Doctor. The one, the only and
the best. Rosita, give me the sonic screwdriver. <br>
DOCTOR: The what? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Now quickly, get back to the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Back to the what? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: If you could stand back, sir. This is a job for a Time
Lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Job for a what lord? <br>
(The doors burst open and an animal with Cyberman-style head is
visible.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's different. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, that's new. <br>
(They both point their screwdrivers at it.) <br>
TOGETHER: Allons-y. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: I've been hunting this beast for a good fortnight. Now
step back, sir. <br>
(The beast leaps and lands way up the opposite wall. It has a furry
body and metal hands and feet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Some sort of primitive conversion, like they took the brain of
a cat or a dog. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Well, talking's all very well. Rosita? <br>
ROSITA: I'm ready. <br>
(Rosita hands over a large coil of rope.) <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Now, watch and learn. <br>
(The rope is a lasso, and this Next Doctor gets it around the beast in
one try.) <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Excellent. Now then, let's pull this timorous beastie down
to earth. <br>
(The beast climbs higher, pulling him up with it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Or not. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: I might be in a little bit of trouble. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing changes. I've got you. <br>
(But the beast is strong enough to pull the pair of them off the
ground.) <br>
ROSITA: You idiots! <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Perhaps if you could pull? <br>
DOCTOR: I am pulling. In this position, I couldn't not pull, could I? <br>
(The beast leaps through a window into the top floor of the warehouse.)
<br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Then I suggest you let go, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not letting you out of my sight, Doctor. Don't you
recognise me? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: No, should I? Have we met? This is hardly the right time
for me to go through my social calendar. Argh! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Warehouse]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The beast pulls them in through the window.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa! <br>
(And across the dusty floor, on their bottoms, to the opposite window.)
<br>
DOCTOR: It's going to jump! <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: We're goanna fall! <br>
(The beast leaps through the window. Rosita cuts the rope with a big
axe. The sore men get up and the Next Doctor starts laughing. Then they
hug.) </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSITA: Well, I'm glad you think it's so funny.
You're mad. Both of you. You could've got killed. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: But evidently we did not. Oh, I should introduce Rosita.
My faithful companion. Always telling me off. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they do, don't they? Rosita. Good name. Hello, Rosita. <br>
ROSITA: Huh. Now I'll have to go and dismantle the traps. All that for
nothing. And we've only got twenty minutes till the funeral, don't
forget. Then back to the Tardis, right? <br>
DOCTOR: Funeral? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, long story. Not my own, not yet. Oh, I'm not as young
as I was. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, not as young as you were when you were me. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: When I was who? <br>
DOCTOR: You really don't recognise me? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Not at all. <br>
DOCTOR: But you're the Doctor. The next Doctor. Or the next but one. A
future Doctor anyway. No, no, don't tell me how it happened. Although,
I hope I don't just trip over a brick. That'd be embarrassing. Then
again, painless. Worse ways to go. Depends on the brick. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: You're gabbling, sir. Now might I ask, who are you,
exactly? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm, er, I'm just. Smith. John Smith. But I've heard all
about you, Doctor. Bit of a legend, if I say so myself. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Modesty forbids me to agree with you, sir. But yes. Yes, I
am. <br>
DOCTOR: A legend with certain memories missing. Am I right? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: How do you know that? <br>
DOCTOR: You've forgotten me. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Great swathes of my life have been stolen away. When I
turn my mind to the past, there's nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Going how far back? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Since the Cybermen. Masters of that hellish wall-scuttler
and old enemies of mine, now at work in London town. You won't believe
this, Mister Smith, but they are creatures from another world. <br>
DOCTOR: Really. Wow. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: It's said they fell onto London, out of the sky in a blaze
of light. And they found me. Something was taken. And something was
lost. What was I like, in the past? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think I should say. Sorry. Got to be careful with
memory loss. One wrong word <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: It's strange, though. I talk of Cybermen from the stars
and you don't blink, Mister Smith. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, don't blink. Remember that? Whatever you do, don't blink?
The blinking and the statues? Sally and the angels? No? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: You're a very odd man. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, I still am. Something's wrong here. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, the funeral! The funeral's at two o'clock. It's been a
pleasure, Mister Smith. Don't breathe a word of it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but can't I come with you? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: It's far dangerous. Rest assured, I shall keep this city
safe. Oh, and, er merry Christmas, Mister Smith. <br>
DOCTOR: Merry Christmas, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor follows at a short distance.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A Cyberman with brain visible through the front of
its helmet is in charge.) <br>
CYBERLEADER: Report. <br>
CYBERMAN: Cybershade sixteen has made contact. <br>
CYBERLEADER: Then observe the enemy. This man is dangerous. This man is
our enemy. This man is the Doctor. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR [on monitor]: I've been hunting this beast for a good
fortnight. Now step back, sir. <br>
CYBERLEADER: The attack is scheduled for fourteen hours. Plans for the
Ascension demand a successful intervention. Is everything in position? <br>
(A Victorian lady answers him.) <br>
HARTIGAN: That's rather dependent on you. All I can promise is to do my
best. <br>
CYBERLEADER: Define the parameters of best. <br>
HARTIGAN: As you would say, I will operate at maximum efficiency. And
you'll keep your part of the bargain? <br>
CYBERLEADER: You will be heralded in the new age, at the Court of the
CyberKing. <br>
ALL: The CyberKing will rise. <br>
HARTIGAN: The CyberKing will rise, indeed. How like a man. Now if
you'll excuse me, I have a funeral to attend. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Street]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It is a well attended cortege, with quite a solemn
crowd following the four black horses pulling the hearse.) <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: The late Reverend Fairchild, leaving his place of
residence for the last time. God rest his soul. Now, with the house
empty, I shall effect an entrance at the rear while you go back to the
Tardis. This is hardly work for a woman. <br>
ROSITA: Oh, don't mind me saving your life. That's work for a woman,
isn't it? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: The Doctor's companion does what The Doctor says. Off you
go. <br>
(The Doctor watches Rosita leave. The Next Doctor works on a back door,
which suddenly opens.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: How did you get in? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, front door. I'm good at doors. Er, do you mind my asking,
is that your sonic screwdriver? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Yes. I'd be lost without it. <br>
(It's an ordinary screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: But that's a screwdriver. How's it sonic? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Well, er, it makes a noise. That's sonic, isn't it? Now,
since we're acting like common burglars, I suggest we get out of plain
view. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Rev Fairchild's house]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: This investigation of yours, what's it
about? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: It started with a murder. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good. I mean bad, but whose? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Mr Jackson Lake, a teacher of mathematics from Sussex. He
came to London three weeks ago and died a terrible death. <br>
DOCTOR: Cybermen? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: It's hard to say. His body was never found. But then it
started. More secret murders, then abductions. Children, stolen away in
silence. <br>
DOCTOR: So whose house is this? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: The latest murder. The Reverend Aubrey Fairchild, found
with burns to his forehead, like some advanced form of electrocution. <br>
DOCTOR: But who was he? Was he important? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: You ask a lot of questions. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm your companion. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: The Reverend was the pillar of the community, a member of
many parish boards. A keen advocate of children's charities. <br>
DOCTOR: Children again. But why would the Cybermen want him dead? And
what's his connection to the first death, this Jackson Lake? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: It's funny. I seem to be telling you everything, as though
you engendered some sort of trust. You seem familiar, Mister Smith. I
know your face. But how? <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder. I can't help noticing you're wearing a fob watch. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Is that important? <br>
DOCTOR: Legend has it that the memories of a Time Lord can be contained
within a watch. Do you mind? <br>
(The Next Doctor hands him the watch.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's said that if it's opened <br>
(He opens it and the works fall out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Maybe not. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: It was more for decoration. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Anyway, alien infiltration. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Yes. Just look for anything different. Possibly metal.
Anything that doesn't seem to belong. Perhaps a mechanical device that
could fit no earthly engine. <br>
(The Doctor surreptitiously scans with his sonic screwdriver.) <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: It could even seem to be organic, but unlike any organism
of the natural world. Shush! What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's just me, whistling. I wonder what's in here, though. <br>
(He opens the writing desk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Different and metal, you were right. <br>
(He takes out two cylinders.) <br>
DOCTOR: They are infostamps. I mean, at a guess. If I were you, I'd say
they worked something like this. <br>
(He presses one end and images are projected from the other.) <br>
DOCTOR: See? Compressed information. Tons of it. That is the history of
London, 1066 to the present day. This is like a disc, a Cyberdisc. But
why would the Cybermen need something so simple? They've got to be
wireless. Unless, they're in the wrong century. They haven't got much
power. They need plain old basic infostamps to update themselves. Are
you all right? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: I'm fine. <br>
DOCTOR: No, what is it? What's wrong? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: I've seen one of these before. I was holding this device
the night I lost my mind. The night I regenerated. The Cybermen, they
made me change. My mind, my face, my whole self. And you were there.
Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: A friend. I swear. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Then I beg you, John. Help me. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Two words I never refuse. But it's not a conversation for a
dead man's house. It'll make more sense if we go back to the Tardis.
Your Tardis. Hold on. I just need to do a little final check. Won't
take a tick. There's one more thing I cannot figure. If this room's got
infostamps, then maybe, just maybe, it's got something that needs
infostamping. <br>
(He opens a door. There is a Cyberman behind it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. <br>
(He closes it again.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think we should run. <br>
(The Cyberman smashes the door down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor! <br>
CYBERMAN: Delete. The Doctor will be deleted. <br>
CYBERMAN 2: Delete. <br>
DOCTOR: Stairs! Can't lead them outside! <br>
(The Doctor grabs something only to discover it is an umbrella. He
takes a sword from the wall instead.) <br>
CYBERMAN: Delete. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm a dab hand with a cutlass. You don't want to come near me
when I've got one of these. This is your last warning. No? Olay, this
is really your last warning! Okay, I give up. <br>
CYBERMAN: Delete. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen to me properly. Whatever you're doing stuck in 1851, I
can help! I mean it. I'm the only person in the world who can help you!
Listen to me! <br>
CYBERMAN: Delete. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. You need me. Check your memory banks. My name's
the Doctor. Leave this man alone. The Doctor is me! <br>
(The Doctor gets a foot onto the leading Cyberman's chest and pushes
them back downstairs.) <br>
CYBERMAN: Delete. <br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor, remember? I'm the Doctor! You need me alive. You
need the Doctor, and that's me! <br>
(The Next Doctor is on the landing, studying the second infostamp. The
Cybermen knock the Doctor down.) <br>
CYBERMAN: Delete. <br>
(The Next Doctor activates the infostamp and aims the beam at the
Cybermen. They fall to their knees then their heads explode.) <br>
DOCTOR: Infostamp with a Cyclo-Steinham core. You ripped open the core
and broke the safety. Zap! Only the Doctor would think of that. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: I did that last time. <br>
DOCTOR: Come here. You'll be okay. Let me just check. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: You told them you were the Doctor. Why did you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I was just protecting you. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: You're trying to take away the only thing I've got, like
they did. They stole something, something so precious, but I can't
remember. What happened to me? What did they do? <br>
DOCTOR: We'll find out. You and me together. </font></p>

VICAR: Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to
take unto Himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we
therefore commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
and dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to
eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile

(Miss Hartigan's red dress and umbrella are putting the clergyman off.)
<br>
HARTIGAN: Do continue. <br>
VICAR: Madam, I must protest. <br>
HARTIGAN: Whatever for? <br>
VICAR: A lady at the graveside is debatable enough, but your apparel. <br>
HARTIGAN: Is it too exciting? <br>
COLE: You're disgracing the ceremony, dressed like a harlot. <br>
HARTIGAN: Oh, and you should know, Mister Cole. <br>
COLE: How do you know my name? <br>
HARTIGAN: You've walked past me so many times, all you good men of
charity, never once asking my name. <br>
SCOONES: It's Miss Hartigan, isn't it? <br>
HARTIGAN: Oh, you noticed. I saw you looking, you cheeky boy. <br>
VICAR: I'm sorry, but who is she? <br>
HARTIGAN: Matron of the St Joseph Workhouse, your humble servant. Oh,
I've watched you all. Visiting, smiling, bestowing your beneficence
upon the poor while I scrubbed down their filthy beds. <br>
VICAR: I must insist that you depart. <br>
HARTIGAN: But that's why the late Reverend Fairchild had to die. To
gather you all in one place. Where better than a funeral? Man that is
born of woman hath but a short time to live. Although I've got some
friends who might disagree with that. Would you like to meet them?
Hark! I can hear them now. <br>
(Many feet, stamping in unison on the snow, then the Cybermen appear
through the
snow shower and surround the men.) <br>
HARTIGAN: Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch, Mister Milligan,
stay where you are. You're needed. The rest of you are disposable.
Sorry. <br>
VICAR: What manner of men are they? <br>
HARTIGAN: Cybermen. <br>
(Several Cybershades are there, too.) <br>
MAN: Save yourselves! <br>
(Chaos and consternation. A Cybershade pounces on a man's back as he
flees. Others get electrocuted by the Cybermen.) <br>
HARTIGAN: I repeat. Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch, Mister
Milligan. Stay. <br>
(Bodies litter the tombstones.) <br>
COLE: You monstrous witch. <br>
HARTIGAN: Merry Christmas to you, too. <br>
SCOONES: But why are we spared? What do you need us for? <br>
HARTIGAN: Your children. It's funny, now I think of it, but in all
these years not one of you has asked my first name. It's Mercy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSITA: Doctor! I thought you were dead! <br>
(Rosita hugs her Doctor.) <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Now then, Rosita. A little decorum. <br>
ROSITA: You've been gone for so long. He's always doing this, leaving
me behind. Going frantic. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: What about the Tardis? <br>
ROSITA: Oh, she's ready. Come on. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm looking forward to this. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(No horses. The stalls have been converted into the
Next Doctor's living space.) <br>
NEXT DOCTOR; You were right though, Rosita. The Reverend Fairchild's
death was the work of the Cybermen. <br>
DOCTOR: So, you live here? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: A temporary base, until we rout the enemy. The Tardis is
magnificent, but it's hardly a home. <br>
DOCTOR: And where's the Tardis now? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: In the yard. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, what's all this luggage? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Evidence. The property of Jackson Lake, the first man to
be murdered. Oh, but my new friend is a fighter, Rosita, much like
myself. He faced the Cybermen with a cutlass. I'm not ashamed to say,
he was braver than I. He was quite brilliant. <br>
(The Doctor scans the luggage.) <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Are you whistling again? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I am, yeah. Yeah. <br>
(The Doctor mouths shush to Rosita as he puts the sonic screwdriver
back in his pocket and takes a suitcase off the pile.) <br>
ROSITA: That's another man's property. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a dead man's. <br>
(He opens the suitcase.) <br>
DOCTOR: How did you two meet, then? <br>
ROSITA: He saved my life. Late one night, by the Osterman's Wharf, this
creature came out of the shadows. A man made of metal. I thought I was
going to die. And then, there he was. The Doctor. Can you help him,
sir? He has such terrible dreams. Wakes at night in such a state of
terror. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Come now, Rosita. With all the things a Time Lord has
seen, everything he's lost, he may surely have bad dreams. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Oh, now. Look. Jackson Lake had an infostamp. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: But how? Is that significant? <br>
DOCTOR: Doctor, the answer to all this is in your Tardis. Can I see it?
<br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Mister Smith, it would be my honour. </font></p>

NEXT DOCTOR: Tardis. T A R D I S. It stands for Tethered Aerial Release
Developed In Style. Do you see? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I do now. I like it. Good Tardis. Brilliant. Nice one.
And is it inflated by gas, yeah? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: We're adjacent to the Mutton Street Gasworks. I pay them a
modest fee. Good work, Jed. <br>
(He slaps a strapping young man on the shoulder and hands him a big
five pound note. I know that because it is white.) <br>
JED: Glad to be of service, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: You've got quite a bit of money. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, you get nothing for nothing. How's that ripped panel,
Jed? <br>
JED: All repaired. Should work a treat. You never know, maybe tonight's
the night, Doctor. Imagine it, seeing Christmas from above. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: Not just yet, I think. One day, I will ascend. One day
soon. <br>
(Jed leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: You've never actually been up? <br>
ROSITA: He dreams of leaving, but never does. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: I can depart in the Tardis once London is safe. And
finally, when I'm up there. Think of it, John. The time and the space. <br>
DOCTOR: The perfect escape. Do you ever wonder what you're escaping
from? <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: With every moment. <br>
DOCTOR: Then do you want me to tell you? Because I think I've worked it
out now. How you became The Doctor. What do you think? Do you want to
know? </font></p>

waiting. First of all, let's just see. A little test. Turn right. Turn
left. And face me. Oh, I could do this forever. But now, set about your
appointed tasks, and bring them to me. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: The story begins with the Cybermen. A long
time away, and not so far from here, the Cybermen were fought, and they
were beaten. And they were sent into a howling wilderness called The
Void, locked inside forever more. But then a greater battle rose up, so
great that everything inside the Void perished. But, as the walls of
the world weakened, the last of the Cybermen must have fallen through
the dimensions, back in time, to land here. And they found you. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: I fought them, I know that. But what happened? <br>
DOCTOR: At the same time, another man came to London. Mister Jackson
Lake. Plenty of luggage, money in his pocket. Maybe coming to town for
the winter season, I don't know. But he found the Cybermen too. And
just like you, exactly like you, he took hold of an infostamp. <br>
NEXT DOCTOR: But he's dead. Jackson Lake is dead. The Cybermen murdered
him. <br>
DOCTOR: You said no body was ever found. And you kept all his
suitcases, but you could never bring yourself to open them. I told you
the answer was in the fob watch. Can I see? <br>
(The Next Doctor hands the watch to the Doctor. The case is plain
except for two initials.) <br>
DOCTOR: J L. The watch is Jackson Lake's. <br>
ROSITA: Jackson Lake is you, sir? <br>
LAKE: But I'm the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: You became the Doctor because the infostamp you picked up was a

Void, I'd say, but it's everything you could want to know about the
Doctor. <br>
(The images get to number ten.) <br>
LAKE: That's you. <br>
DOCTOR: Time Lord, Tardis, enemy of the Cybermen. The one and the only.
You see, the infostamp must have backfired. Streamed all that
information about me right inside your head. <br>
LAKE: I am nothing but a lie. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. Infostamps are just facts and figures. All
that bravery. Saving Rosita, defending London town, hmm? And the
invention. Building a Tardis. That's all you. <br>
LAKE: And what else? Tell me what else. <br>
DOCTOR: There's still something missing, isn't there? <br>
LAKE: I demand you tell me, sir. Tell me what they took. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. Really, I am so sorry, but that's an awful lot of
luggage for one man. Because an infostamp is plain technology. It's not
enough to make a man lose his mind. What you suffered is called a
fugue. A fugue state, where the mind just runs away because it can't
bear to look back. You wanted to become someone else, because Jackson
Lake had lost so much. <br>

more of them in a trunk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you found a whole cache of infostamps. <br>
ROSITA: But what is it? What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: Activation. A call to arms. The Cybermen are moving! <br>

be someone at his side. Now go. Go. <br>

change my mind. The Cybermen offered me the one thing I wanted.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Dimension vault thing beeps.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, now you're ready. <br>
(He aims it at the CyberKing. Swirls of energy surround it and it
vanishes.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Street]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAKE: Well, I'd say he used that Dimension vault to
transfer the wreckage of the CyberKing into the Time Vortex, t
here to be harmlessly disintegrated. Oh, I've picked up a lot. Ah, but
here. Ladies and gentlemen, I know that man, that Doctor on high. And I
know that he has done this deed a thousand times. But not once. No,
sir, not once, not ever, has he ever been thanked. But no more. For I
say to you, on this Christmas morn, bravo, sir! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo,
sir! <br>
(Up in the sky, the Doctor hears the cheers and applause, and waves
back, ringing the basket's bell.) <br>
LAKE: Bravo, Doctor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Market place]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAKE: The city will recover, as London always does.
Though the events of today will be history, spoken of for centuries to
come. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Funny that. <br>
LAKE: And a new history begins for me. I find myself a widower, but
with my son and with a good friend. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, take care of that one. She's marvellous. <br>
LAKE: Frederick will need a nursemaid and I can think of none better.
But you're welcome to join us. We thought we might all dine together at
the Traveller's Halt. A Christmas feast in celebration, and in memory
of those we have lost. You won't stay? <br>
DOCTOR: Like I said, you know me. <br>
LAKE: No I don't think anyone does. <br>
(He sees the real Tardis underneath the archway.) <br>
LAKE: Oh! And this is it. Oh! Oh, if I might, Doctor. One last
adventure? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, be my guest. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAKE: Oh. Oh my word. Oh. Oh, goodness me. Well.
But this is, but this is nonsense. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's one word for it. <br>
LAKE: Complete and utter, wonderful nonsense. How very, very silly. Oh,
no. I can't bear it. Oh, it's causing my head to ache. No. No, no, no,
no, no, no </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Market place]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAKE: Oh! Oh, gracious. That's quite enough. I take
it this is goodbye. <br>
DOCTOR: Onwards and upwards. <br>
LAKE: Tell me one thing. All those facts and figures I saw of the
Doctor's life, you were never alone. All those bright and shining
companions. But not any more? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
LAKE: Might I ask why not? <br>
DOCTOR: They leave. Because they should. Or they find someone else. And
some of them, some of them forget me. I suppose in the end, they break
my heart. <br>
LAKE: That offer of Christmas dinner. It's no longer a request, it's a
demand. In memory of those we've lost. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, go on then. <br>
LAKE: Really? <br>
DOCTOR: Just this once. You've actually gone and changed my mind. Not
many people can do that. Jackson, if anyone had to be the Doctor, I'm
glad it was you. <br>
LAKE: The feast awaits. Come with me. Walk this way. <br>
DOCTOR: I certainly will. Merry Christmas to you, Jackson. <br>
LAKE: Merry Christmas indeed, Doctor. </font> </p>
