and we zoom in on then tour a massive space station. A circular hatch
opens and a beam of light lances out into the void, ensnaring the
Tardis and dragging it in. The Tardis materialises by a staircase and
the Doctor stumbles out. He shakes his head to clear it, then goes up
the steps and nearly knocks on the doors at the top. Changing his mind,
he pushes them open and walks into -) </font></p>

say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419785/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Michael
Jayston</a>.) <br>
VALEYARD: At last, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I late for something? <br>
VALEYARD: I was beginning to fear you had lost yourself. Sit down. <br>
(The Doctor moves to where the Valeyard indicates, to discover a chair.
The Valeyard then turns on the lights and we see that the chair is in a
dock.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, even I would find it hard to lose myself in a corridor.
Especially, when propelled by the mental energy of so many
distinguished Time Lords. <br>
(The Doctor waves at a group of shadowy figures in the formal Time Lord
costume sitting in two raised rows of pews by the wall to his left.) <br>
VALEYARD: Oh, I don't know. You seem to have a great talent for
straying from the straight and narrow. <br>
(Citadel guards enter and the lights come up to full as a woman in
white robe with a red scarf is escorted to a separate chair and table
below the rows of Time Lords. Everyone wave Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0069019/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Lynda Bellingham</a>.) <br>
DOCTOR: Would it be too much to ask what all this is about? <br>
INQUISITOR: The accused will remain silent until invited to speak. <br>
DOCTOR: The accused? Do you mean me? <br>
INQUISITOR: I call upon the Valeyard to open the case. <br>
VALEYARD: By order of the High Council, this is an impartial enquiry
into the behaviour of the accused person, known as the Doctor, who is
charged that he, on diverse occasions has been guilty of conduct
unbecoming a Time Lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Not guilty! <br>
VALEYARD: He is also charged with, on diverse occasions, transgressing
the First Law. It is my unpleasant task, Madam Inquisitor, to prove to
the enquiry that the Doctor is an incorrigible meddler in the affairs
of other peoples and planets. <br>
INQUISITOR: Yes. I see, Valeyard, that it is on record that the Doctor
has faced trial already for offences of this nature. <br>
VALEYARD: That is so, my lady, and I shall contend that the High
Council showed too great a leniency on that occasion. <br>
INQUISITOR: Very well. Doctor, you've heard the charges. Do you wish to
say anything before the enquiry proceeds? <br>
DOCTOR: Only that this whole thing is a farce. I am Lord President of
Gallifrey. You can't put me on trial. <br>
INQUISITOR: Doctor, since you willfully neglected the responsibility of
your great office, you were deposed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Is that legal? <br>
INQUISITOR: Perfectly. But we won't hold it against you. Quite the
contrary in fact. And to see that your interests are fully protected, I
propose to appoint a court defender to represent you. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, oh, er, thank you, but no thank you. I have been through
several such inquiries before. I think it would be easier if I speak
for myself. <br>
INQUISITOR: The court notes the Doctor refuses the services of a court
defender. Proceed, Valeyard. <br>
VALEYARD: Inquisitor, I am not proposing to waste the time of the court
by dwelling in detail on the activities of the accused. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
VALEYARD: Instead, I intend to adumbrate two typical instances from
separate epistopic interfaces of the spectrum. These examples of the
criminal behaviour of the accused are fully recorded in the Matrix, the
repository of all knowledge. <br>
<i> DOCTOR: Objection. <br>
INQUISITOR: I hear the accused. What is this objection? <br>
DOCTOR: The Matrix does not contain all knowledge. It merely contains
all Time Lord knowledge. <br>
INQUISITOR: It has long been accepted that the Matrix is the repository
of all knowledge. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that only shows the insular complacency of this society.
How do you know that there isn't knowledge that you don't possess? <br>
INQUISITOR: All that is known is within the Matrix. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, a micro-organism in a drop of water might think it knows
the universe. All it knows is that drop of water. <br>
VALEYARD: I think this is merely a semantic point, my lady. <br>
INQUISITOR: I agree. I find the objection of the accused to be not
valid. Please continue. <br>
VALEYARD: Thank you, my lady. </i> (Everyone in the court turns
to a screen high on the wall above the ranks of Time Lords.) <br>
VALEYARD: I should like to begin with the Doctor's involvement in the
affairs of Ravalox, a planet within the Stellian galaxy.

DOCTOR: Oh, stop whinging. <br>

to the admission of the accused that he obtained access to confidential
material from Gallifrey. A file privy only to members of the High
Council. <br>
INQUISITOR: That is noted. Doctor, why did you go to Ravalox? <br>
DOCTOR: Simple scientific curiosity. I'm not so egotistic as to believe
all knowledge is at my fingertips. <br>
INQUISITOR: Your crude sarcasm is also noted. I should warn you,
Doctor, that your hostile attitude is not helpful. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not here to help. And while you're making all those notes,
do please note that I did not have access to confidential material. The
fireball that destroyed Ravalox is documented in Extinct Civilisations
by Warris Bossard. <br>
ORDERLY: This is true, my lady. <br>
INQUISITOR: I see. I find the point that the Doctor gained access to
confidential material to be not proven, unless you have further
evidence, Valeyard. <br>
VALEYARD: It is not of great importance, my lady. <br>
INQUISITOR: Continue. <br>
VALEYARD: Most certainly.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor and Peri are strolling in an autumnal
forest, under a large and garish golf
umbrella. We're back at the Queen Elizabeth Country Park, Horndean.) <br>
PERI: I don't think I like Ravalox very much. It reminds me of a wet
November back on Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's part of the reason why we're here. <br>
PERI: Huh? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Ravalox has the same mass, angle of tilt and period of
rotation as Earth. <br>
PERI: So? <br>
DOCTOR: Well I thought that was quite interesting. It's unusual to find
two planets so similar. In fact, it's quite a phenomenon. <br>
PERI: Oh, pity it couldn't be a dry one. <br>
DOCTOR: Ravalox also has the distinction of having been destroyed by a
solar fireball. <br>
PERI: It doesn't look very destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: According to the records on Gallifrey, it was devastated by a
solar fireball some five centuries ago. I think somebody exaggerated,
don't you? <br>
PERI: Hmm. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
(A little further on, the drizzle has stopped so the Doctor puts the
umbrella down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, the exhilarating smell of a freshly laundered forest. Can't
beat it. <br>
PERI: And the twittering of tiny birds and the rustling of small
mammals as they forage for food in the undergrowth. <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
PERI: Then you've better hearing than me. There aren't any birds.
Listen. <br>
DOCTOR: I wondered when you'd notice. <br>
PERI: None of this makes any sense. Any soil left after the visitation
of a fireball would be sterile. <br>
DOCTOR: Well done. <br>
PERI: Don't patronise me Doctor. You knew from the start this amount of
growth wasn't possible. <br>
DOCTOR: I also knew, that as a student of botany, you'd soon realise
the truth without any prompting from me. <br>
PERI: Maybe. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
PERI: Is there any intelligent life here? <br>
DOCTOR: Apart from me, you mean? I don't know. Shall we find out? <br>
(As the Doctor and Peri move off down a path, they are watched by a
pair of
men. The younger one speaks to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0783007/" target="_blank"><font color="#000000">Tony
Selby</font></a>.) <br>
DIBBER: Well, they're not from round here, Mister Glitz. <br>
GLITZ: I know that, Dibber. <br>
(The Doctor spots something by the path.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Look at this. <br>
(It is a necklace. He hooks it up with the umbrella.) <br>
DOCTOR: We are certainly not on this planet alone. Mmm hmm. Let's
reconnoiter, shall we? <br>
(The two men prepare their weapons. Glitz screws a silencer onto his
gun.) <br>
GLITZ: You know, Dibber, I'm the product of a broken home. <br>
DIBBER: You have mentioned it on occasions, Mister Glitz. <br>
GLITZ: Which sort of unbalanced me. Made me selfish to the point where
I cannot stand competition. <br>
DIBBER: Know the feeling only too well, Mister Glitz. <br>
GLITZ: Where as yours is a simple case of sociopathy, Dibber, my
malaise is much more complex. A deep-rooted maladjustment, my
psychiatrist said. Brought on by an infantile inability to come to
terms with the more pertinent, concrete aspects of life. <br>
DIBBER: That sounds more like an insult than a diagnosis, Mister Glitz.
<br>
GLITZ: You're right there, my lad. Mind you, I had just attempted to
kill him. Oh, I do hate prison psychiatrists, don't you? I mean, they
do nothing for you. I must have seen dozens of them, and I still hate
competition. Especially when it poaches my territory. I'm going to
enjoy this. <br>
(Glitz has the Doctor in the cross-hairs of his viewfinder, then the
Doctor drops out of sight.) <br>
GLITZ: Too late! Oh, I do hate it when people get lucky. It really
offends my sensibilities. <br>
DIBBER: Shouldn't we go after them? <br>
GLITZ: How is it they know where to look? Tell me that, Dibber. <br>
DIBBER: I don't know. Maybe they've all copied the same map we did. Do
you want me to go after them? <br>
GLITZ: Why? Do you want to help them? <br>
DIBBER: No, it's just that if we're after the same thing as us <br>
GLITZ: Don't worry. They'll soon be dead. It's just that I wanted the
personal pleasure of killing them myself. <br>
(The Doctor and Peri have gone down a slope.) <br>
PERI: Oh, here, Doctor, look. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
(Peri has found a stone carving or plaque in the slope they've just
come down.) <br>
DOCTOR: The remains of a building. <br>
PERI: And we're not going inside. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course not, we can't. We haven't found the entrance yet.
This is the type of place where some early life forms might have
survived. Come along. <br>
PERI: I'm just not crazy about meeting any early life forms. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yeah. <br>
(Dibber and Glitz put their weapons away.) <br>
DIBBER: Well, if we've got competition, going to the village could be a
valuable waste of time. <br>
GLITZ: That complex down there is still functional, which means the L3
robot is operational. <br>
DIBBER: I understand. <br>
GLITZ: To render the robot non-operational, we have to destroy the
light converter which supplies its energy system. <br>
DIBBER: I know all that. <br>
GLITZ: Then why are you arguing with me? It's not my fault if a bunch
of backward savages have turned a Magnum Mark Seven light converter
into a totem pole. <br>
DIBBER: It's just that I think we should kill those two first. <br>
GLITZ: And meet the robot head on at full power? I don't think you have
my full interests at heart, Dibber. <br>
DIBBER: If the robot doesn't kill them before we destroy his energy
supply, well, they could be up and away with the goods before we've
even got back from the village. <br>
GLITZ: I know that, Dibber. Now you understand why I hate competition.
It spoils everything. <br>
DIBBER: I still think we should kill them. <br>
GLITZ: We will, Dibber, we will. When the time is right. <br>
(Down at the structure, the Doctor is studying the remains.) <br>
PERI: Doctor, I know this sounds crazy, but I have the weirdest feeling
that I've been here before. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I often get that feeling. Of course, I usually have. In
your case, it's not possible. <br>
PERI: Well, possible or not, I want to get away from here. <br>
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right. We must find out what's going on here.
<br>
<i> PERI: This place is spooky. It's like an overgrown
fallout shelter. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. You're partly right. This must have been their last
desperate attempt to escape the coming fireball. <br>
PERI: Well, who lived on this planet? <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's something of a mystery. There's strangely little
about Ravalox in the records of Gallifrey. Obviously they were a fairly
advanced species. Look. <br>
(The Doctor pulls aside vegetation to reveal the plaque. Then he finds
a tunnel entrance.) <br>
</i> DOCTOR: Ah ha! That's it. <i>You know, you can
deduce an awful lot about a civilisation from its art. <br>
PERI: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I might stay here a couple of years and write a
thesis about that. </i>Come along. <br>

a line of people walk along in the distance.) <br>

DIBBER: Are they from the village? <br>
GLITZ: Must be. <br>
DIBBER: Well then, let's make it a few less we'll have to deal with. <br>
GLITZ: No. All we need is a gesture of strength. Show them they haven't
got a chance. <br>

GLITZ: Amazing the affect a loud bang can have on the primitive mind. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, I suppose there is a billion to one chance there was a
place called Marble Arch on Ravalox. <br>
PERI: And they wrote in English? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's another billion to one chance. It does begin to
seem a little unlikely, doesn't it? <br>
PERI: Oh, Doctor, we're on Earth aren't we? I said it felt like Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: It's in the wrong part of space for it to be your planet.
Besides, according to all the record books, this is Ravalox. <br>
PERI: Well then, how do you explain this? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, they. I can't. Not yet. Unless of course, perhaps they
collected railway stations. <br>
PERI: That's ridiculous. <br>
DOCTOR: But not impossible, though. Not as impossible as the other
explanation. <br>
PERI: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that somehow or other your planet and its entire
constellation managed to shift itself a couple of light years across
space, after which, for some reason, it became known as Ravalox. <br>
PERI: Well, what time are we in? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, a long time after your period. <br>

And all you do is talk about it as though we're in a planetarium. <br>

perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, reforms into other patterns, other

punished us by sending the great fire which destroyed our planet. <br>

have three. <br>

BALAZAR: The Books of Knowledge. <br>

written on the front. <br>

tells of a great white water god, and contains many mystical passages. <br>

What else do you read? <br>
BALAZAR: The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley, which tells of life long

have no function. <br>

DRATHRO: Is that abuse? <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. <br>
DRATHRO: I am listening. <br>
DOCTOR: You are only a robot. The people out there, the work units, the
organics, whatever you choose to call them, they're living creatures,
Drathro. They have a right to their lives. <br>
DRATHRO: Explain why. <br>
DOCTOR: In your terms, I can't. Whoever programmed you forgot to
include moral values. <br>
DRATHRO: I know of values. Is your point that organics are of more
value than robots? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, if you want to look at it that way. <br>
DRATHRO: Then why should I be in command of organics if they are of
greater value? <br>
DOCTOR: Without organics there wouldn't be any robots. There'd be no
one to create them. <br>
DRATHRO: Accepted. This shows that robots are more advanced, therefore
of more value.

DOCTOR: Understanding is not the same as knowing, Drathro. Your work
units are the result of millions of years of development. Life,
Drathro. <br>

was about, you'd want me to save those people out there. <br>
DRATHRO: Why? I have said that without me they have no purpose. <br>
DOCTOR: Everything in life has its purpose, Drathro. Every creature
plays its part. But the purpose of life is too big to be knowable. A
million computers couldn't solve that one. <br>
