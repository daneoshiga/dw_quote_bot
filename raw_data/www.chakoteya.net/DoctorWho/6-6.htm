<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Far out in space hangs a segmented structure built
solely to receive and transmit data across the space ways. A black
dart-shaped craft approaches it and docks. Three men carry boxes of
equipment into the beacon. Outside the beacon, two space-walkers attach
magnetic charges its hull and finally a rocket propulsion unit.) <br>
CAVEN: Dervish! Dervish! <br>
DERVISH: (a thin man) We've nearly finished. <br>
CAVEN: About time. <br>
DERVISH: My men are just coming. We'll detonate by radio beam. <br>
CAVEN: Right. Hurry it up. <br>
(All the men return to the ship. It undocks and moves away. Shortly
afterwards a radio signal is sent and beacon Alpha One goes KaBOOM!)

is thin and wide, with military insignia V41-LO. The flight deck is
split into an upper command bridge with silver-haired General Hermack
in charge, and a lower technical area.) <br>
HERMACK: Everything all right, Penn? <br>
(played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0561975/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Jack

Layton</a> with a zapata moustache.) <br>
HERMACK: Fine. <br>
WARNE: (American) You sent for me, sir? <br>
HERMACK: Ah yes, Ian. Sit down. <br>
WARNE: Thank you. <br>
HERMACK: Any information on that beacon signal yet? <br>
WARNE: No, sir. There's been no response to the secondary emergency
circuits. either. <br>
HERMACK: No, there wouldn't be. <br>
WARNE: Sir? <br>
HERMACK: What do you think has happened to that beacon? <br>
WARNE: Well, it's difficult to say, sir. It could be a failure in the
solar energy store. <br>
HERMACK: No. The emergency power would operate and we'd get a may day
signal. <br>
WARNE: Well. Oh, you don't think this is a mechanical failure, sir? <br>
HERMACK: No. No, I don't. These beacons are practically fool proof. <br>
WARNE: You got any ideas? <br>
HERMACK: Yes, I have. And I must be right. Argonite! These beacons are
almost entirely constructed of argonite. <br>
WARNE: Of course, sir. What are you going to do about it? <br>
HERMACK: Attention all personnel. This is General Hermack. Your V-ship
is now fifty days and many billions of miles out from Earth. You're
entering the fourth sector of our galaxy. In this sector for some time
now, Earth Government has been aware that a highly organised gang of
criminals have been roaming the space ways, and preying upon
defenceless cargo ships. The main target of these criminals is
argonite, the most valuable mineral known to man and so far only found
on the planets of the Fourth Sector. A government space beacon marking
the approaches to the planet New Sarum has ceased transmitting its
navigation signal. These beacons, as you know, are constructed of
argonite. It is my belief that the criminals are attacking the
government navigation beacons and plundering the argonite. There can be
no other explanation for its failure. This being the case, I have
decided to abandon our present mission and to investigate the missing
beacon in the New Sarum sector. I want all section commanders on the
bridge at twenty hundred hours sector four solar time. Resume normal
duties until then. <br>
WARNE: There are eighteen space beacons quite scattered across this
sector, sir. <br>
HERMACK: Seventeen, Ian, until the one at New Sarum's replaced. <br>
WARNE: Seventeen. And they're millions of miles apart. So how can we be
sure which one the pirates are likely to attack next? <br>
HERMACK: We can't. <br>
WARNE: Well, exactly. The odds are seventeen to one against us being in
the right place at the right time. <br>
HERMACK: Ah! With our speed, I think we can cut those odds a bit. Now,
there are four beacons in the Pliny solar system here. That is where
we'll start our patrol.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Beacon Alpha Seven]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There is a dart-shaped craft docked to this beacon
now. It is the same routine as at Alpha One.) <br>
CAVEN: Come on! Speed it up. <br>
DERVISH: Caven, I don't like this. <br>
CAVEN: Nobody's asking you to like it. Just get those scissor charges
laid into position. <br>
DERVISH: If we attack any more beacons, we'll have the whole of the
Interstellar Space Corps in this sector. <br>
CAVEN: Look, as of this moment, the Space Corps has its hands full of
trouble. Bush fire wars in three different sectors. There's never been
a better time for getting rich. <br>
DERVISH: Right, lads. Now, we'll lay four charges along the main axis,
then we'll attach booster charges around the hull. Okay. <br>
CAVEN: You're a good engineer, Dervish. Just do your job and leave the
Space Corps to me, eh? <br>
DERVISH: Okay. But I worked ten years for Earth Government. <br>
CAVEN: You should've stayed with them. They'd have given you a pension.
<br>
DERVISH: Attacking Government property is one crime they make sure
never pays. <br>
CAVEN: Sixteen hundred tons of pure argonite pays all right, Dervish.
To me this is like a floating bank. <br>
(The charges are laid.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[V-Ship flight deck]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WARNE: What range are the forward scanners set for,
Penn? <br>
PENN: Fifteen hundred, sir. <br>
WARNE: Well reset them at two thousand. Right? <br>
PENN: Very good, sir. <br>
WARNE: And keep a sharp eye on that screen. There are lots of rogue
asteroids in the Pliny system. <br>
HERMACK: Oh, and one thing more. Make sure the Minnow ships are fully
fuelled, and put the detonation heads on their missiles. Report back as
soon as that is done. <br>
WARNE: We're approaching the Pliny system now, sir. We've made scanner
contact with the four beacons. They're functioning normally. <br>
HERMACK: Ah good. Now this planet Ta, here, is the main one in the
system. We'll orbit here for a few weeks and see what happens. <br>
WARNE: So that's Ta, huh? <br>
HERMACK: You've heard of it? <br>
WARNE: Yeah. It's the head quarters of the Issigri Mining Corporation.
The most productive planet in the entire galaxy. <br>
HERMACK: Madeleine Issigri has built quite a place there. Which is one
reason for basing ourselves in the Pliny system. <br>
WARNE: Why's that a reason, sir? <br>
HERMACK: Well, if we're out here long, Ian, the men will need somewhere
for rest and recreation. Deep space sickness is the one thing we can't
chance. <br>
PENN: Major Warne. <br>
WARNE: What is it, Penn? <br>
PENN: I've got a contact, sir, at beacon Alpha Seven. <br>
WARNE: Well, hold on it. Any identification? <br>
PENN: No, sir. Too far away. <br>
HERMACK: Ah, it's a space ship right enough. Check Central Flight
Information, Ian, and see if anyone should be out there. <br>
WARNE: Right, sir. <br>
HERMACK: Change course for beacon Alpha Seven. Bridge to Power Room, I
want ten seconds main boost. <br>
WARNE: According to Flight Information, sir, there should be no ships
in the area within the next seventeen days. <br>
HERMACK: Well, whoever they are, they've not yet reported to Central
Flight Information. <br>
WARNE: Do you think it's the pirates? <br>
HERMACK: Yes, it could be. Though some of these commercial flights
don't always like to report their whereabouts, for reasons of their
own. Anyway, we shall soon know.
(Meanwhile, the pirate ship undocks from Alpha Seven.) <br>
PENN: She's backing off, sir. <br>
HERMACK: Keep track of her. <br>
PENN: She's moving quite fast, sir. <br>
WARNE: Got a good turn of speed for a commercial. <br>
HERMACK: Is beacon Alpha Seven still functioning? <br>
WARNE: Yes, sir. Very strong signal. <br>
HERMACK: Well, that's something. <br>
WARNE: Maybe they were just picking up emergency supplies, sir. Some of
these beacons do carry reserve medical and oxygen equipment. <br>
PENN: Sir, I've got another signal coming in now. It's a UHF! <br>
WARNE: UHF? But that's reserved for demolition teams. <br>
HERMACK: Well, put it on audio. <br>
PENN: Yes, sir. <br>
(Beacon Alpha Seven explodes.) <br>
PENN: Alpha Seven's broken up, sir. <br>
HERMACK: Ah. Right under our noses. Main boost. <br>
PENN: Lost the beacon, sir. No more signal. <br>
WARNE: No, there won't be. It's probably in a dozen separate bits by
now. <br>
HERMACK: Keep full contact with that pirate ship. <br>
PENN: Yes, sir. <br>
HERMACK: At least we can be sure they don't get away. Ian, give me a
projected arrival time. <br>
WARNE: Three hours, sir. Maybe I can get a visual on the main scanner. <br>
(The pirate ship appears on the viewscreen, towing beacon debris.) <br>
WARNE: There she is sir. And that's what's left of the beacon. <br>
HERMACK: We've got them cold, Ian. We'll be onto them long before they
get rid of that salvaged scrap. <br>
WARNE: Yeah, providing she doesn't see us approaching, sir. <br>
HERMACK: They don't know <br>
PENN: That ship looks fast <br>
HERMACK: They don't know we're in the same area. What's wrong with the
scanner? <br>
WARNE: Seem to be losing visual contact, sir. <br>
PENN: The ship's moving away, sir. <br>
HERMACK: What? <br>
PENN: Just started to go, and the beacon debris's going with her. <br>
HERMACK: Hold that contact, Penn. <br>
PENN: It's no good, sir. She's going too fast. <br>
HERMACK: They must have twice our speed!&nbsp;<br>
WARNE: Maybe the Minnows could hold her? <br>
HERMACK: Not at this distance. They haven't the fuel. <br>
PENN: Lost contact, sir. <br>
HERMACK: Oh, hold the same course. <br>
PENN: Sir. <br>
HERMACK: Keep searching. <br>
WARNE: They must have attached rocket units to the beacon, sir, the way
it moved off. <br>
HERMACK: Yes. They're very well organised. They cut the beacon into
several manageable pieces by means of scissor charges, then shoot the
bits off to some pre-arranged collection point. Very clever. <br>
WARNE: And quick. It cuts down the time they're at risk. And they just
burn out the Argonite at their leisure. <br>
HERMACK: Ian, we shall have to rethink our tactics. We shall never
catch them by normal patrol methods. <br>
WARNE: What else can we do, sir? <br>
HERMACK: Man the beacons. <br>
WARNE: Man them? <br>
HERMACK: It's the only answer. We'll drop small parties of four or five
men on each beacon and give them rations and supplies for two months.
Well, all these mark five beacons were designed as emergency survival
centres. <br>
WARNE: Yes sir, but I don't think anybody has ever tried living on
them. Some of these beacons are pretty primitive. <br>
HERMACK: I'm not interested in men's comfort, Major. Set course for the
nearest beacon. <br>
WARNE: Yes, sir.

WARNE: Here's your radio, Lieutenant. It's beamed automatically to main
control. All you have to do in the event of trouble is press this
button, right? <br>
SORBA: (Dark) Don't worry, I'll press it. <br>
WARNE: Remember your main job here is to give us the earliest possible
warning in the event of the pirate ship approaching, right? <br>
SORBA: And after that, we fight them. <br>
WARNE: After that, I think you'll have to, Joe. Good Luck. <br>
SORBA: Thank you. <br>

PENN: Very good, sir. <br>
WARNE: I told Lieutenant Sorba we'd be back in about six weeks. sir. <br>
HERMACK: Or much earlier if the pirates raid Alpha Four. How's morale
on the picket? <br>
WARNE: Oh, it's pretty high, sir. I think they're hoping for the chance
of a party. <br>
HERMACK: They understand they have to shoot on sight? <br>
WARNE: Yes, sir, I told them. No, anybody poking their nose aboard
Alpha Four will find plenty of trouble waiting for him.

DOCTOR: Yes. I've never seen a computer quite like this before, Jamie. <br>
ZOE: It looks like some sort of control room. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but what does it control? <br>
JAMIE: Yeah. Well I think we'd better get out of here before somebody
catches us. <br>
ZOE: Good idea. There's a door here. <br>
JAMIE: No, Zoe. I meant in the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, stop worrying. There's obviously nobody here. <br>
JAMIE: Well, how do you know that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this machine is programmed to operate by itself. <br>
ZOE: Yes, but what does it do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure Zoe, but I think we're on an unmanned
spacecraft in a fixed orbit. We're too far away from anywhere to be a
weather satellite. Let's see what clues we can find through here, shall
we? <br>

WARNE: General? <br>
HERMACK: Isn't that what you were going to say? <br>
WARNE: Something like that, yeah. <br>
HERMACK: You see? They're moving out of range already. <br>
WARNE: If only we could have sustained continual main boost, it might
have been a different story. They must have a base somewhere in this
system. We're more than fifty days out from home planet. <br>
HERMACK: Quite. They can have main boost the whole time. Our only
chance is getting close enough to launch the Minnows. <br>
WARNE: Or locate their base. They must have dispatched pieces of that
beacon to it. If we could just locate one of the pieces. <br>
HERMACK: Can't be done. If those auxiliary rockets cut out, we've
nowhere to track on. You see? There's nothing left now. <br>
WARNE: We've got the tactile scanner, sir. <br>
HERMACK: That would be like looking for a single speck of dust at the
bottom of an argonite mine. <br>
WARNE: Do you think there's any chance they're still alive out there? <br>
HERMACK: You mean Sorba's men? <br>

Alpha Four went up. <br>
WARNE: Right, can I get it on the TS? <br>
PENN: We should be able to, sir. Bearing starboard nineteen from SDC. <br>
WARNE: Nineteen SDC. <br>
HERMACK: What is it, Ian? <br>
WARNE: Something on the radar, sir. <br>
HERMACK: The pirates? <br>
WARNE: Well, if it is, there's something wrong with their ship. She's
hardly moving. <br>
HERMACK: But they don't even know we're in the same area. <br>
WARNE: Oh I don't know, sir. They must be aware that there's a V-ship
in the system. They ran into our picket on Alpha Four. Which is why.
somehow, I don't think this could be their ship. <br>
HERMACK: But according to flight information, there should be nothing
in this solar system for the next eighty hours. <br>
(Warne gets an image on a rear monitor.) <br>
WARNE: There she is, sir. And that isn't the ship we saw before. <br>

themselves, roaming the spaceways, looking for planets, jumping each
other's claims. They were a wild breed, Ian, and they learned to live

HERMACK: Get to the point, Clancey. <br>
MILO: You would know the point if you'd been reading my reports I've
been sending to you the last two years. <br>
WARNE: What do you mean? <br>
MILO: Argonite pirates, that's what I mean, sonny. <br>
HERMACK: Go on, Clancey. <br>
MILO: Over the last two years, I have lost five floaters carrying
argonite ore back to home planet. They were hijacked, General, and they
were brought into this system. <br>
WARNE: You reported this, you say? <br>
MILO: Ah, aye, I reported this, sonny. About a dozen times I reported
it but it didn't do me any good, did it. So I said to myself, all
right, all righty, I'll just have to do something about this myself. <br>
HERMACK: How much argonite did you have on each floater? <br>
MILO: I had a full load. Fifty thousand tons unrefined ore. <br>
WARNE: What makes you so sure your floaters were bought into this
system? <br>
MILO: Time, sonny, time. This system is the closest to where they left
the spaceway. And my old floaters, they've got no propulsion units.
They're unmanned. They don't move very fast, sonny. <br>
WARNE: I know that! <br>
MILO: Oh, he's a good lad. He's a bright lad, this boy of yours. Good
thinking. Is it all right if I blow my nose, or is that another
offence? My old nose. I can't get used to all your fancy
air-conditioning. <br>
HERMACK: That's a pity, Clancey, but I'm afraid you'll have to put up
with it a bit longer. Now, how long have you been in the area of beacon
Alpha Four? <br>
MILO: Beacon Alpha Four? <br>
HERMACK: Yes. <br>
MILO: Oh. Have you a chart, General? <br>
HERMACK: Here. <br>
MILO: Oh, that's where we are. Well, well, well. You see, my charts
don't pick up these new fanged beacons. I don't trust them. <br>
WARNE: Just an astral pointer and a piece of string, huh? <br>
MILO: That is right, sonny. Hey listen, I can't see beacon Alpha Four
here either. That's what I'm telling you. They're unreliable. They're a
waste of public money. <br>
HERMACK: Beacon Alpha Four is not registering because it's not there
any more. <br>
WARNE: The argonite pirates blew it up three hours ago. <br>
MILO: Oh, did they so. That'd be for salvage I guess. Yeah, that would
be it. <br>
HERMACK: You don't seem very surprised, Clancey. <br>
MILO: No, no, I'm not, General. This is clearing up a whole heap of
things in my head. I can lose every floater I've got and your fancy
Space Corps won't do a thing about it. But the government loses one
government beacon and that's a different matter. Then you come running.
That's what you're here now for <br>
HERMACK: Well, if there is any truth in your story, Clancey, and we do
catch up with the pirates, you'll be entitled to put in a claim for
compensation. <br>
MILO: If I waited for you to catch these critters, I'd catch my death
of cold waiting forever. I should think this old crate of yours has
about half the speed of a Beta Dart, right? <br>
WARNE: Our speed is classified information. <br>
MILO: Oh, that may be, sonny, but this marauding band of sharks, you
know they're using Beta Darts, one of the latest. You're in the wrong
league, boys. Why don't you just go home where you came from. <br>
WARNE: How do you know what ship they have? <br>

ZOE: They didn't teach me anything about argonite. <br>
MILO: Oh! <br>
ZOE: Have you ever heard of argonite, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, from what Mister Clancey was saying, I imagine it's a
metal that's used in the construction of spacecraft. Am I right?
MILO: Argonite is used for, well, it's used for practically everything.
It's ductile, it's tensile, it's heat-proof, it's practically
indestructible. <br>
DOCTOR: Magnetically polarised for copper. <br>
MILO: Ah. You mean to say that you have honestly never heard of
argonite? It's the most expensive mineral in the galaxy. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you already. We don't come from this civilisation. We
are visitors. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, and I hope we're not stopping long. <br>
MILO: Well, if that doesn't beat jumping grasshoppers. You mean to say
you travel around in time as well as space? <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Oh, my word. Do you know where they are? <br>

them off for salvage. <br>

questions about them, I do something useful. Why don't you do something
useful. Why don't you make us all a pot of tea or something? <br>

WARNE [on monitor]: No, sir. I talked to some of the mining crew. They
said he took off several weeks ago. They haven't heard from him since. <br>
HERMACK: Are you sure they're speaking the truth? <br>
WARNE [on monitor]: I'm sure they are, sir. I made a pretty close

somewhere in the computer preselector. Now do you know where that is? <br>
