</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Thunder and lightning still crash around the
Citadel of Peladon, carved halfway up a mountainside. Deep in the
bowels of the mountain, a group of four workers are wheeling a
contraption along a tunnel. It is wooden, has a large pneumatic tyre on
the front wheel and a silvery dish with an antenna pointing forward.) <br>
ETTIS: Come on, lads. Come on, keep it moving. Mustn't keep our lords
and masters waiting. Straight through the gallery. <br>
(A peculiar noise fills the air.) <br>
ETTIS: What's that? Aggedor. It is the spirit of Aggedor! <br>
(Two of his companions run off. The third falls backward against some
rocks and is enveloped in a red glow. He screams, then vanishes. The
sound stops, and Ettis runs off. Elsewhere, a large crystal is being
examined by a human using an eye glass.) <br>
ECKERSLEY: Yes, it's exactly the quality we've been searching for.
We're just not producing enough of it. <br>
(He gives it back to a Peladon, then his alien companion speaks. He is
shorter, with ginger hair and bushy beard, and a hairy pair of
trousers. His eyes are very large and he is bare-chested.) <br>
NEXOS: How can we? We have modern equipment but these primitives refuse
to use it. <br>
ECKERSLEY: Oh, they'll come round to it. At least they've agreed to use
the sonic lance. <br>
(The frightened Peladons run past.) <br>
ECKERSLEY: What's going on? Hey, Ettis. What's all the panic? <br>
ETTIS: It's Aggedor. <br>
ECKERSLEY: What? <br>
ETTIS: It's the spirit of Aggedor! We took the sonic lance down into
the mine as you ordered, and the spirit of Aggedor appeared and slew
one of us for blasphemy! Who do you think's going to use your alien
equipment now?
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The young King has been replaced by a young
Queen.) <br>
ORTRON: One of our people has been killed. The miners are terrified and
refuse to work. What explanation do you offer us? <br>
ECKERSLEY: It's not up to me to explain, is it? According to the
miners, it was the spirit of Aggedor, whatever that's supposed to mean.
<br>
ORTRON: Do not blaspheme, alien. <br>
(A familiar one eyed, six armed entity wearing a curtain comes
forward.) <br>
ALPHA: I'm sure no disrespect was intended, Lord Chancellor. <br>
NEXOS: Your Majesty, we people of the planet Vega are a practical race
of mining engineers. We do not propose to accept that this unfortunate
incident was brought about by supernatural means. <br>
THALIRA: (the young Queen) The miners of Peladon say that Aggedor
appeared to them. <br>
NEXOS: Your Majesty, your miners are primitive and superstitious. <br>
ORTRON: Then what is your explanation? <br>
NEXOS: Sabotage. <br>
ORTRON: And where are these saboteurs? <br>
ECKERSLEY: Yes, well, sabotage or spooks, the end result's the same. We
had just about persuaded your miners to accept the use of the sonic
lance and now they won't touch any of the modern equipment. <br>
THALIRA: The use of the sonic lance is essential to you? <br>
ECKERSLEY: Oh yes, your Majesty. It will increase the output tenfold. <br>
THALIRA: Could you arrange an immediate demonstration of the sonic
lance? <br>
ORTRON: Your Majesty <br>
THALIRA: If our people see that we have faith in your technology, it
may help to calm their fears. <br>
NEXOS: Of course, your Majesty. We will arrange it immediately. <br>
ALPHA: Allow me to thank your Majesty on behalf of the Federation. A
most helpful gesture. The sooner we can achieve full production of
trisilicate, the sooner we can bring this dreadful war to a successful
conclusion. <br>
THALIRA: Thank you, Ambassador. The audience is at an end. <br>
ALPHA: Thank you, your Majesty. <br>
ECKERSLEY: Your Majesty. <br>
(Alpha, Eckersley and Nexos leave.) <br>
ORTRON: Your Majesty, I must protest! I can control this situation. I
do not want you exposed to danger. <br>
THALIRA: You know as well as I, Ortron, it was my father's dream to see
Peladon a civilised planet, a full member of the Federation. He signed
the treaty. We must honour it. <br>
ORTRON: I intend that we should do so. Right from the day Chancellor
Hepesh died, I served your father loyally. I worked for the things he
believed in. Progress, civilisation, the Federation. Now there is war
with Galaxy Five and our people have to make sacrifices. <br>
THALIRA: Yes, but in quarrel not their own. <br>
ORTRON: We have to accept the duties of Federation membership, as well
as the benefits.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Temple]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Like Hepesh before him, Ortron seeks guidance from
a higher power.) <br>
ORTRON: Oh, mighty Aggedor, make known your will. Do not seek vengeance
on your servants. Let your judgment fall on those who have truly
offended thee.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A guard hears a strange sound and takes cover as
the Tardis materialises.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Citadel of Peladon, Sarah. One of the most interesting and <br>
SARAH: Oh no, it isn't, is it, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no, not exactly. <br>
SARAH: No, it's not your precious Citadel at all. It's another rotten
gloomy old tunnel. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, with the scanner still on the blink, there was no
way I could really check. <br>
SARAH: There's more than the scanner on the blink. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's go and see where we are. <br>
(The Doctor and Sarah leave. The guard goes in the opposite direction.
Further along -) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think my spatial coordinates must have slipped a bit,
too. We may not actually be in the Citadel, Sarah, but we're very close
to it. <br>
SARAH: We are? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, the Citadel is built on a mountain, you see, and the
mountain is honeycombed with tunnels like this. Come on. <br>
SARAH: We couldn't just get back in the Tardis and go home? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, have a heart, Sarah. I've been meaning to pay a return
visit to Peladon for ages. <br>
SARAH: I can't think why. <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, Sarah Jane.

escorts Thalira and her guards.) <br>
ORTRON: This way, your Majesty. <br>
(A miner kneels in front of Thalira.) <br>
GEBEK: We are honoured by your presence, your Majesty. <br>
THALIRA: And we are grateful for yours, Gebek. Can you persuade your
miners to overcome their fears and use the new Federation tools? <br>
GEBEK: The demonstration will help, your Majesty, but there has been a
death. Ettis here was <br>
ETTIS: I beg of you, your Majesty, do not permit this blasphemy. I have
seen the wrath of Aggedor! <br>
NEXOS: You have seen enemy spies. Agents from Galaxy Five sent here to
cause trouble. <br>
GEBEK: One of the guards was telling some wild story. He said he saw
more aliens, appearing as if by magic in the tunnels. <br>
ORTRON: Guard. <br>
GEBEK: Since Aggedor's appearance there have been many such stories,
your Majesty. <br>
ORTRON: There are alien spies in the tunnels. Enemies of the Federation
and of Peladon. They must be found and destroyed. <br>
GUARD: My lord.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SARAH: Well, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: This way, I think. <br>
SARAH: We're lost. <br>
DOCTOR: Mislaid, possibly. <br>
SARAH: Oh, why don't we just go back to the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: For two good reasons. One, that I don't want to leave Peladon
without having a word with my good friend, the King. <br>
SARAH: Name dropper. <br>
DOCTOR: And second. <br>
SARAH: What? <br>
DOCTOR: We are lost. Come on.

May we begin? <br>
THALIRA: Please. <br>
ECKERSLEY: Nexos? If you will just keep your eyes on that section of
the wall over there. <br>
(Nexos operates the lance. The rock wall begins to tremble as the sound
rises in pitch. The dish sends out a red light and a nice circular hole
appears in the rock.) <br>
ECKERSLEY: There we are, your Majesty. Direct access to the main seam
within a matter of moments. Now that would take us weeks to do a job
like that by hand. <br>
(The strange noise starts up again. Nexos walks up to the new tunnel
mouth.) <br>
NEXOS: Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid. It is trickery! There is
nothing to fear. <br>
(Nexos enters the new tunnel.) <br>
ECKERSLEY: Don't be a fool. Come back! <br>
(There is a red glow and Nexos is thrown back out with a cry before his
body vanishes completely. The miners run.) <br>
ECKERSLEY: Oh, God. <br>
ETTIS: It is the curse of Aggedor. Now will you believe?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Cheer up, Sarah. We're nearly there. I
recognise this tunnel. <br>
(The rough walls with roots growing through give way to neat
stonework.) <br>
SARAH: As far as I'm concerned, Doctor, a tunnel is a tunnel is a
tunnel. <br>
GUARD [OC]: Come on here, lads. Down this way! <br>
SARAH: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: That'll be the palace guard. We'll be all right now. <br>
SARAH: Well, let's not be rash, hmm? <br>
GUARD: There they are! Two of them! <br>
(Sarah runs away.) <br>
SARAH: Run, Doctor, quick! <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah! Sarah! <br>
(They are chased down the tunnel by three guards to a dead end with a
torch in a metal scone.) <br>
SARAH: We're trapped! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, we're not. Look. <br>
(The Doctor moves the torch and the hidden door opens.) <br>
DOCTOR: Go on, in you go.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: The temple of Aggedor in the Citadel of
Peladon. <br>
SARAH: I believed you. Oh, it is very impressive, Doctor. But what
about those guards? I thought you said they were friendly here. <br>
DOCTOR: There must have been a misunderstanding. Probably startled. <br>
SARAH: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, look at old Aggedor. There he is, bless him. <br>
SARAH: He doesn't look very lovable to me. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, that's just a statue. You wait till you've seen the real
animal. <br>
SARAH: The real animal? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, didn't I tell you about my first visit to Peladon? <br>
SARAH: Oh, no, not properly. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Peladon was just on the point of entering the galactic
Federation, you see, when suddenly they started having this trouble. <br>
SARAH: Not now, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh well, of course, if you don't want to hear about it. <br>
SARAH: It's not that, Doctor. I think we're about to have some trouble
of our own. (The guards knew about the secret door and are standing
behind the Doctor with their swords drawn.)

Peladon turns up <br>
GUARD: Silence! <br>
(Ortron leads Thalira, her woman in waiting and her Champion in. The
Doctor and Sarah are forced to kneel.) <br>
ORTRON: Aliens, you are accused both of sacrilege and of sabotage. Do
you confess? <br>
SARAH: No, we don't. I don't know what you're talk <br>
ORTRON: Silence! I addressed your master. <br>
SARAH: He is not my master! <br>
ORTRON: Well, alien? <br>
DOCTOR: May I first know whom I have the honour of addressing? <br>
ORTRON: I am Ortron, High Priest and Chancellor. This is her Majesty,
Queen Thalira of Peladon. <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty. But, er, where is King Peladon? <br>
THALIRA: He was my father. He died when I was a child. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. That explains a great deal. <br>
ORTRON: Alien, name those who sent you and your life may be spared. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, in a moment, old chap. Your Majesty, I <br>
(The Doctor steps forward and is stopped by the guards.) <br>
DOCTOR: Your Majesty, your father and I were very good friends before
you were born. I am the Doctor. <br>
THALIRA: But I have heard stories of the Doctor ever since I was a
child. <br>
ORTRON: Everyone on Peladon knows the story of the Doctor. What better
disguise for an alien spy and saboteur? <br>
DOCTOR: You really are a suspicious fellow, aren't you? <br>
ALPHA: Your Majesty, I cannot tell you how shocked I was to hear <br>
SARAH: Doctor! What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: The answer to all our troubles, Sarah. <br>
ALPHA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Alpha Centauri. <br>
ALPHA: It is! It's the Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Alpha Centauri, my dear fellow, what a very well-timed
entrance. <br>
ALPHA: It's like a miracle, Doctor. All these years and you haven't
changed a bit. <br>
DOCTOR: Neither have you, my dear fellow. A touch of grey around the
tentacles perhaps, but still the same old Alpha. <br>
ORTRON: Ambassador? <br>
ALPHA: Oh, forgive me, your Majesty. <br>
THALIRA: Ambassador, we take it that these aliens are known to you? <br>
ALPHA: Er, not the er, female? Not the female, your Majesty. Still,
she's of no importance. But this is most certainly the Doctor. A good
friend of your father, and of Peladon. <br>
ORTRON: The past history of this alien is irrelevant. <br>
ALPHA: I'm sure there has been a misunderstanding, your Majesty. I am
prepared to vouch for the Doctor. <br>
THALIRA: Very well. The charges will be suspended and the aliens
released into your custody, Ambassador. <br>
ORTRON: Your Majesty! <br>
THALIRA: But we shall expect a full report of their behaviour, and of
their presence on Peladon. <br>
ALPHA: Of course, your Majesty. Thank you, your Majesty. <br>
SARAH: Well I don't think that's good enough. What about an apology for
the <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah, Sarah. <br>
ALPHA: Doctor, come with me, please. <br>
SARAH: Hey! <br>
ALPHA: You may bring the female. <br>
SARAH: Thanks. <br>
(Alpha, the Doctor and Sarah leave.) <br>
ORTRON: Your Majesty, it is not wise to trust this alien. Even if he is
the Doctor, he was the one who persuaded King Peladon to join the
Federation and caused our present troubles. Now why has he come here
again? <br>
THALIRA: We shall not learn the Doctor's plans by having him executed,
Ortron. If he is our enemy, he will soon betray himself.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ETTIS: Gebek, for the last time, listen to me.
Even if you do speak to the Queen, it will do no good. She and Ortron
are puppets of the Federation. <br>
GEBEK: We must try. <br>
ETTIS: If talks fail, Gebek, we fight. <br>
GEBEK: There will be no fighting. Now, you will all wait for me here.
When I've spoken to the Queen, we'll talk again. <br>
(Gebek leaves.) <br>
ETTIS: Gebek's a good man, but he's too patient. We'll give him time to
get clear, then, while he talks, we'll fight.

should put up with it. And as for your friend here. The female is of no
importance, indeed. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I thought that would rankle a bit. <br>
SARAH: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Actually, you owe Alpha Centauri a very great deal of
gratitude. Without him you'd have been lucky to have got out of there
alive. They go in for rough justice here on Peladon, you know. Chop off
your head and apologise afterwards. <br>
SARAH: Yes, well, if you hadn't missed the target by about five hundred
yards and fifty years, we wouldn't be in this mess. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a point. <br>

to those of your kind. <br>
GEBEK: Reserved for you and your high and mighty nobles and our real
masters, the Federation aliens, of course. <br>
ORTRON: Do not be insolent, Gebek. You may have a little authority
amongst your miners but you are still one of them. Why did you come
here? <br>
GEBEK: I must speak with the Queen. <br>
ORTRON: You should have requested an audience. <br>
GEBEK: Things are too urgent for that. I must speak with the Queen now,

DOCTOR: Well it seems to me, Eckersley, the Federation has brought a
lot of its troubles on itself. <br>
ALPHA: That is unfair, Doctor. There have been many difficulties. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, it's fifty years now since Peladon joined the Galactic
Federation, and what have the miners got to show for it? Harder work
for the same rewards. <br>
ALPHA: Peladon is a feudal society, Doctor. The court is resistant to
any change. <br>
ECKERSLEY: And we have got to step up the production of trisilicate.
It's essential to our war effort. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's another thing that concerns me, this war. I
thought the Federation was dedicated to peace? <br>
ECKERSLEY: So it is, Doctor. <br>
ALPHA: But we were the victims of a vicious and unprovoked attack by
the forces of Galaxy Five. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you tried to negotiate? <br>
ALPHA: Many times. They refuse to listen. <br>
SARAH: Well, what's so important about this trisilicate stuff? <br>
ECKERSLEY: Our whole technology is based on it. Electronic circuitry,
heat shields, inert microcell fibres, radionic crystals. And whoever
the supply of trisilicate will win this war. <br>
SARAH: And you think someone's trying to stop you getting it? <br>
ECKERSLEY: That's what Vega Nexos thought. Saboteurs, agents from
Galaxy Five. <br>
DOCTOR: It's possible, I suppose. <br>

they staying undetected? <br>

there. <br>
SARAH: You'll be in trouble if they do get through. <br>

some guards to finish them off. <br>

watch them get cut down? Well, can't you stop it? <br>

out of the door. As Preba comes close, the Doctor grabs his sword arm
and Eckersley grabs the weapon.) <br>

ALPHA: You see the dangers we face, Doctor? Peladon is still a
barbarous and primitive planet. <br>

probably have their reasons. I'd like to know what those reasons are. <br>

species rather frightening. Yet I assure you, we are an amiable and
peace loving race. <br>

DOCTOR: Now just one moment. I brought this man here to talk to the
Queen. <br>

They have invaded the Citadel and carried arms against your Majesty.
The law demands their execution! Take them away! <br>

stands in front of the Queen. The Doctor easily takes a pike from
another guard who rushes forward and slips on the tiled floor. Gebek
and Preba get away, and the Doctor is surrounded.) <br>

helped them escape, you shall die in their place. <br>

DOCTOR: Your Majesty, as you know, the miners are already on the point
of armed rebellion. How would they react if their leader was killed by
the Queen's guards? He'd become a martyr, a figurehead for a people's
revolution. Revolution and civil war, your Majesty, unless you allow me
to help you. <br>
THALIRA: But how can you help us? <br>
DOCTOR: By proving my belief that the appearances of Aggedor are caused
by trickery. <br>
THALIRA: Very well. We will trust you, Doctor, for the present.
Captain. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, your Majesty. I'd like to begin by inspecting where
Aggedor last appeared, so if someone could show me the way? <br>

the last thing that he wants. <br>

was only crowned because my father had no son. It's Ortron who holds

directional heat ray. The projector sends an image of that, and the
heat ray does the damage. <br>
GEBEK: The appearances of Aggedor were all done from here? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. By Eckersley or one of his Ice Warrior
friends. Very clever piece of work this. Quite an engineer, our friend
Eckersley. <br>
(Sskel arrives outside and finds the fallen Ice Warrior. He uses his
weapon on the metal door.) <br>

for this betrayal. <br>

richest and the most powerful man in the galaxy. <br>
