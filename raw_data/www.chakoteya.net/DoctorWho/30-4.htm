a woman out of the main building. They are followed by a slim-built
teenager with the voice and demeanour of a young Bill Gates.) <br>
MAN: Come on. Stop struggling. <br>
JO: You're going to regret this. Completely ridiculous. Get your hands
off me! <br>
(They throw her to the ground, then toss her papers on top of her.) <br>
RATTIGAN: I think that makes my answer clear, don't you? Oh. And, er,
if you're going to
go to print, spell my name right. Rattigan, with two Ts. <br>
JO: Oh, this goes way beyond the newspapers. This thing's worldwide.
I'm telling you, ATMOS is dangerous. <br>
RATTIGAN: But if you had proof, then you wouldn't be here. <br>
JO: Fine. If you won't listen, I'll find someone else who will. <br>
(Jo gathers up her papers and gets into her car. There is an ATMOS
sticker on the windscreen.)

JO: Right then. Take me to UNIT Headquarters. Tower Bridge, London. <br>

RATTIGAN: Her name's Jo Nakashima. A freelance journalist. Clever by
the sound of it, but not as clever as me. But that goes without saying.

(His room has a lot of sports stuff in it, including a surf board and
squash racket.) <br>

message to Colonel Mace from Jo. Jo Nakashima. Look, you should have
got my email. I've been investigating a number of deaths related to
ATMOS systems. <br>
ATMOS: Go straight on. <br>
JO: Now, I can't prove anything, but there's got to be a link. I need
you to check out all the people who died in ATMOS cars yesterday, and
then check out the time. <br>
ATMOS: Turn right. <br>
(Jo obeys the mechanical voice and finds herself on a piece of rough
ground by the river.) <br>
JO: I don't believe this. <br>
ATMOS: This is your final destination. <br>
JO: I said, take me to UNIT. <br>
ATMOS: Go straight on. <br>
JO: I don't think so. I'll find my own way, thanks. <br>

take control again.) <br>

DONNA: What am I going to do, put a dent in them? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, someone did. <br>

don't fight. Can't bear fighting. <br>
DONNA: You wish. <br>
(The women shake hands.) <br>
DONNA: I've heard all about you. He talks about you all the time. <br>
MARTHA: I dread to think. <br>
DONNA: No, no, no. No, ne says nice things. Good things. Nice things.
Really good things. <br>
MARTHA: Oh my God. He's told you everything. <br>
DONNA: Didn't take long to get over it though. Who's the lucky man? <br>
DOCTOR: What man? Lucky what? <br>
DONNA: She's engaged, you prawn. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Who to? <br>
MARTHA: Tom. That Tom Milligan. He's in pediatrics. Working out in
Africa right now. And yes, I know, I've got a doctor who disappears off
to distant places. Tell me about it. <br>
DONNA: Is he skinny? <br>
MARTHA: No, he's sort of strong. <br>
DONNA: He is too skinny for words. You give him a hug, you get a paper
cut. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'd rather you were fighting. <br>
MARTHA: Speaking of which. <br>
WOMAN [OC]: Doctor Jones, report to base, please. Over. <br>
(Martha answers her walkie-talkie.) <br>
MARTHA: This is Doctor Jones. Operation Blue Sky is go, go, go. I
repeat, this is a go. <br>
(A convoy of jeeps, trucks and a squad of the Parachute Regiment go
past.) <br>
SOLDIER: Unified Intelligence Taskforce. Raise that barrier, now! (A
car with Army top brass goes past, and they all go to the ATMOS
factory.) <br>
SOLDIER: Leave those safeties on, lads. They're non-hostiles. <br>
TANNOY: All workers, lay down your tools and surrender. <br>
MARTHA: Greyhound Six to Trap One. B Section, go, go, go. Search the
ground floor. Grid pattern delta. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you searching for? <br>
MARTHA: Illegal aliens. <br>
TANNOY: This is a UNIT operation. All workers lay down your tools and
surrender immediately. <br>
MARTHA: B section mobilised. E section, F section, on my command. <br>
(Martha runs off to join the troops under her command.) <br>

SKREE: As predicted, the UNIT forces have moved to the penultimate

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTHA: Operation Blue Sky complete, sir. Thanks
for letting me take the lead. And, this is the Doctor. Doctor, Colonel
Mace. <br>
MACE: Sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't salute. <br>
MACE: But it's an honour, sir. I've read all the files on you.
Technically speaking, you're still on staff. You never resigned. <br>
DONNA: What, you used to work for them? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, long time ago. Back in the 70's. Or was it the 80's? But
it was all a bit more homespun back then. <br>
MACE: Times have changed, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's enough of the sir. <br>
MARTHA: Come on, though, Doctor. You've seen it. You've been on board
the Valiant. We've got massive funding from the United Nations, all in
the name of Home World Security. <br>
MACE: A modern UNIT for the modern world. <br>
DONNA: What, and that means arresting ordinary factory workers, in the
streets, in broad daylight? It's more like Guantanamo Bay out there.
Donna, by the way. Donna Noble, since you didn't ask. I'll have a
salute. <br>
(Mace looks at the Doctor, who gives a sort of nod, so the Colonel
salutes Donna.) <br>
MACE: Ma'am. <br>
DONNA: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, what's going on in that factory? <br>
MACE: Yesterday, fifty two people died in identical circumstances,
right across the world, in eleven different time zones. Five a.m. in
the UK, six a.m. in France, eight a.m. in Moscow, one p.m. in China. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean they died simultaneously. <br>
MACE: Exactly. Fifty two deaths at the exact same moment, worldwide. <br>
DOCTOR: How did they die? <br>
MACE: They were all inside their cars. <br>
MARTHA: They were poisoned. I checked the biopsies. No toxins. Whatever
it is, left the system immediately. <br>
DOCTOR: What have the cars got in common? <br>
MARTHA: Completely different makes. They're all fitted with ATMOS, and
that is the ATMOS factory. <br>
DOCTOR: What's ATMOS? <br>
DONNA: Oh, come on. Even I know that. Everyone's got ATMOS. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[ATMOS factory]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARTHA: Stands for Atmospheric Omission System. Fit
ATMOS in your car, it reduces CO2 emissions to zero. <br>
DOCTOR: Zero? No carbon, none at all? <br>
DONNA: And you get sat-nav and twenty quid in shopping vouchers if you
introduce a friend. Bargain. <br>
MACE: And this is where they make it, Doctor. Shipping worldwide.
Seventeen factories across the globe, but this is the central depot,
sending ATMOS to every country on Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: And you think ATMOS is alien. <br>
MACE: It's our job to investigate that possibility. Doctor? <br>
(The paratroopers are still rounding up workers as Mace leads them
through a plastic strip curtain.) <br>
SOLDIER: Come on, look lively. Up the pace, go on. We haven't got all
day now.

MACE: And here it is, laid bare. ATMOS can be threaded through any and
every make of car. <br>
DOCTOR: You must've checked it, before it went on sale. <br>
MARTHA: We did. We found nothing. That's why I thought we needed an
expert. <br>
DOCTOR: Really. who'd you get? Oh, right. Me, yes. Good. <br>
(Martha and Mace leave.) <br>
DONNA: Okay. So why would aliens be so keen on cleaning up our
atmosphere? <br>
DOCTOR: A very good question. <br>
DONNA: Maybe they want to help. Get rid of pollution and stuff. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you know how many cars there are on planet Earth? Eight
hundred million. Imagine that. If you could control them, you'd have
eight hundred million weapons. </font></p>

(His companion walks into a corridor and the overhead lights come on.) <br>
HARRIS: Aye, aye. What's this, then? <br>
(Two workers are standing guard by the door at the end.) <br>
HARRIS: You two. All personnel have been ordered to evacuate. The

corridor, north side, grid thirty six. Request backup, over. <br>
(They go over to a lidded bath with a long trolley next to it.) <br>
HARRIS: It's like something boiling inside. <br>
GRAY: Don't touch it. <br>
HARRIS: Come on, Steve. We get first rights on this. That means
promotion. <br>
GRAY: Just leave it alone. Wait for backup. <br>
(There is a bang from inside the bath.) <br>
GRAY: What was that? <br>
HARRIS: It came from inside. <br>
GRAY: Could just be the machinery. <br>
(Bang. Bang.) <br>
HARRIS: Is there someone in there? Hello? We've got to get this open. <br>
GRAY: We should wait for the others. <br>
HARRIS: You could suffocate in there. <br>
GRAY: Greyhound Sixteen to Trap One, request immediate assistance.
Repeat, immediate assistance, over. <br>
HARRIS: How do you work this thing? Come on. <br>
(An alarm sounds as the lid rises up on four pulleys. The bath contains
bubbling green liquid.) <br>
GRAY: Oh God, it stinks. <br>
HARRIS: What the hell is that stuff? <br>
(A bland, naked body rises out of the liquid and tries to touch Harris.
It has no eyes and an incomplete mouth.) <br>
GRAY: Identify yourself! Identify! Greyhound Sixteen declaring Absolute
emergency, sir. Repeat, Absolute emergency. Over. <br>
HARRIS: Can you hear me? Can you understand me? Look at its neck. Looks
like an umbilical cord. <br>
GRAY: Well, don't get too close. <br>
HARRIS: I think it's harmless. I don't even think it's properly alive. <br>
(The being goes back underneath the liquid.) <br>
GRAY: It's going to drown. <br>
HARRIS: No. I think it breathes this stuff, like some kind of embryo. <br>
GRAY: What do you mean, an embryo? <br>
HARRIS: Someone's growing a body. A human body. <br>
STAAL [OC]: Excellent skills of deduction. <br>
(They turn their weapons on a squat armoured figure with no neck and
three fingers. Yes, it is a Sontaran.) <br>
STAAL: I would rate you above average, soldier. Well done. Whereas you,
you smell of sweat and fear. <br>
HARRIS: Yeah? Well, we're not the ones who got out of school early,
sonny. Now stop playing Humpty Dumpty and tell us who you are. <br>
STAAL: Is that a reference to my height? <br>
HARRIS: Short answer, yes. <br>
STAAL: A pity. Words are the weapons of womenfolk. I must judge you
unfit. <br>
HARRIS: Oh, what you going to do, bite our ankles? <br>
(Staal fires his stick weapon at Harris's ankle.) <br>
GRAY: I'm warning you! <br>
STAAL: A proper soldier gives no warning. Fire. I order you. Fire. <br>
(Gray's semi-automatic does not fire.) <br>
STAAL: The room is contained within a cordolaine signal, exciting the
copper surface of the bullet and causing expansion within the barrel,
rendering your guns useless. And your radio signals have been blocked. <br>
(Gray tries to use his gun as a club, but Staal zaps him.) <br>
GRAY: My legs. I can't feel my legs. <br>
(The workers enter.) <br>
STAAL: I apologise for disabling you. Death has more honour, but you
are needed for the stratagem. Prepare them for processing. You spoke of
promotion. Now you will serve a greater cause. <br>
HARRIS: Who are you? <br>
STAAL: Indeed, know your enemy. I am General Staal of the Tenth
Sontaran Battle Fleet. Known as Staal the Undefeated. <br>

DOCTOR: Ionising nano-membrane carbon dioxide converter. Which means
that ATMOS works. Filters the CO2 at a molecular level. <br>
MACE: We know all that, but what's its origin? Is it alien? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Decades ahead of its time. Look, do you mind? Could you
stand back a bit? <br>
MACE: Sorry, have I done something wrong? <br>

MARTHA: If anyone got me used to fighting, it's you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh right, so it's my fault. <br>
MARTHA: Well, you got me the job. Besides, look at me. Am I carrying a
gun? <br>
DOCTOR: Suppose not. <br>
MARTHA: It's all right for you. You can just come and go, but some of
us have got to stay behind. So I've got to work from the inside, and by
staying inside, maybe I stand a chance of making them better. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah? That's more like Martha Jones. <br>
MARTHA: I learned from the best. <br>
DOCTOR: Well. <br>

DONNA: Oi, you lot. All your storm troopers and your sonics. You're
rubbish. Should've come with me. <br>
DOCTOR: Why, where have you been? <br>
DONNA: Personnel. That's where the weird stuff's happening, in the
paperwork. Because I spent years working as a temp, I can find my way
round an office blindfold, and the first thing I noticed is an empty
file. <br>
DOCTOR: Why, what's inside it? Or what's not inside it? <br>
DONNA: Sick days. There aren't any. Hundreds of people working here and
no one's sick. Not one hangover, man flu, sneaky little shopping trip,
nothing. Not ever. They don't get ill. <br>

best to keep a super-duper time machine away from the front lines. <br>

face their enemies in battle. Isn't that brilliant? They can never turn
