<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(On a glittering alien world, an attendant brings a
telephone to Donna. She is lounging by the pool, wearing a
bathrobe.) <br>
DONNA: I said, no. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Public telephone]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Sapphire waterfall. It's a waterfall made
of sapphires. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR [OC]: This enormous jewel, the size of a
glacier </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion, and then
shatters into sapphires at the edge. They fall a hundred thousand feet
into a crystal ravine. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Oh, come on. They're boarding now. It's no
fun if I see it on me own. Four hours, that's all it takes. <br>
DONNA [OC]: No, that's four hours there and four hours back. That's
like a school trip. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Spa]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DONNA: I'd rather go sunbathing. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: You be careful, that's Xtonic sunlight. <br>
DONNA: Oh, I'm safe. It says in the brochure this glass is fifteen feet
thick. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: All right, I give up. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Public telephone]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: I'll be back for dinner. We'll try that
anti-gravity restaurant. With bibs. <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DONNA: Well, not a date. Oh, you know what I mean.

strangers across a diamond planet called Midnight? What could possibly
go wrong? <br>
He hangs the phone up.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor has taken his seat in the passenger
compartment of the bus cum aeroplane. Other passengers are still
boarding.) <br>
HOSTESS: Complimentary juice pack and complimentary peanuts. <br>
SKY: Just the headphones, please. <br>
HOSTESS: There you go. <br>
(The hostess leaves the woman in the blue suit and goes to the Doctor.)
<br>
HOSTESS: That's the headphones for channels one to thirty six. Modem
link for 3D vidgames. Complimentary earplugs. Complimentary slippers.
Complimentary juice pack and complimentary peanuts. I must warn you
some products may contain nuts. <br>
DOCTOR: That'll be the peanuts. <br>
HOSTESS: Enjoy your trip. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I can't wait. Allons-y. <br>
HOSTESS: I'm sorry? <br>
DOCTOR: It's French, for let's go. <br>
HOSTESS: Fascinating. <br>
(The Second Doctor's son, David Troughton, and his petite Indian
assistant have taken the seats behind the Doctor.) <br>
HOSTESS: Headphones for channels one to thirty six. <br>
HOBBES: Oh no, thank you, not for us. <br>
DEE DEE: Earplugs, please. <br>
HOSTESS: There you go. <br>
HOBBES: They call it the Sapphire Waterfall, but it's no such thing.
Sapphire's an aluminium oxide, but the glacier is just compound silica
with iron pigmentation. <br>
(The hostess moves on to a couple, man and woman.) <br>
HOSTESS: Complimentary juice pack and complimentary peanuts. <br>
VAL: Thank you. <br>
HOBBES: Have you got that pillow for my neck? <br>
DEE DEE: Yes, sir. <br>
HOBBES: And the pills? <br>
DEE DEE: Yes, all measured out for you. There you go. <br>
(Hobbes leans over to meet the Doctor.) <br>
HOBBES: Hobbes. Professor Winfold Hobbes. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. Hello. <br>
HOBBES: It's my fourteenth time. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. My first. <br>
DEE DEE: And I'm Dee Dee, Dee Dee Blasco. <br>
HOBBES: Don't bother the man. Where's my water bottle? <br>
HOSTESS: Complimentary slippers, complimentary juice pack, and
complimentary peanuts. I must warn you some products may contain nuts. <br>
(A teenage boy is sitting across the aisle from his parents.) <br>
VAL: Don't be silly. Come and sit with us. Look, we get slippers. <br>
BIFF: Jethro. Do what your mother says. <br>
JETHRO: I'm sitting here. <br>
BIFF: Oh, he's ashamed of us, but he doesn't mind us paying, does he? <br>
VAL: Oh, don't you two start. Should I save the juice pack or have it
now? Look, peach and clementine. <br>
(Boarding is complete.) <br>
HOSTESS: Ladies and gentlemen, and variations thereupon, welcome on
board the Crusader Fifty. If you would fasten your seatbelts, we'll be
leaving any moment. Doors. <br>
(The doors close.) <br>
HOSTESS: Shields down. <br>
(The windows are shielded.)<br>
HOSTESS: I'm afraid the view is shielded until we reach the Waterfall
Palace. Also, a reminder. Midnight has no air, so please don't touch
the exterior door seals. Fire exit at the rear, and should we need to
use it, you first. Now I will hand you over to Driver Joe. <br>
JOE [OC]: Driver Joe at the wheel. There's been a diamondfall at the
Winter Witch Canyon, so we'll be taking a slight detour, as you'll see
on the map. The journey covers five hundred kliks to the Multifaceted
Coast. Duration is estimated at four hours. Thank you for travelling
with us, and as they used to say in the olden days, wagons roll. <br>
(The shuttle shakes a bit.) <br>
HOSTESS: For your entertainment, we have the Music Channel playing
retrovids of Earth classics. <br>
(Dropdown screens show a pop video of some woman.) <br>
HOSTESS: Also, the latest artistic installation from Ludovico Klein. <br>
(Something holographic.) <br>
HOSTESS: Plus, for the youngsters, a rare treat. The Animation
Archives. <br>
(A projection of Betty Boop onto a screen in front of the drivers cabin
door.) <br>
HOSTESS: Four hours of fun time. Enjoy. <br>
(That is why she hands out earplugs. Sky looks up from her book, very
unhappy. The Doctor powers up his sonic screwdriver and suddenly it
goes quiet. The screens return to their docks.) <br>
HOBBES: Well, that's a mercy. <br>
HOSTESS: I do apologise, ladies and gentlemen, and variations
thereupon. We seem to had a failure of the Entertainment System. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
VAL: But what do we do? <br>
BIFF: We've got four hours of this? Four hours of just sitting here? <br>
DOCTOR: Tell you what. We'll have to talk to each other instead. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[98 kliks later...]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The idea has caught on. Everyone is listening to
Val and Biff's stories.) <br>
VAL: So Biff said, I'm going swimming. <br>
BIFF: Oh, I was all ready. Trunks and everything. Nose plug. <br>
VAL: He had this little nose plug. You should have seen him. <br>
BIFF: And I went marching up to the lifeguard. And he was a Shamboni.
You know, those big foreheads? <br>
VAL: Great big forehead. <br>
BIFF: And I said, where's the pool? And he said <br>
BIFF + VAL: The pool is abstract. <br>
(Jethro is bored to tears.) <br>
VAL: It wasn't a real pool. <br>
BIFF: It was a concept. <br>
DOCTOR: And you were wearing a nose plug. <br>
BIFF: I was like this. Ooo, where's the pool? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[150 kliks later...]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor and Dee Dee are in the galley, getting
drinks from a thermos jug.) <br>
DEE DEE: I'm just a second-year student, but I wrote a paper on the
Lost Moon of Poosh, Professor Hobbes read it, liked it, took me on as
researcher, just for the holidays. Well, I say researcher. Most of the
time he's got me fetching and carrying. But it's all good experience. <br>
DOCTOR: And did they ever find it? <br>
DEE DEE: Find what? <br>
DOCTOR: The Lost Moon of Poosh. <br>
DEE DEE: Oh, no. Not yet. <br>
DOCTOR: Well. Maybe that'll be your great discovery, one day. Here's to
Poosh. <br>
DEE DEE: Poosh.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is sitting with Sky as they unwrap
their meals.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I'm with this friend of mine, Donna. She stayed behind
in the Leisure Palace. You? <br>
SKY: No, it's just me. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I've done plenty of that. Travelling on my own. I love it.
Do what you want, go anywhere. <br>
SKY: No, I'm still getting used to it. I've found myself single rather
recently, not by choice. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened? <br>
SKY: Oh, the usual. She needed her own space, as they say. A different
galaxy, in fact. I reckon that's enough space, don't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. I had a friend who went to a different universe. <br>
SKY: Oh, what's this, chicken or beef? <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's both.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Professor Hobbes is giving an illustrated lecture.
Even Jethro is interested.) <br>
HOBBES: So, this is Midnight, do you see, bombarded by the sun. Xtonic
rays, raw galvanic radiation. Dee Dee, next slide. It's my pet project.
Actually, I'm the first person to research this. Because, you see, the
history is fascinating. Because there is no history. There's no life in
this entire system. There couldn't be. Before the Leisure Palace
Company moved in, no one had come here in all eternity. No living
thing. <br>
JETHRO: But how do you know? I mean, if no one can go outside. <br>
VAL: Oh, his imagination. Here we go. <br>
DOCTOR: He's got a point, though. <br>
HOBBES: Exactly. We look upon this world through glass, safe inside our
metal box. Even the Leisure Palace was lowered down from orbit. And
here we are now, crossing Midnight, but never touching it. <br>
(Crunch, rattle, grind.) <br>
VAL: We've stopped. Have we stopped? <br>
BIFF: Are we there? <br>
DEE DEE: We can't be, it's too soon. <br>
HOBBES: They don't stop. Crusader vehicles never stop. <br>
HOSTESS: If you could just return to your seats. It's just a small
delay. <br>
(The hostess goes to the intercom phone.) <br>
BIFF: Maybe just a pit stop. <br>
HOSTESS: What's going on? <br>
HOBBES: There's no pit to stop in. I've been on this expedition
fourteen times. They never stop. <br>
SKY: Well, evidently we have stopped, so there's no point in denying
it. <br>
JETHRO: We've broken down. <br>
VAL: Thanks, Jethro. <br>
JETHRO: In the middle of nowhere. <br>
BIFF: That's enough. Now stop it. <br>
HOSTESS: Ladies and gentlemen, and variations thereupon. We're just
experiencing a short delay. The driver needs to stabilise the engine
feeds. It's perfectly routine, so if you could just stay in your seats.
<br>
(The Doctor walks towards the driver's door.) <br>
HOSTESS: No, I'm sorry, sir, I. Could you please? <br>
(The Doctor flashes his psychic paper.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you go. Engine expert. Two ticks. <br>
(The Doctor opens the driver's door.) <br>
HOSTESS: I'm sorry, sir. if you could just sit down. You're not
supposed to be in there.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There are two men in the compartment.) <br>
JOE: Sorry. If you could return to your seat, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Company insurance. Let's see if we can get an early assessment.
So, what's the problem, Driver Joe? <br>
JOE: We're stabilising the engine feeds. Won't take long. <br>
DOCTOR: Er, no, because that's the engine feed, that line there, and
it's fine. And it's a micropetrol engine, so stabilising doesn't really
make sense, does it? Sorry. I'm the Doctor, I'm very clever. So, what's
wrong? <br>
CLAUDE: We just stopped. Look, all systems fine, everything's working,
but we're not moving. <br>
(The Doctor scans with his screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, you're right. No faults. And who are you? <br>
CLAUDE: Claude. I'm the mechanic. Trainee. <br>
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you. <br>
JOE: I've sent a distress signal. They should dispatch a rescue truck,
top speed. <br>
DOCTOR: How long till they get here? <br>
JOE: About an hour. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, since we're waiting, shall we take a look outside? Just
lift the screens a bit? <br>
JOE: It's a hundred percent Xtonic out there. We'd be vaporised. <br>
DOCTOR: Nah. Those windows are Finitoglass. They'd give you a couple of
minutes. Go on, live a little. <br>
JOE: Well. <br>
(He raises the front screen.) <br>
JOE: Wow. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that is beautiful. <br>
CLAUDE: Look at all those diamonds. Poisoned by the sun. No-one can
ever touch them. <br>
DOCTOR: Joe, you said we took a detour? <br>
JOE: Just about forty kliks to the west. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that a recognised path? <br>
JOE: No, it's a new one. The computer worked it out on automatic. <br>
DOCTOR: So we're the first. This piece of ground. No one's ever been
here before. Not in the whole of recorded history. <br>
CLAUDE: Did you just? No, sorry, it's nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: What did you see? <br>
CLAUDE: Just there. That ridge. Like, like a shadow. Just, just for a
second. <br>
DOCTOR: What sort of shadow? <br>
(Beep, beep, beep) <br>
JOE: Xtonic rising. Shields down. <br>
CLAUDE: Look, look. There it is, there it is. Look, there. <br>
DOCTOR: Where? What was it? <br>
(The shields close.) <br>
CLAUDE: Like just something shifting. Something sort of dark, like it
was running. <br>
DOCTOR: Running which way? <br>
CLAUDE: Towards us. <br>
JOE: Right, Doctor, back to your seat. And, er, not a word. Rescue's on
its way. If you could close the door. Thank you.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Shuttle]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sky is waiting by the door as the Doctor comes
out.) <br>
SKY: What did they say? Did they tell you? What is it? What's wrong? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just stabilising. Happens all the time. <br>
SKY: I don't need this. I'm on a schedule. This is completely
unnecessary. <br>
HOSTESS: Back to your seats, thank you. <br>
(The hostess goes into the cockpit.) <br>
DEE DEE: Excuse me, Doctor, but they're micropetrol engines, aren't
they? <br>
HOBBES: Now, don't bother the man. <br>
DEE DEE: My father was a mechanic. Micropetrol doesn't stabilise. What
does stabilise mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Well. Bit of flim-flam. Don't worry, they're sorting it out. <br>
HOBBES: So it's not the engines? <br>
DOCTOR: It's just a little pause, that's all. <br>
HOBBES: How much air have we got? <br>
DOCTOR: Professor, it's fine. <br>
VAL: What did he say? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. <br>
VAL: Are we running out of air? <br>
(The hostess reenters the compartment.) <br>
HOBBES: I was just speculating. <br>
BIFF: Is that right, miss? Are we running out of air? <br>
VAL: Is that what the Captain said? <br>
HOSTESS: If you could all just remain calm. <br>
VAL: How much air have we got? <br>
JETHRO: Mum, just stop it. <br>
HOSTESS: I assure you, everything is under control. <br>
BIFF: Well, doesn't look like it to me. <br>
VAL: Well, he said it. <br>
DEE DEE: It's fine. The air is on a circular filter. <br>
VAL: He started it <br>
(General hubbub.) <br>
DOCTOR: Everyone! Quiet! Thank you. Now, if you'd care to listen to my
good friend Dee Dee. <br>
DEE DEE: Oh. Er, it's just that, well, the air's on a circular filter,
so we could stay breathing for ten years. <br>
DOCTOR: There you go. And I've spoken to the Captain. I can guarantee
you everything's fine. <br>
(Thump, thump.) <br>
VAL: What was that? <br>
HOBBES: It must be the metal. We're cooling down. It's just settling. <br>
DEE DEE: Rocks. It could be rocks falling. <br>
BIFF: What I want to know is, how long do we have to sit here. <br>
(Thump, thump, on another part of the hull.) <br>
SKY: What is that? <br>
VAL: There's someone out there. <br>
HOBBES: Now, don't be ridiculous. <br>
DEE DEE: Like I said, it could be rocks. <br>
HOSTESS: We're out in the open. Nothing could fall against the sides. <br>
(Thump, thump.) <br>
DOCTOR: Knock, knock. <br>
JETHRO: Who's there? <br>
SKY: Is there something out there? Well? Anyone? <br>
(Thump, thump). <br>
SKY: What the hell is making that noise? <br>
HOBBES: I'm sorry, but the light out there is Xtonic. That means it
would destroy any living thing in a split second. It is impossible for
someone to be outside. <br>
(Thump, thump.) <br>
SKY: Well, what the hell is that, then? <br>
HOSTESS: Sir, you really should get back to your seat. <br>
(The Doctor uses his stethoscope on the hull.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hello? <br>
(Thump, thump. Quicker now.) <br>
JETHRO: It's moving. <br>
(The emergency exit rattles.) <br>
VAL: It's trying the door. <br>
HOBBES: There is no it. There's nothing out there. Can't be. <br>
(More trying of the emergency exit, then two thumps on the roof, and
two more on the entrance door.) <br>
VAL: That's the entrance. Can it get in? <br>
DEE DEE: No. That door's on two hundred weight hydraulics. <br>
HOBBES: Stop it. Don't encourage them. <br>
DEE DEE: What do you think it is? <br>
VAL: Biff, don't. <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Cane. Better not. <br>
BIFF: Nah, it's cast iron, that door. <br>
(Biff knocks three times, and gets three thumps in reply.) <br>
VAL: Three times. Did you hear that? It did it three times. <br>
JETHRO: It answered. <br>
VAL: It did it three times! <br>
DOCTOR: All right, all right, all right. Everyone calm down. <br>
SKY: No, but it answered. It answered. Don't tell me that thing's not
alive. It answered him. <br>
(Thump, thump, thump.) <br>
HOSTESS: I really must insist you get back to your seats. <br>
SKY: No, don't just stand there telling us the rules. You're the
hostess. You're supposed to do something. <br>
(The Doctor knocks on the door four times. There is a long pause before
he gets the four thumps in reply.) <br>
SKY: What is it? What the hell's making that noise? She said she'd get
me. Stop it. Make it stop. Somebody make it stop. Don't just stand
there looking at me. It's not my fault. He started it with his stories.
<br>
(The hostess gets on the intercom.) <br>
DEE DEE: Calm down! <br>
SKY: And he made it worse! <br>
VAL: You're not helping. <br>
SKY: Why didn't you leave it alone? Stop staring at me. Just tell me
what the hell it is. <br>
DEE DEE: Calm down! <br>
(The thumping starts again.) <br>
SKY: It's coming for me. Oh, it's coming for me. It's coming for me.
It's coming for me. It's coming for me. <br>
(Sky backs up to the driver's door and screams.) <br>
DOCTOR: Get out of there! <br>
(Boom! The whole shuttle rocks from side to side and sparks fly. The
entertainment system comes back online as the lights go out.) <br>
BIFF: You all right? Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: Arms, legs, neck, head, nose. I'm fine. Everyone else? How are
we? <br>
(The pop singer on the screen behind the Doctor is replaced by an image
of Rose mouthing Doctor, Doctor, before it goes blank again.) <br>
DOCTOR: How are we? Everyone all right? <br>
HOBBES: Earthquake. Must be. <br>
DEE DEE: But that's impossible. The ground is fixed. It's solid. <br>
HOSTESS: We've got torches. Everyone take a torch. They're in the back
of the seats. <br>
VAL: Oh, Jethro. Sweetheart, come here. <br>
JETHRO: Never mind me. what about her? <br>
(Sky is sitting amongst the remains of the front row.) <br>
VAL: What happened to the seats? <br>
BIFF: Who did that? <br>
VAL: They've been ripped up. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's over.
We're still alive. Look, the wall's still intact. Do you see? <br>
(Intact but dented inwards.) <br>
HOSTESS: Joe? Claude? <br>
DOCTOR: We're safe. <br>
HOSTESS: Driver Joe, can you hear me? I'm not getting any response. The
intercom must be down. <br>
(The hostess opens the driver's door and bright light floods the cabin.
An alarm sounds until she manages to close it again.) <br>
VAL: What happened? What was that? <br>
BIFF: Is it the driver? Have we lost the driver? <br>
HOSTESS: The cabin's gone. <br>
HOBBES: Don't be ridiculous. It can't be gone. How can it be gone? <br>
DEE DEE: Well, well, you saw it. <br>
HOSTESS: There was nothing there, like it was ripped away. <br>
BIFF: What are you doing? <br>
(Biff aims his torchlight at the panel the Doctor is working on.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, that's better. Little bit of light. Thank you. Molto bene. <br>
VAL: Do you know what you're doing? <br>
BIFF: The cabin's gone. You'd better leave that wall alone. <br>
HOBBES: The cabin can't be gone. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's safe. Any rupture would automatically seal itself. <br>
(The Doctor removes the panel and looks at the wiring.) <br>
DOCTOR: But something sliced it off. You're right, the cabin's gone. <br>
HOSTESS: But if it gets separated? <br>
DOCTOR: It loses integrity. I'm sorry, they've been reduced to dust.
The driver and the mechanic. But they sent a distress signal. Help is
on its way. They saved our lives. We are going to get out of here, I
promise. We're still alive, and they are going to find us. <br>
JETHRO: Doctor, look at her. <br>
(Sky hasn't moved.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Yes. Sorry. Have we got a medical kit? <br>
JETHRO: Why won't she turn around? <br>
DOCTOR: What's her name? <br>
HOSTESS: Silvestry. Mrs Sky Silvestry. <br>
DOCTOR: Sky? Can you hear me? Are you all right? Can you move, Sky?
Just look at me. <br>
JETHRO: That noise from outside. It's stopped. <br>
VAL: Well, thank God for that. <br>
JETHRO: But what if it's not outside anymore? What if it's inside? <br>
VAL: Inside? Where? <br>
JETHRO: It was heading for her. <br>
DOCTOR: Sky? It's all right, Sky. I just want you to turn around, face
me. <br>
(Sky turns slowly and stares into the torchlight.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sky? <br>
SKY: Sky? <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right? <br>
SKY: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Are you hurt? <br>
SKY: Are you hurt? <br>
DOCTOR: You don't have to talk. <br>
SKY: You don't have to talk. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm trying to help. <br>
SKY: I'm trying to help. <br>
DOCTOR: My name's the Doctor. <br>
SKY: My name's the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, can you stop? <br>
SKY: Okay, can you stop? <br>
DOCTOR: I'd like you to stop. <br>
SKY: I'd like you to stop. <br>
HOBBES: Why's she doing that? <br>
SKY: Why's she doing that? <br>
BIFF: She's gone mad. <br>
SKY: She's gone mad. <br>
VAL: Stop it. <br>
SKY: Stop it. <br>
VAL: I said stop it. <br>
SKY: I said stop it. <br>
DEE DEE: I don't think she can. <br>
SKY: I don't think she can. <br>
HOBBES: All right now, stop it. This isn't funny. <br>
SKY: All right now, stop it. This isn't funny. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush, all of you. <br>
SKY: Shush, shush, shush, all of you. <br>
JETHRO: My name's Jethro. <br>
SKY: My name's Jethro. <br>
DOCTOR: Jethro, leave it. Just shut up. <br>
SKY: Jethro, leave it. Just shut up. <br>
DOCTOR: Why are you repeating? <br>
SKY: Why are you repeating? <br>
DOCTOR: What is that, learning? <br>
SKY: What is that, learning? <br>
DOCTOR: Copying? <br>
SKY: Copying? <br>
DOCTOR: Absorbing? <br>
SKY: Absorbing? <br>
DOCTOR: The square root of pi is 1.772453850905516027298167483341. Wow.
<br>
SKY: (overlapping) The square root of pi is
1.772453850905516027298167483341. Wow. <br>
HOBBES: But that's impossible. <br>
SKY: But that's impossible. <br>
DEE DEE: She couldn't repeat all that. <br>
SKY: She couldn't repeat all that. <br>
VAL: Tell her to stop. <br>
SKY: Tell her to stop. <br>
VAL: She's driving me mad. <br>
SKY: She's driving me mad. <br>
VAL: Just make her stop! <br>
SKY: Just make her stop! <br>
(People start talking over each other, with Sky still repeating their
words.) <br>
VAL: Stop her staring at me. Shut her up. <br>
SKY: Stop her staring at me. Shut her up. <br>
HOSTESS: It's got to be a trick. <br>
SKY: It's got to be a trick. <br>
DEE DEE: That's impossible. <br>
SKY: That's impossible. <br>
BIFF: I'm telling you, whatever your name is. <br>
SKY: I'm telling you, whatever your name is. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, just stop it, all of you. <br>
SKY: Now, just stop it all of you. <br>
HOBBES: Her eyes. What's wrong with her eyes? <br>
SKY: Her eyes. What's wrong with her eyes? <br>
JETHRO: She can copy anything. <br>
SKY: She can copy anything. <br>
VAL: Biff, don't just stand there, do something. Make her stop. <br>
SKY: Biff, don't just stand there, do something. Make her stop <br>
BIFF: You're scaring my wife. <br>
SKY: You're scaring my wife. <br>
HOSTESS: Mrs Silvestry. <br>
SKY: Mrs Silvestry. <br>
JETHRO: Six, six, six. <br>
SKY: Six, six, six. <br>
VAL: She's different. She's something else. Do something. Make her
stop. <br>
SKY: Make her stop. <br>
(The lights come back on, shutting everyone up.) <br>
HOSTESS: That's the back up system. <br>
BIFF: Well, that's a bit better. <br>
VAL: What about the rescue? How long's it going to take? <br>
HOSTESS: About sixty minutes, that's all. <br>
HOBBES: Then I suggest we all calm down. This panic isn't helping. That
poor woman is evidently in a state of <br>
HOBBES + SKY: Self induced hysteria. We should leave her alone. <br>
JETHRO: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I know. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: Doctor, now step back. I think you should leave her.
Alone. What's she doing? <br>
VAL + SKY: How can she do that? She's talking with you. And with me.
Oh, my God. Biff, what's she doing? <br>
JETHRO + SKY: She's repeating, at exactly the same time. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: That's impossible. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: There's not even a delay. <br>
JETHRO + SKY: Oh man, that is weird. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: I think you should all be very, very quiet. Have you got
that? <br>
VAL + SKY: How's she doing it? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Mrs Cane, please be quiet. <br>
VAL + SKY: How can she do that? She's got my voice! She's got my words!
<br>
BIFF + SKY: Come on, be quiet. Hush, now. Hush. She's doing it to me. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Just stop it, all of you. Stop it, please. Now then, Sky.
Are you Sky? Is Sky still in there? Mrs Silvestry? You know exactly
what I'm going to say. How are you doing that? Roast beef. Bananas. The
Medusa Cascade. Bang! Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, Tardis.
Shamble bobble dibble dooble. Oh, Doctor, you're so handsome. Yes, I
am, thank you. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. First she
repeats, then she catches up. What's the next stage? <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: Next stage of what? <br>
JETHRO + SKY: That's not her, is it. That's not Mrs Silvestry any more.
<br>
DOCTOR + SKY: I don't think so, no. I think the more we talk, the more
she learns. Now, I'm all for education, but in this case, maybe not.
Let's just move back. Come on. Come with me. Everyone, get back. All of
you, as far as you can. <br>
VAL + SKY: Doctor, make her stop. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Val, come with me. Come to the back. Stop looking at her.
Come on, Jethro. You too. Everyone, come on. Fifty minutes, that's all
we need. Fifty minutes till the rescue arrives. And she's not exactly
strong. Look at her. All she's got is our voices. <br>
VAL + SKY: I can't, I can't look at her. It's those eyes. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: We must not look at goblin men. <br>
BIFF + SKY: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: It's a poem. Christina Rossetti. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: We must not look at goblin men. We must not buy their
fruits. Who knows upon what soil they fed Their hungry, thirsty roots? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Actually, I don't think that's helping. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: She's not a goblin, or a monster. She's just a very sick
woman. <br>
JETHRO + SKY: Maybe that's why it went for her. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: There is no it. <br>
JETHRO + SKY: Think about it though. That knocking went all the way
round the bus until it found her. And she was the most scared out of
all of us. Maybe that's what it needed. That's how it got in. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: For the last time. Nothing can live on the surface of
Midnight. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Professor, I'm glad you've got an absolute definition of
life in the universe, but perhaps the universe has got ideas of its
own, hmm? Now trust me, I've got previous. I think there might well be
some consciousness inside Mrs Silvestry, but maybe she's still in
there. And it's our job to help her. <br>
BIFF + SKY: Well, you can help her. I'm not going near. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: No, I've got to stay back, because if she's copying us,
then maybe the final stage is becoming us. I don't want her becoming
me, or things could get a whole lot worse. <br>
VAL + SKY: Oh, like you're so special. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: As it happens, yes, I am. So that's decided. We stay
back, and we wait. When the rescue ship comes, we can get her to
hospital. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: We should throw her out. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: I beg your pardon? <br>
VAL + SKY: Can we do that? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Don't be ridiculous. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: That thing, whatever it is, killed the driver, and the
mechanic, and I don't think she's finished yet. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: She can't even move. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: Look at her. Look at her eyes. She killed Joe, and she
killed Claude, and we're next. <br>
BIFF + SKY: She's still doing it. Just stop it. Stop talking. Stop it! <br>
VAL + SKY: Biff, don't, sweetheart. <br>
BIFF + SKY: But she won't stop. We can't throw her out, though. We
can't even open the doors. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: No one is getting thrown out. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: Yes, we can. Because there's an air pressure seal. Like
when you opened the cabin door, you weren't pulled out. You had a
couple of seconds, because it takes the pressure wall about six seconds
to collapse. Well, six seconds exactly. That's enough time to throw
someone out. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Thanks, Dee Dee. Just what we needed. <br>
VAL: Would it kill her outside? <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: I don't know. But she's got a body now. It would
certainly kill the physical form. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: No one is killing anyone. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: I wouldn't risk the cabin door twice, but we've got that
one. All we need to do is grab hold of her and throw her out. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Now, listen, all of you. For all we know that's a brand
new life form over there. And if it's come inside to discover us, than
what's it found? This little bunch of humans. What do you amount to,
murder? Because this is where you decide. You decide who you are. Could
you actually murder her? Any of you? Really? Or are you better than
that? <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: I'd do it. <br>
BIFF + SKY: So would I. <br>
VAL + SKY: And me. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: I think we should. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: What? <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: I want her out. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: You can't say that. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: I'm sorry, but you said it yourself, Doctor. She is
growing in strength. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: That's not what I said. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: I want to go home. I'm sorry. I want to be safe. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: You'll be safe any minute now. The rescue truck is on its
way. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: But what happens then, Doctor? If it takes that thing
back to the Leisure Palace, if that thing reaches civilisation. What if
it spreads? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: No, because when we get back to the base, I'll be there
to contain it. <br>
VAL + SKY: You haven't done much so far. <br>
BIFF + SKY: You're just standing in the back with the rest of us. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: She's dangerous. It's my job to see that this vessel is
safe, and we should get rid of her. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: Now, hang on. I think perhaps we're all going a little
bit too far. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: At last. Thank you. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: Two people are dead. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Don't make it a third. Jethro, what do you say? <br>
JETHRO + SKY: I'm not killing anyone. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Thank you. <br>
VAL + SKY: He's just a boy. <br>
JETHRO + SKY: What, so I don't get a vote? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: There isn't a vote. It's not happening. Ever. If you try
to throw her out that door, you'll have to get past me first. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: Okay. <br>
BIFF + SKY: Fine by me. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Oh, now you're being stupid. Just think about it. Could
you actually take hold of someone and throw them out of that door? <br>
BIFF + SKY: Calling me a coward? <br>
VAL + SKY: Who put you in charge, anyway? <br>
HOBBES + SKY: I'm sorry, but you're a Doctor of what, exactly? <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: He wasn't even booked in. The rest of you, tickets in
advance. He just turned up out of the blue. <br>
VAL + SKY: Where from? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: I'm just travelling. I'm a traveller, that's all. <br>
VAL + SKY: Like an immigrant? <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: Who were you talking to? Before you got on board, you
were talking to someone. Who was that? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Just Donna. Just my friend. <br>
BIFF + SKY: And what were you saying to her? <br>
VAL + SKY: He hasn't even told us his name. <br>
JETHRO + SKY: The thing is though, Doctor, you've been loving this. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Oh, Jethro, not you. <br>
JETHRO + SKY: No, but ever since all the trouble started, you've been
loving it. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: It has to be said, you do seem to have a certain glee. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: All right, I'm interested. Yes, I can't help it. Because
whatever's inside her, it's brand new, and that's fascinating. <br>
VAL + SKY: What, you wanted this to happen? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: No. <br>
BIFF + SKY: And you were talking to her, all on your own, before all
the trouble. Right at the front, you were talking to that Sky woman,
the two of you together. I saw you. <br>
VAL + SKY: We all did. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: And you went into the cabin. <br>
BIFF + SKY: What were you saying to her? <br>
DOCTOR: I was just talking. <br>
BIFF + SKY: Saying what? <br>
JETHRO + SKY: You called us humans like you're not one of us. <br>
VAL + SKY: He did. That's what he said. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: And the wiring. He went into that panel and opened up
the wiring. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: That was after. <br>
BIFF + SKY: But how did you know what to do? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Because I'm clever! <br>
HOBBES + SKY: I see. Well, that makes things clear. <br>
BIFF + SKY: And what are we, then? Idiots? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: That's not what I meant. <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: If you're clever, then what are we? <br>
VAL + SKY: You've been looking down on us from the moment we walked in.
<br>
HOSTESS + SKY: Even if he goes, he's practically volunteered. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Oh come on, just listen to yourself, please. <br>
BIFF + SKY: Do you mean we throw him out as well? <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: If we have to. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Look, just. Right, sorry, yes, hold on, just. I know
you're scared, and so am I. Look at me, I am. But we have all got to
calm down and cool off and think. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: Perhaps you could tell us your name. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: What does it matter? <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: Then tell us. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: John Smith. <br>
HOBBES + SKY: Your real name. <br>
BIFF + SKY: He's lying. Look at his face. <br>
VAL + SKY: His eyes are the same as hers. <br>
JETHRO + SKY: Why won't you tell us? <br>
DEE DEE + SKY: It's a simple enough question. <br>
VAL + SKY: He's been lying to us right from the start. <br>
HOSTESS + SKY: What's your name? <br>
BIFF + SKY: No one's called John Smith. Come off it. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Now listen to me. Listen to me right now, because you
need me, all of you. If we are going to get out of this, then you need
me. <br>
HOBBES: So you keep saying. You've been repeating yourself more than
her. <br>
VAL: If anyone's in charge, it should be the Professor. He's the
expert. <br>
JETHRO: Mum, stop. Just look. <br>
BIFF: You keep out of this, Jethro. <br>
JETHRO: Look at her! <br>
DEE DEE: She's stopped. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: When did she? No, she hasn't. She's still doing it. <br>
VAL: She looks the same to me. No, she's stopped. Look, I'm talking,
and she's not. <br>
BIFF: What about me, is she? Look. Look at that. She's not doing me.
She's let me go. <br>
HOSTESS: Mrs Silvestry? Nor me. Nothing. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Sky, what are you doing? <br>
DEE DEE: She's still doing him. <br>
HOBBES: Doctor, it's you. She's only copying you. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Why me? Why are you doing this? <br>
DEE DEE: She won't leave him alone. <br>
VAL: Do you see? I said so. She's with him. <br>
BIFF: They're together. <br>
HOBBES: How do you explain it, Doctor, if you're so clever? <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: I don't know. Sky, stop it. I said stop it. Just stop it.
<br>
VAL: Look at the two of them. <br>
DOCTOR + SKY: Mrs Silvestry, I'm trying to understand. You've captured
my speech. What for? What do you need? You need my voice in particular.
The cleverest voice in the room. Why? Because I'm the only one who can
help? Oh, I'd love that to be true, but your eyes, they're saying
something else. Listen to me. Whatever you want, if it's life, or form,
or consciousness, or voice, you don't have to steal it. You can find it
without hurting anyone. And I'll help you. That's a promise. So, what
do you think? <br>
SKY: Do we have a deal? <br>
DOCTOR: Do we have a deal? <br>
DEE DEE: Hold on, did she? <br>
JETHRO: She spoke first. <br>
VAL: She can't have. <br>
HOBBES: She did. <br>
JETHRO: She spoke first. <br>
SKY: Oh, look at that. I'm ahead of you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, look at that. I'm ahead of you. <br>
HOBBES: Did you see? She spoke before he did. Definitely. <br>
JETHRO: He's copying her. <br>
HOBBES: Doctor, what's happening? <br>
SKY: I think it's moved. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's moved. <br>
SKY: I think it's letting me go. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's letting me go. <br>
DEE DEE: What do you mean? Letting you go from what? <br>
BIFF: But he's repeating now. He's the one doing it. It's him. <br>
JETHRO: They're separating. <br>
HOBBES: Mrs Silvestry, is that you? <br>
SKY: Yes. Yes, it's me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it's me. <br>
SKY: I'm coming back. Listen. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm coming back <br>
SKY: It's me. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. It's me. <br>
JETHRO: Like it's passed into the Doctor. It's transferred. Whatever it
is, it's gone inside him. <br>
DEE DEE: No, that's not what happened. <br>
VAL: But look at her. <br>
SKY: Look at me, I can move. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at me. <br>
SKY: I can feel again. <br>
DOCTOR: I can move. I can feel again. <br>
SKY: I'm coming back to life. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm coming back to life. <br>
SKY: And look at him. He can't move. <br>
DOCTOR: And look at him. He can't move. <br>
SKY: Help me. <br>
DOCTOR: Help me. <br>
SKY: Professor? <br>
DOCTOR: Professor? <br>
SKY: Get me away from him. <br>
DOCTOR: Get me away from him. <br>
SKY: Please. <br>
DOCTOR: Please. <br>
(Hobbes takes Sky's hands and helps her up.) <br>
SKY: Oh, thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. <br>
JETHRO: They've completely separated. <br>
BIFF: It's in him. Do you see? I said it was him all the time. <br>
VAL: She's free. She's been saved. <br>
SKY: Oh, it was so cold. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it was so cold. <br>
SKY: I couldn't breathe. <br>
DOCTOR: I couldn't breathe. <br>
SKY: I'm sorry. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. <br>
SKY: I must have scared you so much. <br>
DOCTOR: I must have scared you so much. <br>
VAL: No, no, it's all right. I've got you. Ooo, there you are, my love.
It's gone. Everything's all right now. <br>
DEE DEE: I wouldn't touch her. <br>
BIFF: But it's gone. She's clean. It passed into him. <br>
DEE DEE: That's not what happened. <br>
HOBBES: Thank you for your opinion, Dee, but clearly Mrs Silvestry has
been released. <br>
DEE DEE: No. <br>
VAL: Just leave her alone. She's safe, isn't she? Jethro, it's let her
go, hasn't it? <br>
JETHRO: I think so, yeah. Looks like it. Professor? <br>
HOBBES: I'd say, from observation, the Doctor can't move. And when she
was possessed, she couldn't move, so <br>
BIFF: Well, there we are then. Now the only problem we've got is this
Doctor. <br>
SKY: It's inside his head. <br>
DOCTOR: It's inside his head. <br>
SKY: It killed the driver. <br>
DOCTOR: It killed the driver. <br>
SKY: And the mechanic. <br>
DOCTOR: And the mechanic. <br>
SKY: And now it wants us. <br>
DOCTOR: And now it wants us. <br>
VAL: I said so. <br>
SKY: He's waited so long. <br>
DOCTOR: He's waited so long. <br>
SKY: In the dark. <br>
DOCTOR: In the dark. <br>
SKY: And the cold. <br>
DOCTOR: And the cold. <br>
SKY: And the diamonds. <br>
DOCTOR: And the diamonds. <br>
SKY: Until you came. <br>
DOCTOR: Until you came. <br>
SKY: Bodies so hot. <br>
DOCTOR: Bodies so hot. <br>
SKY: With blood. <br>
DOCTOR: With blood. <br>
SKY: And pain. <br>
DOCTOR: And pain. <br>
VAL: Stop. Oh, my God, make him stop. Someone make him stop. <br>
DEE DEE: But she's saying it. <br>
VAL: And you can shut up. <br>
DEE DEE: But it's not him, it's her. He's just repeating. <br>
BIFF: But that's what the thing does, it repeats. <br>
HOSTESS: Just let her talk. <br>
BIFF: What do you know? Fat lot of good you've been. <br>
HOSTESS: Just let her explain. <br>
DEE DEE: I think. I mean, from what I've seen, it repeats, then it
synchronises, then it goes on to the next stage and that's exactly what
the Doctor said would happen. <br>
BIFF: What, and you're on his side? <br>
DEE DEE: No. <br>
JETHRO: The voice is the thing. <br>
DEE DEE: And she's the voice. She stole it. Look at her. It's not
possessing him, it's draining him. <br>
HOSTESS: She's got his voice. <br>
VAL: But that's not true, because it can't. Because I saw it pass into
him. I saw it with my own eyes. <br>
BIFF: So did I. <br>
DEE DEE: You didn't. <br>
VAL: It went from her, to him. You saw it, didn't you? <br>
JETHRO: I don't know. <br>
VAL: Oh, don't be stupid, Jethro. Of course you did. <br>
JETHRO: I suppose he was right next to her. <br>
BIFF: Everyone saw it. Everyone. <br>
DEE DEE: You didn't. You're just making it up. I know what I saw, and I
saw her stealing his voice. <br>
VAL: She's as bad as him. Someone shut her up. <br>
HOBBES: I think you should be quiet, Dee. <br>
DEE DEE: Well, I'm only saying <br>
HOBBES: And that's an order! You're making a fool of yourself,
pretending you're an expert in mechanics and hydraulics, when I can
tell you, you are nothing more than average at best. Now shut up. <br>
SKY: That's how he does it. <br>
DOCTOR: That's how he does it. <br>
SKY: He makes you fight. <br>
DOCTOR: He makes you fight. <br>
SKY: Creeps into your head. <br>
DOCTOR: Creeps into your head. <br>
SKY: And whispers. <br>
DOCTOR: And whispers. <br>
SKY: Listen. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. <br>
SKY: Just listen. <br>
DOCTOR: Just listen. <br>
SKY: That's him. <br>
DOCTOR: That's him. <br>
SKY: Inside. <br>
DOCTOR: Inside. <br>
BIFF: Throw him out. <br>
VAL: Get him out of my head. <br>
BIFF: Yeah, we should throw him out. <br>
VAL: Don't just talk about it, just. You're useless. Do something. <br>
BIFF: I will. You watch me. I'm going to throw him out. <br>
SKY: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SKY: Throw him out. <br>
DOCTOR: Throw him out. <br>
SKY: Get rid of him. <br>
DOCTOR: Get rid of him. <br>
SKY: Now. <br>
DOCTOR: Now. <br>
(Biff takes hold of the Doctor from behind.) <br>
DEE DEE: Don't! <br>
VAL: It'll be you next. <br>
HOSTESS: Don't think we should do this. <br>
BIFF: It was your idea. Professor, help me. <br>
HOBBES: I can't. I'm not. <br>
BIFF: What sort of a man are you? Come on. <br>
VAL: Throw him out. <br>
BIFF: Come on. <br>
VAL: Just do it. Throw him out. <br>
BIFF: Help. Professor, help me. <br>
(The Doctor manages to hook his foot onto a seat.) <br>
VAL: Get him out. <br>
BIFF: Grab hold of him. Not like that. Are you stupid? <br>
SKY: Cast him out. <br>
DOCTOR: Cast him out. <br>
SKY: Into the sun. <br>
DOCTOR: Into the sun. <br>
VAL: I want him out. <br>
SKY: And the night. <br>
DOCTOR: And the night. <br>
VAL: Get him out. <br>
BIFF: Come on. Don't just stand there. Do something. <br>
VAL: Get him out. <br>

(The hostess grabs Sky and rushes her towards the entrance door. She
presses the button and everyone screams as the bright light floods in.)
<br>
HOSTESS: One, two, three, four, five, six. <br>
(The pressure wall collapses. The hostess and Sky are sucked out and
the door closes. The men drop the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's gone. It's gone. It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's
gone. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone, it's gone, it's gone. It's gone,
it's gone, it's gone. <br>

DONNA: Do you think it's still out there? (silence) Well, you'd better
tell them. This lot. <br>
