WOMAN [OC]: Solar flare activity has increased across space lanes five,
five, six and all commercial flights are advised to avoid<br>
(The Tardis materialises, and the Doctor and Rose step out.) <br>
DOCTOR: So, it's two hundred thousand, and it's a spaceship. No, wait a
minute, space station, and er, go and try that gate over there. Off you
go. <br>
ROSE: Two hundred thousand? <br>
DOCTOR: Two hundred thousand. <br>
ROSE: Right. <br>
(Rose opens the Tardis door.) <br>
ROSE: Adam? Out you come. <br>
(Adam comes out, and his jaw drops.) <br>
ADAM: Oh, my God. <br>
ROSE: Don't worry, you'll get used to it. <br>
ADAM: Where are we? <br>
ROSE: Good question. Let's see. So, er, judging by the architecture,
I'd say we're around the year two hundred thousand. If you listen <br>
ADAM: Yeah. <br>
ROSE: Engines. We're on some sort of space station. Yeah, definitely a
space station. It's a bit warm in here. They could turn the heating
down. Tell you what - let's try that gate. Come on! <br>
(Rose leads the men through the metal gate to a massive viewing
window.) <br>
ROSE: Here we go! And this is. I'll let the Doctor describe it. <br>
DOCTOR: The Fourth great and bountiful Human Empire. And there it is,
planet Earth at it's height. Covered with mega-cities, five moons,
population ninety six billion. The hub of a galactic domain stretching
across a million planets, a million species, with mankind right in the
middle. <br>
(Adam faints.) <br>
DOCTOR: He's your boyfriend. <br>
ROSE: Not anymore.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The space station has a central hub with three
wheels turning.)&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Adam. Open your mind. You're going to like this.
Fantastic period of history. The human race at its most intelligent.
Culture, art, politics. This era has got fine food, good manners. <br>
MAN: Out of the way! <br>
(Suddenly there are a lot of people bustling around, opening up food
vending stations and serving customers at their counters.) <br>
CHEF: Thank you very much indeed. Somebody there? That's great. What do
you want, love? All right, keep moving. I'll be with you lot in a
minute. Here you are. One at a time. What now, what was it? Kronkburger
with cheese, kronkburger with pajatos. Do you want a drink? Oi, you,
mate. Stop pushing. Get back. I said, back. <br>
ROSE: Fine cuisine? <br>
DOCTOR: My watch must be wrong. No, it's fine. It's weird. <br>
ROSE: That's what comes of showing off. Your history's not as good as
you thought it was. <br>
DOCTOR: My history's perfect. <br>
ROSE: Well, obviously not. <br>
ADAM: They're all human. What about the millions of planets, the
millions of species? Where are they? <br>
DOCTOR: Good question. Actually, that is a good question. Adam, me old
mate, you must be starving. <br>
ADAM: No, I'm just a bit time sick. <br>
DOCTOR: No, you just need a bit of grub. Oi, mate - how much is a
kronkburger? <br>
CHEF: Two credits twenty, sweetheart. Now join the queue. <br>
DOCTOR: Money. We need money. Let's use a cashpoint. <br>
TANNOY: Attention all staff. All coverage of the Glasgow water riots
being transferred five through nine. <br>
(The Doctor goes to a Credit Five cashpoint and does something clever
with his sonic screwdriver. It produces a plastic card which the Doctor
hands to Adam.) <br>
DOCTOR: There you go, pocket money. Don't spend it all on sweets. <br>
ADAM: How does it work? <br>
DOCTOR: Go and find out. Stop nagging me. The thing is, Adam, time
travel's like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guide book,
you've got to throw yourself in. Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get
charged double and end up kissing complete strangers. Or is that just
me? Stop asking questions, go and do it. Off you go, then. Your first
date. <br>
ROSE: You're going to get a smack, you are. <br>
(Rose and Adam leave the Doctor, who approaches a pair of smartly
dressed young women.) <br>
DOCTOR: Er, this is going to sound daft, but can you tell me where I
am? <br>
CATHICA: Floor One Three Nine. Could they write it any bigger? <br>
DOCTOR: Floor one three nine of what? <br>
CATHICA: Must've been a hell of a party. <br>
SUKI: You're on Satellite Five. <br>
DOCTOR: What's Satellite Five. <br>
CATHICA: Come on, how could you get on board without knowing where you
are? <br>
DOCTOR: Look at me. I'm stupid. <br>
SUKI: Hold on, wait a minute. Are you a test? Some sort of management
test kind of thing? <br>
DOCTOR: You've got me. Well done. You're too clever for me. <br>
(The Doctor holds up his psychic paper ID card.) <br>
SUKI: We were warned about this in basic training. All workers have to
be versed in company promotion. <br>
CATHICA: Right, fire away, ask your questions. If it gets me to Floor
five hundred I'll do anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Why, what happens on Floor five hundred? <br>
CATHICA: The walls are made of gold. And you should know, Mister
Management. So, this is what we do. <br>
(She goes over to a wall monitor.) <br>
CATHICA: Latest news, sandstorms on the new Venus archipelago. Two
hundred dead. Glasgow water riots into their third day. Space lane
seventy seven closed by sunspot activity. And over on the Bad Wolf
channel, the Face of Bo has just announced he's pregnant. <br>
DOCTOR: I get it. You broadcast the news. <br>
CATHICA: We are the news. We're the journalists. We write it, package
it and sell it. Six hundred channels

my name is Cathica Santini Khadeni. That's Cathica with a C, in case
you want to write to Floor five hundred praising me, and please do.
Now, please feel free to ask any questions. The process of news
gathering must be open, honest, and beyond bias. That's company policy.

CATHICA: And engage safety <br>
(The seven hold their hands over palm print on the table in front of
them. Lights start to come on around the room. Cathica clicks her
fingers and a portal opens in her forehead. The seven put their hands
into the palm prints.) <br>
CATHICA: And three, two, and spike. <br>
(A beam of light shines into her portal.) <br>
DOCTOR: Compressed information, streaming into her. Reports from every
city, every country, every planet, and they all get packaged inside her
head. She becomes part of the software. Her brain is the computer. <br>
ROSE: If it all goes through her, she must be a genius. <br>
DOCTOR: Nah, she wouldn't remember any of it. There's too much. Her
head'd blow up. The brain's the processor. As soon as it closes, she
forgets. <br>
ROSE: So, what about all these people round the edge? <br>
DOCTOR: They've all got tiny little chips in their head, connecting
them to her and they transmit six hundred channels. Every single fact
in the Empire beams out of this place. Now that's what I call power. </font></p>

all the threats. <br>
DOCTOR: What threats? <br>
CATHICA: I don't know all of them. Usual stuff. And the price of space
warp doubled so that kept the visitors away. Oh, and the government on
Chavic Five's collapsed, so that lot stopped coming, you see. Just lots
of little reasons, that's all. <br>

Five would have seen it. We see everything. <br>

technology. <br>

DOCTOR: It's backwards. There's a great big door in your head. You
should've chucked this out years ago. <br>

EDITOR: I started without you. This is fascinating. Satellite Five
contains every piece of information within the Fourth Great and
Bountiful Human Empire. Birth certificates, shopping habits, bank
statements, but you two, you don't exist. Not a trace. No birth, no
job, not the slightest kiss. How can you walk through the world and not
leave a single footprint? <br>

information back, because apparently, you're no one. It's so rare not
to know something. Who are you? <br>

on. <br>
(Suki grabs Rose's arm. Two other zombies grab the Doctor.) <br>

DOCTOR: Since that information's keeping us alive, I'm hardly going to
say, am I. <br>
EDITOR: Well, perhaps my Editor in Chief can convince you otherwise. <br>
DOCTOR: And who's that? <br>
EDITOR: It may interest you to know that this is not the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire. In fact, it's not actually human at all.
It's merely a place where humans happen to live. <br>

EDITOR: Yeah. Yeah, sorry. It's a place where humans are allowed to
live by kind permission of my client. <br>

very nasty set of teeth in a mouth on the end of a pseudopod.) <br>
ROSE: What is that? <br>
DOCTOR: You mean that thing's in charge of Satellite Five? <br>
EDITOR: That thing, as you put it, is in charge of the human race. For
almost a hundred years, mankind has been shaped and guided, his
knowledge and ambition strictly controlled by it's broadcast news,
edited by my superior, your master, and humanity's guiding light, the
mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe. I call him Max. <br>
(Down on Floor 139 Adam avoids Cathica as she goes to take another look
at the schematic that the Doctor called up. Then she goes to the lift
and punches in the code for Floor 500. <br>
Meanwhile, the Doctor and Rose have been placed in hefty sets of
manacles.) <br>
EDITOR: Create a climate of fear and it's easy to keep the borders
closed. It's just a matter of emphasis. The right word in the right
broadcast repeated often enough can destabilise an economy, invent an
enemy, change a vote. <br>
ROSE: So all the people on Earth are like, slaves. <br>
EDITOR: Well, now, there's an interesting point. Is a slave a slave if
he doesn't know he's enslaved? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
EDITOR: Oh. I was hoping for a philosophical debate. Is that all I'm
going to get? Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
EDITOR: You're no fun. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me out of these manacles. You'll find out how much fun I
am. <br>
EDITOR: Oh, he's tough, isn't he. But, come on. Isn't it a great
system? You've got to admire it, just a little bit. <br>
ROSE: You can't hide something on this scale. Somebody must have
noticed. <br>
EDITOR: From time to time, someone, yes, but the computer chip system
allows me to see inside their brains. I can see the smallest doubt and
crush it. <br>
(Cathica arrives on Floor 500. Adam goes to the broadcast room on 139.)
<br>
EDITOR: Then they just carry on, living the life, strutting about
downstairs and all over the surface of the Earth like they're so
individual, when of course, they're not. They're just cattle. In that
respect, the Jagrafess hasn't changed a thing. <br>
(The Doctor and Rose spot Cathica behind the Editor's back.) <br>
ROSE: What about you? You're not a Jagrabelly <br>
DOCTOR: Jagrafess. <br>
ROSE: Jagrafess. You're not a Jagrafess. You're human. <br>
EDITOR: Yeah, well, simply being human doesn't pay very well. <br>
ROSE: But you couldn't have done this all on your own. <br>
EDITOR: No. I represent a consortium of banks. Money prefers a
long-term investment. Also, the Jagrafess needed a little hand to
install himself. <br>
DOCTOR: No wonder, a creature that size. What's his life span? <br>
EDITOR: Three thousand years. <br>
DOCTOR: That's one hell of a metabolism generating all that heat.
That's why Satellite Five's so hot. You pump it out of the creature,
channel it downstairs. Jagrafess stays cool, it stays alive. Satellite
Five is one great big life support system. </font></p>
