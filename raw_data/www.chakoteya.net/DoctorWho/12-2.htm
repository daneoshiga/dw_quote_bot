<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A wheel and spoke design space station hangs in
orbit above Earth. It has a space shuttle sitting next to the spoke. We
go inside and see it through the green-tinted sight of something that
probably shouldn't be there. There appear to be people encased in
plastic pods. The lid of a pod opens to reveal a young man dressed in
white, then we leave.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises inside a dark room. The
Doctor emerges carrying a torch.) <br>
DOCTOR: You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot. <br>
HARRY [OC]: I said I was sorry, didn't I? <br>
DOCTOR: What? Come out! (thud) And don't touch anything. <br>
HARRY [OC]: I'm only trying to open the door. <br>
(Harry comes out of the Tardis.) <br>
HARRY: Oh, I say. We've gone! <br>
SARAH: Who's gone? <br>
(Sarah comes out of the Tardis carrying an oil lamp.) <br>
HARRY: I mean, this isn't. We aren't where we were when. I've gone mad.
<br>
SARAH: That's how I felt the first time. Where are we, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I've no idea. <br>
SARAH: A little trip to the moon, you said, just to prove to Harry <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't expect him to start messing about with the helmic
regulator. Come away from there, Harry. <br>
HARRY: You could sell that thing, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I could what? <br>
HARRY: Jolly useful in Trafalgar Square. I mean, hundreds of bobbies
hiding inside it. <br>
SARAH: Harry. <br>
HARRY: Eh? <br>
SARAH: Stop burbling. <br>
HARRY: What? Oh, sorry. Shock, I suppose. I must say, I feel very
strange. <br>
DOCTOR: Not much oxygen. Still, nothing to worry about. <br>
SARAH: Suffocation is nothing to worry about? <br>
DOCTOR: We can survive for quite a time yet. <br>
SARAH: While you play with that yo-yo? <br>
DOCTOR: Just a simply gravity reading, Sarah. Yes, almost certainly
we're in some kind of artificial satellite. Now isn't that interesting?
<br>
SARAH: Not very. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it is. <br>
SARAH: It's dark, it's cold and it's getting very airless. <br>
DOCTOR: All we have to do is get the power back on. Let's see what's
over here. <br>
SARAH: Might as well go for a look round, I suppose. Are you
coming?&nbsp;<br>
HARRY: We'd better stick with the Doctor, don't you think? <br>
(The Doctor finds the light switch. The decor is futuristic white with
some control panels in the wall and a couple of desks and chairs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! That's better. Incredible. <br>
(Sarah blows out her lamp.) <br>
HARRY: I say. What's all that for? <br>
DOCTOR: I've never seen anything quite like it. <br>
(A door slides open next to Sarah.) <br>
SARAH: Hey, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Definitely build on Earth, but I can't quite place the period. <br>
(The next room contains even more equipment.) <br>
SARAH [OC]: Doctor, look! <br>
DOCTOR: In a minute, Sarah! <br>
SARAH [OC]: But <br>
HARRY: None of it seems to work now, anyway. <br>
(Sarah enters the new room, which contains a couch on a slight incline,
and examines a large console sticking out of the wall. She does not
notice that the door has silently closed behind her.) <br>
DOCTOR: Judging by the macro-slave drive and that modified version of
the Bennett oscillator, I'd say this was built in the early thirtieth
Century? <br>
HARRY: (gasping) Oh, no. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't agree? <br>
HARRY: Early thirtieth century? <br>
DOCTOR: Late twenty ninth, early thirtieth, I feel sure. </font></p>

difficult. Then she discovers the closed door.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! Doctor! There's hardly any air in here! Doctor, please! <br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There is no sound of Sarah's thumping in here.) <br>
HARRY: Doctor, I'm a simple sort of chap. Are you trying to tell me
we're now in the middle of the thirtieth century? <br>
DOCTOR: Good heavens, no. Well beyond that. <br>
HARRY: Beyond the thirtieth? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you gave that helmic regulator quite a twist, I'm afraid.
<br>
HARRY: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say. All this stuff's obviously been here for
some time. Several thousand years at least. What was that?
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Sarah? Where's she got to? <br>
HARRY: In the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Impossible, I've got the key. I've told her time an again about
going off by herself. Sarah? <br>
HARRY: Well, there's only one door and she. I swear she didn't go out
that way. <br>
DOCTOR: There must be another exit, then. <br>
HARRY: A sort of hidden deck hatch or something? <br>
DOCTOR: Vacuum-tight panel, more likely. They used them a lot in these
early space vessels. Ah. Just as I thought. <br>
HARRY: No doorknob. <br>
DOCTOR: There must be a remote control. You haven't touched anything
have you, Harry? <br>
HARRY: Me? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there are only two of us here and your name is Harry. <br>
HARRY: Oh, yeah. I did just touch one switch. <br>
DOCTOR: Which switch, Harry? <br>
HARRY: Nothing happened. <br>
DOCTOR: Which switch? <br>
HARRY: Which switch? Well, I think it was. Well, no, no, perhaps it
was. I may have been standing <br>
DOCTOR: Try to remember, Harry. <br>
HARRY: I am trying! It's awfully difficult. I can hardly breathe. <br>
DOCTOR: Think where you were standing. <br>
HARRY: Er, it was this one. <br>
DOCTOR: Sure? <br>
HARRY: But nothing happened. <br>
DOCTOR: Go on, press it. <br>
(The door opens.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Control room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Sarah has passed out.) <br>
HARRY: Crikey, she's cyanosed. <br>
DOCTOR: No air in here. Help me to get her back. <br>
HARRY: Quick. <br>
(But the door closes as they pick up Sarah.) <br>
HARRY: Now what'll we do? <br>
DOCTOR: There must be a reverse mechanism. <br>
HARRY: I've always hated sliding doors, ever since I caught my nose in
one in Pompey Barracks. <br>
DOCTOR: How is she, Harry? <br>
HARRY: She'll be okay if we can get her out of here. <br>
(The Doctor tries various switches on the big console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Must be a broken circuit. <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. Nothing's working properly here. <br>
HARRY: Oh? <br>
DOCTOR: I've found the oxygen supply. <br>
HARRY: Well done. <br>
(The Doctor turns a knob underneath a nozzle high in the wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: No good, Harry. <br>
HARRY: No luck, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Why is nothing functioning here? <br>
HARRY: Couldn't we smash our way out or something? <br>
DOCTOR: What, with our bare hands? <br>
HARRY: It's all my fault. <br>
DOCTOR: I got us into this, Harry. <br>
HARRY: I haven't got enough puff to argue with you. <br>
DOCTOR: Then lie down and conserve the oxygen, while I do what I can.
That's odd. <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: These cables have been sheared clean through. Oxygen valve
servo-mechanism. Yellow, black, green. <br>
(He traces the cables back to the control panel.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yellow, black, green. Yellow, black, green. <br>
(He returns to the severed cables in the wall panel and uses his sonic
screwdriver. The lack of oxygen starts to get to the Doctor, too, and
he drops it. Finally he succeeds in getting fresh air rushing in.) <br>
DOCTOR: Harry. Harry? <br>
HARRY: Is she, she okay? <br>
DOCTOR: Just in time. Are you feeling better? <br>
HARRY: Convalescent. All I need now is a couple of weeks at the
seaside. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Give me a hand to lay her on that couch. It's nearer the
vents. <br>
HARRY: Good thinking. <br>
(They lay Sarah on the sloping couch and the Doctor opens up more
nozzles.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'll just repair some of those cables. <br>
HARRY: Sheared, you said. <br>
DOCTOR: Or bitten. <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a mystery here, Harry. Something happened a long time
ago. <br>
HARRY: Bitten? <br>
DOCTOR: It looks like it. The interesting question is why? Clearly
deliberate, therefore done for a purpose. Therefore, whatever it was
had a reasoning intelligence. <br>
HARRY: And very large teeth. <br>
DOCTOR: Splendid! Now let's see if that panel works. <br>
(The Doctor goes to the large console and presses a button. The door to
the control room slides open.) <br>
DOCTOR: All systems go, wouldn't you say? <br>
HARRY: She's coming round. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
HARRY: Steady. Steady on, old girl. Steady on. <br>
SARAH: Harry <br>
HARRY: Yes, I'm here, I'm here. <br>
SARAH: Call me old girl again and I'll spit in your eye. <br>
DOCTOR: Welcome back, Sarah Jane. <br>
SARAH: Couldn't breathe <br>
HARRY: A drop of brandy'd be the thing now. <br>
DOCTOR: There's some in the Tardis. <br>
HARRY: You'll be as right as ninepence in a minute. We're going to get
you some brandy, all right? <br>
SARAH: Ugh, I hate brandy. <br>
HARRY: Doctor, do you think you could possibly persuade her to take
some?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A saucer-like infra red light fitting comes down
from the ceiling.) <br>
HARRY: I say, what's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Get down, Harry? <br>
(The Doctor pushes Harry down behind a desk. Harry leaves a shoe behind
which gets zapped by the light.) <br>
HARRY: Crikey. What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Keep your head down.

aerial. It gets zapped.) <br>
DOCTOR: We seem to be trapped, Harry. <br>
HARRY: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Some sort of automatic guard. I hadn't bargained on this when I
repaired the circuits. I wonder. Of course! That's why they were cut in
the first place. <br>
HARRY: What about Sarah? If she comes out <br>
DOCTOR: Tell her to stay where she is. <br>

is playing. She is lying in an alcove above a large console.) <br>
SARAH: Where am I? <br>
MAN [OC]: Welcome, sister. Welcome to Nerva. No, do not move. It is
dangerous to move from the tranquiller couch. Please remain in contact
with the biocryonic vibrations. In five minutes, the final phase of
your processing must commence. If you have any personal possessions
that you wish to have preserved, please place them in the casket
adjacent to your right hand. Shortly you will hear the recorded voice
of the High Minister speaking personally to you. At the conclusion of
the Minister's message, there will be a two minute interregnum
preceding the commencement of irradiation. </font></p>

happens.) <br>
DOCTOR: Apparently it's not activated by movement unless what moves is
organic. <br>
HARRY: Hardly helps us, does it? We're organic. <br>
DOCTOR: Not down here we're not, Harry. <br>
HARRY: Oh, yes. Good piece of logical deduction, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WOMAN [OC]: Greetings, Citizen Volunteer. This is
the High Minister speaking on behalf of the World Executive. I salute
you who are about to make the supreme sacrifice. In a few minute, you
will pass beyond life. In case there is any fear in your heart and
doubt in your mind at this awesome moment, let me remind you that you
take with you all our past. You carry the torch that has been handed
down from generation to generation. <br>

HARRY: Where are we going with it? <br>
DOCTOR: To the far wall. <br>
HARRY: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: Inch it round your end. <br>
HARRY: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: One slip, Harry, and we'll be charcoal. Push on. <br>
HARRY: Right. <br>
(Keeping the solid side of the desk towards the light fitting, they
edge around the room to the control panels, landing up next to the
other desk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Psst, there it is. <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The trouble is, we can't reach it from here. <br>
HARRY: What can't we reach? <br>
DOCTOR: The auto-guard cut-out. Look, up there, see? Never mind.
Faithful old scarf. <br>
(The Doctor throws his scarf up towards the lever, but it gets zapped.)
<br>
HARRY: Bad luck. Jolly good try, though. <br>
DOCTOR: It isn't a game of cricket, Harry. <br>
HARRY: Sorry. Mind you, if I had a cricket ball, I'd jolly soon knock
that switch.&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: Will this do? <br>
(The Doctor takes a cricket ball from his pocket.) <br>
HARRY: Watch this, then. <br>
(Harry polishes the ball on his jacket and throws it. Zap! It comes
back down in pieces.) <br>
HARRY: Organic, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Afraid so. <br>
HARRY: Now what? <br>
DOCTOR: There's only one thing left. Risky, but it might work. You
don't want your other shoe, do you? <br>
HARRY: I suppose not. <br>
DOCTOR: Slip it off. Right. Now, I want you to throw it across the
room. When I give the word, understand? <br>
HARRY: All right. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm going to try to distract it. Let's hope it's not
double-barrelled. Ready? <br>
HARRY: Ready. <br>
DOCTOR: Now! <br>
(Harry throws the shoe towards the light fitting and we hear the zap.
At the same time, the Doctor leaps up and pulls the lever down. The
light fitting glides back up into the ceiling.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think we've done it, Harry. <br>
(They stand up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Pity about the scarf. Madame Nostradamus made it for me. A
witty little knitter. All right, Sarah, you can come out now. Never get
another one like it. <br>
HARRY: Look at my shoes. <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah? <br>
(A door closes off Sarah's alcove in the tranquiller room and a heavy
gas enters.)

circuitry.) <br>
DOCTOR: What a fool. Of course! <br>
HARRY: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Why didn't I realise? Short range matter transmitter. The
strange thing is, Harry, it's only for internal relay. <br>
HARRY: Doctor, I haven't the foggiest notion what you're on about. <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind. It just means that Sarah can't be far away. All
we've got to do is find her. Come on!

walkway around the outside of the Wheel. Windows top and bottom reveal
the inky blackness of space outside.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think we'll try this way first. <br>
(They head off anticlockwise. Harry points to a door.) <br>
HARRY: I say, what about the armoury? <br>
DOCTOR: Not very likely. <br>
(The transom finishes at a door marked Area Q. Orac from Blake's 7
shouts at them.) <br>
VOICE: This is a sterile area! Keep out! <br>
HARRY: It's just like a hospital. <br>
(The Doctor opens the door. It slides upwards.) <br>
HARRY: Well, ought we, do you think? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't be nervous, Harry. <br>
(We see them through green eyes, then something slides down a space by
some steps. Harry reacts.) <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
HARRY: I saw something moving. <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense, Harry. <br>
HARRY: I'm positive. I saw something move. <br>
DOCTOR: A trick of the light. <br>
(The door closes behind them.) <br>
HARRY: It wasn't a trick of the light. I saw something moving. <br>
(There is a green trail on the metal grating that is the floor of the
transom.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's like the trail left by a gastropod mollusc. <br>
HARRY: A slug? <br>
DOCTOR: Or a snail. <br>
HARRY: That size? Impossible. It couldn't have got through this grille.
<br>
DOCTOR: Very interesting. A multinucleate organism? <br>
HARRY: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Let's find Sarah first. Come on. <br>
(They move on to the intersection.) <br>
DOCTOR: This looks promising. <br>

HARRY: She's obviously not in here. <br>
DOCTOR: Decontamination chamber. Might make you feel a bit dizzy. <br>

It contains sixteen numbers blocks of six by six units.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think we're getting warm, Harry. Animal and Botanic. <br>
(The Doctor looks through a window in the door so labelled.) <br>
DOCTOR: Of course! That explains everything. Do you realise what this
is? Aren't you feeling better? <br>
HARRY: No, I'm not. <br>
DOCTOR: Then pull yourself together, man. This is fascinating! This is
a cryogenic repository. <br>
HARRY: Repository? For what? <br>
DOCTOR: Everything. Well, everything they considered worth preserving.
Look at this. <br>
(He presses a button next to the numbered blocks and unit five of row
two in block eleven comes out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Microfilm. It's a complete record. Music, history,
architecture, literature, engineering. Incredible. The entire body of
human thought and achievement. <br>
HARRY: Yes, but what's it all for? <br>
DOCTOR: Posterity? I don't know. Why build all this and send it into
space? <br>
HARRY: I say, couldn't be some sort of survival kit, could it? <br>
DOCTOR: Survival? <br>
HARRY: Yes, you know, the sort of thing they shove in lifeboats and
things. <br>
DOCTOR: You're improving, Harry. <br>
HARRY: Am I really? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, your mind is beginning to work. It's entirely due my
influence, of course. You mustn't take any credit. Now, what's missing?
<br>
HARRY: Missing? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. If we are to assume that some great cataclysm struck
Earth, and that before the end they launched this lifeboat, then the
one obvious missing element is man himself. What's happened to the
human species, Harry? <br>
(A door slides open behind them. They walk over and peer in.) <br>
HARRY: I say, what a place for a mortuary.

episode. White clothed people in plastic pods are arranged in pairs
around the wall. From the bottom the tiers are labelled D E and F
implying other rooms below and possibly above. Some pods are empty.) <br>
DOCTOR: This isn't a mortuary, Harry. Quite the reverse. <br>
HARRY: Reverse? I'd hardly call it a nursery. <br>
DOCTOR: Cryogenic chamber. <br>
HARRY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Old principle, but I've never seen it applied on this scale.
Look at them. <br>
(A short corridor lined with four pods leads into another chamber.) <br>
DOCTOR: There must be hundreds here. <br>
HARRY: Well, when you've seen one corpse, you've seen them all. <br>
DOCTOR: Corpse? These people aren't dead, Harry, they're asleep. The
entire human race awaiting the trumpet blast. <br>
(Harry opens a pod.) <br>
HARRY: Dead as a doorknocker.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Homo sapiens. What an inventive,
invincible species. It's only a few million years since they've crawled
up out of the mud and learned to walk. Puny, defenceless bipeds.
They've survived flood, famine and plague. They've survived cosmic wars
and holocausts, and now here they are amongst the stars, waiting to
begin a new life, ready to outsit eternity. They're indomitable.
Indomitable!

DOCTOR: What do you think you're doing, Harry? <br>
HARRY: Sorry to contradict you, Doctor. Not a flicker of life. <br>
DOCTOR: Suspended animation. <br>
HARRY: There are no metabolic functions at all. I mean, look at him.
Now, even in the deepest coma, the hair and fingernails continue to
grow. The epidermis <br>
DOCTOR: Total suspension, Harry. <br>
(The Doctor closes the pod.) <br>
DOCTOR: You can't survive ten thousand years in a coma. <br>
HARRY: Ten thousand years? <br>
DOCTOR: Fifty thousand years, a hundred thousand. Time is immaterial.
It's an amazing sight, isn't it? The entire human race in one room. All
colours, all creeds. All differences finally forgotten. <br>
HARRY: Doctor, are you serious? The entire human race? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's chosen descendents. The operation must have been
meticulously planned. Come on. <br>
HARRY: Where are we going now? <br>
DOCTOR: First to find Sarah, then we're going to shut down the systems.
We're intruders here, you know. <br>
HARRY: Just a minute, Doctor. Are you trying to tell that this is where
it's all going to end? In here? <br>
DOCTOR: Not end, Harry, just a pause. <br>
HARRY: But there's only a few hundred corpses, er, bodies in here. I
mean, what's happened to the rest of humanity? Some global catastrophe?
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and they saw it coming, and made provision for it as best
they could. Don't forget, it's something for you to be proud of. <br>
HARRY: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
HARRY: Look. <br>
(A green slime trail goes in or out of an air vent by the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oxygen? Radiant heat? But this deep in space? I wonder. <br>
HARRY: Perhaps it's some kind of mould. <br>
DOCTOR: Mould? <br>
HARRY: And that trail we saw in the corridor. <br>
DOCTOR: And that thing you saw moving in the corridor. <br>
HARRY: Dust. That, er, grille thing was a dust extractor. And then we
opened the door after umpteen years and caused a bit of a draught. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Very convincing. All the same, I think we'll just check a
few of the beds while we're here. <br>
HARRY: What are we checking for, exactly? <br>
DOCTOR: Just to make sure that everything's in order. <br>
HARRY: Right-o. <br>
(They look around the other pods, then Harry opens one.) <br>
HARRY: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: What have you found? <br>
(He goes over.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah! Oh, Sarah Jane. <br>
HARRY: We can't help her now. <br>
DOCTOR: No. She'll be like that for three thousand years at least. Even
if we had a resuscitation unit, it's doubtful that we could revive her
now. <br>
HARRY: There must be something we can do. What's would a resuscitation
unit look like? <br>
(Harry goes past a sign saying Do Not Enter Cryogenic Area When Light
Is On Or Floor Is In Motion and opens a cupboard labelled Medic 2.) <br>
DOCTOR: Very like an oxygen cylinder. <br>
(Harry opens cupboard Medic 1) <br>
DOCTOR: You'll recognise it if there is one. <br>

HARRY: Well, it's dead, anyway. <br>
DOCTOR: Very dead. Almost mummified. <br>
HARRY: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: That's something we can leave till later. No sign of the
resuscitation tank? <br>
HARRY: I hardly had a chance to look for one. <br>
(The Doctor takes an orange perspex box from the cupboard.) <br>
DOCTOR: Emergency medical kit, wouldn't you say? <br>
HARRY: A bit beyond me, I'm afraid. <br>
DOCTOR: There must be something there that would help Sarah, but what?
What? <br>
HARRY: Doctor, look. <br>
(Pod D1 across the room is active.) <br>
DOCTOR: Of course! They don't need a tank. The resuscitation phase is
programmed in. <br>
(The Doctor opens the lid to reveal a woman with yellow shoulder
flashes on her white suit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look, she's starting to breathe. <br>
HARRY: Yes, I think she is. <br>
DOCTOR: No doubt about it. <br>
HARRY: That means there's hope for Sarah. Yes, look, she's moving. <br>
(The woman is holding her arms out. Harry offers the open medical box.)
<br>
HARRY: Something you want? <br>
(She takes a ball and inserts it into a star-ended spray gun, then
presses it to her heart.) <br>
HARRY: Hey, look, can't I do that for you? Independent sort of bird,
isn't she. <br>
DOCTOR: Leave her, Harry. <br>
HARRY: Yes, but she's <br>
DOCTOR: There's nothing you can do. She knows what she's doing. <br>
(The woman slumps then straightens up and steps down from the pod. It
switches off. She looks around the room.) <br>
VIRA: Oh! Explain yourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there isn't very much to explain. We're just travellers
in space like yourself. <br>
VIRA: That is not adequate. <br>
HARRY: My name's Sullivan. Surgeon Lieutenant Harry Sullivan, actually.
And, er, this is the Doctor. <br>
VIRA: You claim to be med-techs? <br>
HARRY: Sorry? <br>
DOCTOR: My doctorate is purely honorary, and Harry here is only
qualified to work on sailors. <br>
VIRA: My name is Vira. I am a first med-tech. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm delighted to hear it. You see, we happen to be in
rather desperate need of medical help. <br>
(The Doctor wheels a box over to Sarah's pod.) <br>
VIRA: This female is a stranger. <br>
HARRY: She's a friend of ours. She got caught in the machinery. <br>
VIRA: She was not among the chosen. <br>
HARRY: Well, she's among the chosen now, isn't she. <br>
DOCTOR: Is there any way of reversing the cryogenic process? <br>
VIRA: That can be dangerous. How long since she underwent tissue
irradiation? <br>
HARRY: Can't be more than an hour, can it, Doctor? We haven't been here
more than an hour altogether. <br>
(Vira puts a circlet on Sarah's head and takes a reading.) <br>
VIRA: Receding neural activity. <br>
HARRY: Is there anything you can do for her? <br>
VIRA: Is she of value? <br>
HARRY: Of value? She's a human being like ourselves! What sort of
question's that? <br>
DOCTOR: The answer is yes. <br>
VIRA: Your comrade is a romantic. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps we both are. <br>
VIRA: I will inject a monod block. <br>
HARRY: Ah, that'll do the trick, eh? <br>
VIRA: Your colony speech has no meaning. <br>
HARRY: I mean it's bring her round, reverse the process. <br>
(Vira injects Sarah's arm.) <br>
VIRA: She will either survive or die. The action of the antiprotonic is
not predictable. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. You've changed her body into a battlefield. <br>
VIRA: Battlefield? I hypoid in classicals, but you dawn-timers have a
language all of your won. <br>
DOCTOR: We do seem to have a small communications problem. <br>
HARRY: I wish there was something I could do. <br>
VIRA: It is done. There is nothing further. As she revives, her
electrical field will draw power from the bionosphere. <br>
(Vira takes her trolley to another flashing pod, D2. She opens it to
reveal a man with red shoulder flashes.) <br>
VIRA: Here is our prime unit. <br>
HARRY: Prime unit? <br>
VIRA: Er, our leader, I think you would say. Noah. <br>
HARRY: Noah? Oh, I see. As in Noah's Ark, eh? <br>
VIRA: It is a name from mythology. His real name is Lazar, but we
called him Noah as an amusement. <br>
HARRY: Er, joke? <br>
VIRA: Joke? Oh, yes. There was not much joke in the last days. <br>
DOCTOR: What happened in the last days, Vira? <br>
VIRA: Your colony has no records, no history? Where are you from? <br>
HARRY: London, actually. England. The Earth. <br>
VIRA: That is not possible. The Earth is dead. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you're probably wrong about that. <br>
VIRA: The solar flares destroyed all life on Earth. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Solar flares. I see. <br>
VIRA: Our scientists calculated it would be five thousand years before
the biosphere became viable again. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the absolute minimum, I'd say. But I'm afraid I've
something of a shock for you, Vira. <br>
VIRA: Shock? <br>
DOCTOR: You've overslept by several thousand years. You see, when we
came here, we found a massive systems failure. <br>
VIRA: The systems have no capacity for failure. <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly not. But a long time ago, when you were dormant, you
had a visitor. Come, I'll show it to you. <br>
(They go over to the dead insect.) <br>
VIRA: Is it from space? How did it get here? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know yet. But observe the size of the brain pan. It had
a purpose in coming here, and once inside, it severed most of the
satellite's control systems, including your alarm clock, so to speak. <br>
VIRA: What purpose? <br>
(As the satellite continues on through space, a large maggot with skin
like green bubblewrap wriggles its way through the hidden parts. Harry
checks on Sarah the old fashioned way. Vira is checking other pods.) <br>
HARRY: Still no change, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No. For once in my life I feel surplus to requirements. <br>
(The maggot uses a pseudopod to unlock a hatch.) <br>
VIRA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
VIRA: There's a technical fault in the bionosphere. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think the fault's at this end. It's in the main power
supply. <br>
VIRA: It must be corrected. If his heart stops now, there's nothing I
can do. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I noticed the Ark has a secondary power supply.
Harry, you stay here and keep an eye on things. <br>
HARRY: Right-o. <br>
VIRA: Yes, but <br>
(The Doctor leaves.) <br>
VIRA: The Ark was designed to have a negative fault capacity. <br>
HARRY: Gremlins can get into everything, old girl. First law of the
sea. <br>
(Back in secondary control, the Doctor works on the console. Noah takes
a deep breath.) <br>
HARRY: There you are. What did I tell you? The Doctor's a first class
boffin. <br>
VIRA: Good. He will revive soon. <br>

NOAH: They? <br>
VIRA: There are three of them. Another male called the Doctor, and that

HARRY: Vira, she's coming round. <br>
NOAH: There was a regressive faction among the volunteers for Colony
Nine. <br>
VIRA: With a zero zero survival predic. One generation. <br>
NOAH: Even so, our genetic pool has been balanced, cross-matched,
compat-evaluated. Three random units could threaten our survival. <br>

VIRA: Noah will not permit contamination of the genetic pool. All
regressive transmitters have been eliminated. <br>
HARRY: Oh, come off it. We're not contaminating anybody. <br>

consider your destruction is not necessary. <br>

DOCTOR: Four whole days? At the rate at which the Wirrn are developing,
they'll have pupated to imago long before then, and you know what that
means. <br>

DOCTOR: Obviously the creature's lungs recycle the wastes, almost
certainly by enzymes. Quite wonderful. Carbon dioxide back to oxygen. <br>
SARAH: You mean the way plants make oxygen? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly right. It must live in space, probably just
occasionally visiting a planetary atmosphere for food and oxygen, the
way a whale rises from the ocean. <br>

DOCTOR: It should work. The coil isn't giving a strong enough stimulus.
I'll have to link in my own cerebral cortex. That's the only thing. <br>

DOCTOR: I know. Two more leads, Rogin. <br>
VIRA: The power could burn out a living brain! <br>

VIRA: I cannot permit it. The shock might kill you. <br>

That could be dangerous. <br>
SARAH: Do you have to do it, Doctor? <br>
HARRY: Yes, why take the risk? <br>
DOCTOR: If I can find out what it was that killed that creature, we
might have a chance of fighting the Wirrn. That's our only hope. <br>

DOCTOR: High voltage power. If we can somehow send enough electrical
power through the bulkheads of the cryogenic chamber <br>
SARAH: Like an electric fence? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. The Wirrn would never dare to cross it. The only problem
is we don't have any electrical power and they control its sources, the
solar stacks. <br>
HARRY: Well, we can forget that idea then, can't we. <br>
SARAH: Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Unless we can lure them out of the infrastructure. <br>
SARAH: No, wait a minute. <br>
VIRA: How can we do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Bait. Human bait! If one of us could distract them for a few
moments, I might be able to get down there and turn the power on. <br>
SARAH: Doctor, will you listen? <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah, we're trying to make a plan. <br>
VIRA: It wouldn't work, Doctor. If they have Dune's knowledge, they'd
simply turn it off again. <br>
DOCTOR: Not if we electrify the switch itself. <br>
ROGIN: That would take a long time. Those switch boxes are
non-conductive. <br>
DOCTOR: Well we can't do without oxygen indefinitely. What was that you
were trying to say, Sarah? <br>
SARAH: I was just wondering about the transport ship that Noah
mentioned. <br>
DOCTOR: What about it? <br>
SARAH: Well, surely it has its own power system, doesn't it? <br>
ROGIN: Four granovox turbines! That ship can generate twice the power
of the Ark. <br>
DOCTOR: How can we reach it? <br>
(Vira calls up the Ark's schematics on the monitor.) <br>
VIRA: Here's the connecting ramp. It's less than a hundred metres from
this control room. <br>
ROGIN: The only trouble is, how do we run a cable from the ship to the
cryogenic chamber? If it's in the open, they'll cut it. <br>
DOCTOR: Aren't there conduits? <br>
ROGIN: Yes, but they're only about this wide. <br>
(Rogin indicates a small shoulder width.) <br>
ROGIN: We'd need a mechanical cable runner. <br>
SARAH: Why can't I take that cable through? Well, I'm about that wide. <br>
HARRY: It's hardly a job for you, Sarah. <br>
ROGIN: I reckon she might just squeeze through, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Good girl, Sarah. Come on, we'd better hurry. The Wirrn are
going to start moving any moment. You four go to the transport ship and
I'll start wiring up the cryogenic chamber. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Rogin carries a large coil of cable into the
blast area. The exhausts of the shuttle are above them.) <br>
ROGIN: This is the transport ship, and here's the conduit. We'll
connect one end up here, and you'll have to drag the other end through.
Do you think you can manage it? <br>
SARAH: I'll have to. <br>
VIRA: Good luck. <br>
(Rogin opens a hatch in the base of the shuttle, and a ladder is
lowered down. He climbs up.) <br>
HARRY: It seems very narrow, Sarah. Does that lead straight to the
cryogenic chamber? <br>
VIRA: No, there are many junctions. <br>
HARRY: How's she going to find her way in the dark and everything? <br>
VIRA: We'll give her a two-way radio from the ship. We have a plan of
the conduits. We can guide you. <br>
ROGIN [OC]: All right, Commander. </font></p>

could stop us. <br>
VIRA: You've completed all checks? <br>
ROGIN: Yes, Commander. <br>
VIRA: Right. Waste no more time. Give the girl the radio. <br>
(In the cryogenic chamber, the Doctor is attaching cables when he hears
a noise. It is a Wirrn entering the Tranquiller room next door. The
Doctor shrugs and continues with his work.) </font></p>

a pod as the Wirrn looks around.) </font></p>

SARAH [OC]: Got you. (grunts) <br>
ROGIN: Yes. Sarah? <br>
SARAH [OC]: Yes? <br>

(Sarah inches forward carefully, pulling herself along with her arms.
She spots a Wirrn through a small grille, and it sees her. She tries to
hurry. The Wirrn has left the cryogenic chamber, and the Doctor has
completed wiring the place up. He opens a triangular hatch above the
smashed grille and listens.) </font></p>

(An insect arm reaches through the grille and wraps around Sarah's
legs.) <br>
SARAH: Oh! Doctor! <br>
(The Doctor grabs Sarah and pulls her back. Then he grabs his free
cable and jabs it at the Wirrn's head. There is a flash, then it
retreats.) <br>
DOCTOR: Cheer up, we're still on our feet. <br>
SARAH: Those things are so venomous. They'll never give up. <br>
