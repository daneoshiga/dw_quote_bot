speaks to a man wearing a tattered Confederate Army uniform.) <br>
IDRIS: Will it be me, Uncle? <br>
UNCLE: Yes, it's going to be you. I only wish I could go in your place,
Idris. Nah, I don't, because it's really going to hurt. <br>
(An Ood with glowing green eyes appears behind Idris.) <br>
IDRIS: It's starting. What will happen? <br>
AUNTIE: Oh. Er, Nephew will drain your mind and your soul from your
body and leave your body empty. <br>
(Idris goes up onto a platform with a bit of alien tech dangling around
the place. The Ood holds Idris' head.) <br>
IDRIS: I'm scared. <br>
AUNTIE: I expect so, dear. But soon you'll have a new soul. There'll be
a Time Lord coming.

King after all, it was the real one. Fortunately, I was able to
re-attach the head. <br>
RORY: Do you believe any of this stuff? <br>
AMY: I was there. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's the warning lights. I'm getting rid of those. They
never stop. <br>
RORY: Hey. You're still thinking about it, aren't you? <br>
AMY: Oh, shush. We saw him die. <br>
RORY: Yeah, two hundred years in the future. <br>
AMY: Yes, but it's still going to happen. <br>
(Rat tat a tat tat on the Tardis door.) <br>
AMY: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: The door. It knocked. <br>
RORY: Right. We are in deep space. <br>
DOCTOR: Very, very deep. <br>
(Shave and a haircut, two bits.) <br>
DOCTOR: And somebody's knocking. <br>
(The Doctor opens the doors. A small glowing box is outside.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come here. Come here, you scrumptious little beauty. <br>
(The box flies inside and ends up hitting the Doctor on the chest.) <br>
RORY: A box? <br>
AMY: Doctor, what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: I've got mail. Time Lord emergency messaging system. In an
emergency, we'd wrap up thoughts in psychic containers and send them
through time and space. Anyway, there's a living Time Lord still out
there, and it's one of the good ones. <br>
RORY: You said there weren't any other Time Lords left. <br>
DOCTOR: There are no Time Lords left anywhere in the universe. But the
universe isn't where we're going. See that snake? <br>
(The Ourobouros, the snake swallowing its own tail.) <br>
DOCTOR: The mark of the Corsair. Fantastic bloke. He had that snake as
a tattoo in every regeneration. Didn't feel like himself unless he had
the tattoo. Or herself, a couple of times. Ooo, she was a bad girl. <br>
(Things go Bang!) <br>
RORY: Oh, what is happening? <br>
DOCTOR: We're leaving the universe. <br>
AMY: How can you leave the universe? <br>
DOCTOR: With enormous difficulty. Right now I'm burning up Tardis rooms
to give us some welly. Goodbye, swimming pool. Goodbye, scullery.
Sayonara, squash court seven. <br>
(Whoosh, thump, crash, then all is still and silent.) <br>
AMY: Okay, okay. Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Outside the universe, where we've never, ever been. <br>
(The lights go out in the Tardis.) <br>
RORY: Is that meant to be happening? <br>
DOCTOR: The power, it's draining. Everything's draining. But it can't.
That's, that's impossible. <br>
RORY: What is that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's as if the Matrix, the soul of the Tardis, has just
vanished. Where would it go? <br>
(Idris gasps and sits up again. A little golden energy comes out of her
mouth, to the accompaniment of the Tardis sound.)

AMY: So what kind of trouble's your friend in? <br>
DOCTOR: He was in a bind. A bit of a pickle. Sort of distressed. <br>
AMY: Ah, you can't just say you don't know. <br>
RORY: But what is this place? The scrap yard at the end of the
universe? <br>
DOCTOR: Not end of, outside of. <br>
RORY: How we can we be outside the universe? The universe is
everything. <br>
DOCTOR: Imagine a great big soap bubble with one of those tiny little
bubbles on the outside. <br>
RORY: Okay. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's nothing like that. Completely drained. Look at her. <br>
AMY: Wait. So we're in a tiny bubble universe, sticking to the side of
the bigger bubble universe? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. No. But if it helps, yes. This place is full of rift
energy. She'll probably refuel just by being here. Now, this place.
What do we think, eh? Gravity's almost Earth normal, air's breathable,
but it smells like <br>
AMY: Armpits. <br>
DOCTOR: Armpits. <br>
RORY: What about all this stuff? Where did this come from? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's a rift. Now and then stuff gets sucked through
it. Not a bubble, a plughole. The universe has a plughole and we've
just fallen down it. <br>
IDRIS: Thief! Thief! You're my thief! <br>
AUNTIE: She's dangerous. Guard yourselves. <br>
(Idris runs up to the Doctor.) <br>
IDRIS: Look at you. Goodbye. No, not goodbye, what's the other one? <br>
(Idris kisses the Doctor.) <br>
UNCLE: Watch out. Careful. Keep back from her. Welcome, strangers.
Lovely. Sorry about the mad person. <br>
DOCTOR: Why am I a thief? What have I stolen? <br>
IDRIS: Me. You're going to steal me. No, you have stolen me. You are
stealing me. Oh tenses are difficult, aren't they? <br>
AUNTIE: Oh. Oh, we are sorry, my dove. She's off her head. They call me
Auntie. <br>
UNCLE: And I'm Uncle. I'm everybody's Uncle. Just keep back from this
one. She bites! <br>
IDRIS: Do I? Excellent. <br>
(Idris bites the Doctor's ear.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! Ow! <br>
IDRIS: Biting's excellent. It's like kissing, only there's a winner. <br>
UNCLE: So sorry. She's doolally. <br>
IDRIS: No, I'm not doolally. I'm, I'm. It's on the tip of my tongue.
I've just had a new idea about kissing. Come here, you. <br>
AUNTIE: No, Idris, no. <br>
IDRIS: Oh, but now you're angry. No, you're not. You will be angry. The
little boxes will make you angry. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry? The little what? Boxes? <br>
IDRIS: Oh, ho, no. Your chin is hilarious. It means the smell of dust
after rain. <br>
RORY: What does? <br>
IDRIS: Petrichor. <br>
RORY: But I didn't ask. <br>
IDRIS: Not yet. But you will. <br>
AUNTIE: No, no, Idris. I think you should have a rest. <br>
IDRIS: Rest. Yes, yes. Good idea. I'll just see if there's an off
switch. <br>
(Idris collapses.) <br>
UNCLE: Is that it? She dead now. So sad. <br>
RORY: No, she's still breathing. <br>
UNCLE: Nephew, take Idris somewhere she can not bite people. <br>
(Nephew is the Ood.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, hello! <br>
AMY: Doctor, what is that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, it's all right. It's an Ood. Oods are good. Love an
Ood. Hello, Ood. Can't you talk? Oh, I see. It's damaged. May I? It
might just be on the wrong frequency. <br>
AUNTIE: Nephew was broken when he came here. Why, he was half dead.
House repaired him. House repaired all of us. <br>
CORSAIR [OC]: If you are receiving this message, please help me. Send a
signal to the High Council of the Time Lords on Gallifrey. Tell them
that I am still alive. I don't know where I am. I'm on some rock-like
planet. <br>
(Behind the message is a lot of other voices trying to speak at the
same time.) <br>
RORY: What was that? Was that him? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. It's picking up something else. But that's, that's not
possible. That's, that's. Who else is here? Tell me. Show me. Show me. <br>
AUNTIE: Just what you see. Just the four of us, and the House. Nephew,
will you take Idris somewhere safe where she can't hurt nobody? <br>
DOCTOR: The House? What's the House? <br>
AUNTIE: House is all around you, my sweets. You are standing on him.
This is the House. This world. Would you like to meet him? <br>
RORY: Meet him? <br>
DOCTOR: I'd love to. <br>
UNCLE: This way. Come, please. Come. <br>
AMY: What's wrong? What were those voices? <br>
DOCTOR: Time Lords. It's not just the Corsair. Somewhere close by there
are lots and lots of Time Lords.

and replaced. The Doctor looks down the grating on the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: I see. This asteroid is sentient. <br>
AUNTIE: We walk on his back, breathe his air, eat his food. <br>
AMY: Smell its armpits. <br>
(House speaks through Uncle and Auntie as if they are marionettes. It
is a nice, refined voice.) <br>
HOUSE [OC]: And do my will. You are most welcome, travellers. <br>
AMY: Doctor, that voice. That's the asteroid talking? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. So you're like a sea urchin. Hard outer surface, that's
the planet we're walking on. Big, squashy, oogly thing inside, that's
you. <br>
HOUSE [OC]: That is correct, Time Lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. So you've met Time Lords before? <br>
HOUSE [OC]: Many travellers have come through the rift, like Auntie and
Uncle and Nephew. I repair them when they break. <br>
DOCTOR: So there are Time Lords here, then? <br>
HOUSE [OC]: Not any more, but there have been many Tardises on my back
in days gone by. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there won't be any more after us. Last Time Lord. Last
Tardis. <br>
HOUSE [OC]: A pity. Your people were so kind. Be here in safety,
Doctor. Rest, feed, if you will. <br>
RORY: We're not actually going to stay here, are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it seems like a friendly planet. Literally. Mind if we
poke around a bit? <br>
AUNTIE: You can look all you want. Go. Look. (to Amy) House loves you. <br>

DOCTOR: No. There are Time Lords here. I heard them and they need me. <br>
AMY: You told me about your people, and you told me what you did. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, but if they're like the Corsair, they're good one and
I can save them. <br>
AMY: And then tell them you destroyed the others? <br>
DOCTOR: I can explain. Tell them why I had to. <br>
AMY: You want to be forgiven. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't we all? <br>

finds at least 10 of those message boxes all chattering away.) <br>

WOMAN [OC]: Structural integrity failure. Damage to dimensional
stabiliser. <br>
MAN 2: If you can hear, come and help. <br>
(Uncle and Auntie come up behind him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Just admiring your Time Lord distress signal collection. Nice
job. Brilliant job. Really thought I had some friends here, but this is
what the Ood translator picked up. Cries for help from the long dead.
How many Time Lords have you lured here the way you lured me, and what
happened to them all? <br>
AUNTIE: House, House is kind and he is wise. <br>
DOCTOR: House repairs you when you break. Yes, I know. But how does he
mend you? You've got the eyes of a twenty year old. <br>
UNCLE: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Oh, no, I mean it literally. Your eyes are thirty years
younger than the rest of you. Your ears don't match, your right arm is
two inches longer than you're left, and how's your dancing? Because
you've got two left feet. Patchwork people. You've been repaired and
patched up so often, I doubt there's anything left of what used to be
you. I had an umbrella like you once. <br>
(Auntie's forearm has a snake tattoo.) <br>
AUNTIE: Oh, now, it's been a great arm for me, this. <br>
DOCTOR: Corsair. <br>
AUNTIE: He was a strapping big bloke, wasn't he, Uncle? <br>
UNCLE: Big fellow. <br>
AUNTIE: I got the arm and then Uncle got the spine and the kidneys. <br>
UNCLE: Kidneys. <br>
DOCTOR: You gave me hope, and then you took it away. That's enough to
make anyone dangerous. God knows what it will do to me. Basically, run!

DOCTOR: No, you're not. You're a bitey, mad lady. The Tardis is up and
downy stuff in a big blue box. <br>

piece when you were young, and the first time you touched my console
you said <br>
DOCTOR: I said you were the most beautiful thing I had ever known. <br>
IDRIS: And then you stole me. And I stole you. <br>
DOCTOR: I borrowed you. <br>

taken. What makes you think I would ever give you back? <br>

IDRIS: So much bigger on the inside. I'm, oh, what is that word? It's
so big, so complicated. It's so sad. <br>

tiny human head? What does it want you for? <br>

DOCTOR: House eats Tardises? <br>
IDRIS: There you go. What are fish fingers? <br>
DOCTOR: When do I say that? <br>
IDRIS: Any second. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. House feeds on rift energy and Tardises are bursting
with it. And not raw, all lovely and cooked. Processed food. Mmm, fish
fingers. <br>
IDRIS: Do fish have fingers? <br>
DOCTOR: But you can't eat a Tardis. it would destroy you. Unless,
unless <br>
IDRIS: Unless you deleted the Tardis Matrix first. <br>
DOCTOR: So it deleted you. <br>
IDRIS: But House can't just delete a Tardis' consciousness. That would
blow a hole in the universe. So he pulls out the Matrix, sticks it in a
living receptacle and then it feeds off the remaining Artron energy.
Oh. You were about to say all that. I don't suppose you have to now. <br>

HOUSE [OC]: You're half right. I mean, you are in the Tardis. What a
great adventure. I should have done this half a million years ago. So,
Amy, Rory, why shouldn't I just kill you now?

pop off. <br>

AUNTIE: It's your fault, isn't it, sweets? Because you told House it
was the last Tardis. House can't feed on them if there's none more
coming, can he? <br>
UNCLE: So now he's off to your universe to find more Tardises. <br>
DOCTOR: It won't. <br>

could blow the casing in no time. No, stop it. Don't get emotional.
Hmm. That's what the orangey girl says. You're the Doctor. Focus. <br>
DOCTOR: On what? How? I'm a madman with a box, without a box. I'm stuck
down the plughole at the end of the universe on a stupid old junkyard.
Ooo. <br>
IDRIS: Ooo what? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not. <br>
IDRIS: Not what? <br>

out of broken remnants of a hundred different models. And you don't

IDRIS: No, but I always took you where you needed to go. <br>
DOCTOR: You did. Look at us talking. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could
always talk, even when you're stuck inside the box? <br>

room. Then the four of them appear.) <br>

automatically deposited in the main control room. But thanks for the

worthy opponent. <br>

last but definitely not least, the Tardis Matrix herself, a living
consciousness you ripped out of this very control room and locked up
into a human body. And look at her. <br>
RORY: Doctor, she's stopped breathing. <br>
HOUSE [OC]: Enough. That is enough. <br>
DOCTOR: No. It's never enough. You forced the Tardis into a body so
she'd burn out safely a very long way away from this control room. A
flesh body can't hold the Tardis Matrix and live. Look at her body,
House. <br>
HOUSE [OC]: And you think I should mourn her? <br>
DOCTOR: No. I think you should be very, very careful about what you let
back into this control room. You took her from her home. But now she's
back in the box again, and she's free. <br>
(The golden energy streams from Idris into the console then out again

RORY: Sorry. At the end, she was talking. She kept repeating something.
I don't know what it meant. <br>

RORY: No. I watched her die. I shouldn't let it get to me, but it still
does. I'm a nurse. <br>

alive. Best thing there is. Being alive right now, that's all that
counts. Nearly finished. Two more minutes, then we're off. The Eye of
Orion's restful, if you like restful. I can never really get the hang
of restful. What do you think, dear? Where shall we take the kids this
time? <br>
AMY: Look at you pair. It's always you and her, isn't it, long after
the rest of us have gone. A boy and his box, off to see the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you say that as if it's a bad thing. But honestly, it's
the best thing there is. The House deleted all the bedrooms. I should
probably make you two a new bedroom. You'd like that, wouldn't you? <br>
AMY: Okay. Er, Doctor, this time could we lose the bunk beds? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Bunk beds are cool. A bed with a ladder. You can't beat
that. It's your room. Out those stairs, keep walking till you find it.
Off you pop. <br>
RORY: Doctor, do you have a room? <br>
(Amy pulls Rory away. Later, the Doctor's work is finished.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you there? Can you hear me? Oh, I'm a silly old. Okay. The
Eye of Orion, or wherever we need to go. <br>
