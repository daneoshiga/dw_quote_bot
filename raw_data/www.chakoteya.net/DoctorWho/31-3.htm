CHURCHILL: Yes. He approached one of our brass hats a few months ago.

DOCTOR: Yes. Right. So destroy them. Exterminate them. <br>

DALEK: Please excuse me. I have duties to perform. <br>

DOCTOR: You're resisting, Winston. The whole world knows you're

CHURCHILL: But for how long? Millions of innocent lives will be saved
if I use these Ironsides now. <br>
DALEK: Can I be of assistance? <br>
DOCTOR: Shut it. Listen to me. Just listen. The Daleks have no
conscience, no mercy, no pity. They are my oldest and deadliest enemy.
You cannot trust them. <br>

them. <br>

DOCTOR: How did you do it? Come up with the idea? <br>
BRACEWELL: How does the muse of invention come to anyone? <br>
DOCTOR: But you get a lot of these clever notions, do you? <br>
BRACEWELL: Well, ideas just seem to teem from my head. Wonderful
things, like. Let me show you. Some musings on the potential of
hypersonic flight. Gravity bubbles that can sustain life outside of the
terrestrial atmosphere. Came to me in the bath. <br>
DOCTOR: And are these your ideas or theirs? <br>
BRACEWELL: Oh no, no, no. These robots are entirely under my control,
Doctor. They are. <br>

BRACEWELL: Thank you. The perfect servant, and the perfect warrior. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know what you're up to, Professor, but whatever they've
promised, you cannot trust them. Call them what you like, the Daleks

CHURCHILL: Yes, Doctor. Death to our enemies. Death to the forces of
darkness, and death to the Third Reich. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Winston, and death to everyone else too. <br>

DALEK: To win the war. <br>

DALEK: I do not understand. <br>
DOCTOR: This war, against the Nazis, or your war? The war against the
rest of the Universe? The war against all life forms that are not
Dalek? <br>
