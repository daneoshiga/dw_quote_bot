<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (On the south side of the River Thames, just west
of Tower Bridge, are a series of old wharfs and warehouses that have
been yuppified since 1984. In Shad Thames, a man tucks a cigarette
behind his ear, then hears a scream some way off. Two men in non-period
overalls burst out of a warehouse.) <br>
STIEN: Which way? <br>
(Everyone say Hi to that bemused Likely Lad, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079815/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Rodney Bewes</a>.) <br>
GALLOWAY: Does it matter? <br>
(They run. There is another scream, and the man watches a whole bunch
of futuristically dressed but scruffy men burst out onto the
cobblestones.) <br>
(A dark man with dreadlocks speaks.) <br>
MAN: Where are we? <br>
(They try to hold the warehouse doors shut, but cannot. They also run,
splitting into two groups.) <br>
MAN: Run! <br>
(Two armed Police Constables come out, watched by a Police Inspector,
and walk up and down the street. Then they fire on the fleeing men. The
man with the cigarette is also killed. When only dead men remain in the
street, the Inspector steps forward and slides a control on a hand-held
device. The bodies of the victims glow purple and disappear, and then
he does. The Police Constables nod to each other and continue to patrol
as normal. Stien and Galloway come out of hiding.) <br>
STIEN: Where've they gone? <br>
GALLOWAY: Where'd you think. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Battle cruiser]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Police Inspector materialises in a bay with
the bodies. He throws his cap down in disgust.) <br>
LYTTON: That was a shambles. <br>
TROOPER: The escape was prevented? <br>
LYTTON: They got out of the warehouse. It should never have happened.
And who ordered the use of machine pistols? <br>
TROOPER: Standing orders. Nothing anachronistic is to be taken to
Earth. <br>
LYTTON: So instead we slaughter valuable specimens. Next time, stun
lasers are to be used. <br>
TROOPER: It was an unfortunate mistake. <br>
LYTTON: Make it your last, otherwise the next execution squad will be
coming for you. </font></p>

from the end of the last story. Turlough is thrown against the wall,
and Tegan goes to help.) <br>
TEGAN: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: I can't free the Tardis from the Time Corridor! <br>
TEGAN: Is there anything you can do? <br>
DOCTOR: No, too much turbulence. Hold on. Things must stabilise soon. </font></p>

GALLOWAY: You said you were a soldier. Have you no sense of loyalty? <br>
STIEN: I'm a Quartermaster Sergeant. I'm not combat trained. I can't
afford your sort of principles. Look at me, I'm not exactly in
condition. I can't even run properly. <br>
(They go up a flight of stairs into a room.) <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know. <br>
TEGAN: Can't we materialise? <br>
TURLOUGH: No, not until we're free of the Time Corridor. We risk
break-up. <br>
TEGAN: Is that true? <br>
DOCTOR: Not if I have anything to do with it. <br>

Bell tolls.) <br>

STIEN: They could have closed the Time Corridor down. Let's get out of
here. I'm scared. <br>
GALLOWAY: The entrance to the corridor is round here somewhere. <br>
STIEN: There's nothing there now. What was that? <br>
GALLOWAY: A rodent. <br>
(Footsteps nearby.) <br>
STIEN: Wearing combat boots? <br>
GALLOWAY: Back to the stairs, quick. <br>

STIEN: Galloway? <br>

STIEN: Galloway! <br>

behind.) </font></p>

DOCTOR: The right moment. The time stress on the Tardis varies greatly.
I'm waiting for the right moment to break out of the Time Corridor. <br>
TEGAN: Can I get to my room? I feel sick. <br>
DOCTOR: Too late, Tegan. Hold on. <br>
(The Tardis tilts and shudders rapidly.) <br>

wearing a small cap with a very long peak that reaches almost to the
end of his nose. A large globe in front of him powers up.) <br>

uniform is walking down a slightly shabby corridor with a black man,
who speaks.) <br>
MERCER: I don't believe this. How long has the station been in this
state? <br>
STYLES: Since regular inspections ceased. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to the aristocratic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0502218/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rula Lenska</a>.) <br>
MERCER: This place is falling to pieces. <br>
STYLES: Huh. And you're seeing it on a good day. If you wanted to see
everything spick and span, you shouldn't have asked for a transfer to a
prison. Come on! <br>
(She kicks a door to make it open.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Gleaming white and clean.) <br>
MERCER: How'd you cope with that mess? <br>
STYLES: By ignoring it. My only concern is the medical welfare of the
crew and the prisoner. <br>
MERCER: Isn't that rather a narrow view of your responsibilities? <br>
STYLES: Oh, do shut up, will you? It's the only way to stay sane.
You've only been here three days. You know nothing. <br>
MERCER: I've been here long enough to learn that the morale on this
station is appalling. <br>
STYLES: If the Captain doesn't care, why should I? <br>
MERCER: Why, indeed? <br>
STYLES: Look, my tour of duty finishes here in eight weeks. I'm
dependent on a good report from the Captain for my next promotion. <br>
MERCER: I see. <br>
STYLES: Oh no, I don't think you do. If I don't get a good report, I
could be here for another two years. <br>
MERCER: If Control were aware of the morale on this station, the
Captain wouldn't be in command. <br>
STYLES: It's been tried before, usually by inexperienced new boys like
you. <i>And the way you're carrying on, you are going to end up
exactly like the others.<br>
MERCER: Meaning?&nbsp;<br>
STYLES: Dead. You are the third security officer we've had here in two
years.&nbsp;</i> </font></p>

a communications piece in her ear at all times.) <br>
OSBORN: How long is your tour of duty? <br>
MERCER: Two years. <br>
OSBORN: Oh? The Captain normally allows new arrivals to settle in
before subjecting them to the tedium of Officer of the Watch. What did
you do? <br>
MERCER: I complained. <br>
OSBORN: Someone should have warned you. <br>
MERCER: I had every right. Have you seen the state of the defence
system? <br>
OSBORN: You fear an attack? <br>
MERCER: That's not the point. <br>
OSBORN: Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. The only ship we ever see around
here is our own supply vessel. <br>
CREWMAN: I think you may have spoken too soon. Sensors have picked up a
ship in warp drive just enter the exclusion zone. <br>
MERCER: Inform the Captain. <br>
OSBORN: I wouldn't bother him. Not yet. It could be anything. Let the
fighters check it out first. <br>

are defenceless. <br>
(The spaceship fires twin lasers at the station.) <br>
CREWMAN: Look, we should surrender! <br>
MERCER: No! <br>

redesign the Daleks. Kiston will confirm I am telling the truth. <br>
KISTON: It is so. <br>
DAVROS: My mistake was making them totally ruthless. It restricted
their ability to cope with creatures who rely not only on logic, but
instinct and intuition. That is a factor I wish to correct. <br>
DOCTOR: And compassion? Are they to be programmed for that? <br>
DAVROS: They will learn to recognise the strength that can be drawn
