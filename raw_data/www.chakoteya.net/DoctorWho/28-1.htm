looking at the city.) <br>
DOCTOR: So, the year five billion, the sun expands, the Earth gets
roasted. <br>
ROSE: That was our first date. <br>
DOCTOR: We had chips. So anyway, planet gone, all rocks and dust, but
the human race lives on, spread out across the stars. Soon as the Earth
burns up, oh yeah, they get all nostalgic, big revival movement, but
then find this place. Same size as the Earth, same air, same orbit.
Lovely. Call goes out, the humans move in. <br>
ROSE: What's the city called? <br>
DOCTOR: New New York. <br>
ROSE: Oh, come on. <br>
DOCTOR: It is. It's the city of New New York. Strictly speaking, it's
the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New New New

their side of the river.) <br>
ROSE: Why, what is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Some sort of hospital. Green moon on the side. That's the
universal symbol for hospitals. I got this. A message on the psychic
paper. <br>

reminded that cuttings from the gardens are not permitted. <br>
ROSE: Very smart. Not exactly NHS. <br>
DOCTOR: No shop. I like the little shop. <br>
ROSE: I thought this far in the future, they'd have cured everything. <br>
DOCTOR: The human race moves on, but so do the viruses. It's an ongoing
war. <br>
(Rose finally notices the faces of the nursing staff in their nun-like
wimples and habits.) <br>
ROSE: They're cats. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, don't stare. Think what you look like to them, all pink

JATT: The hospital is a place of healing. <br>

JATT: The Sisters of Plentitude take a lifelong vow to help, and to
mend. <br>

CLOVIS: Excuse me! Members of the public may only gaze upon the Duke of
Manhattan with written permission from the Senate of New New York. <br>
DOCTOR: That's Petrifold Regression, right? <br>
DUKE: I'm dying, sir. A lifetime of charity and abstinence, and it ends
like this. <br>
CLOVIS: Any statements made by the Duke of Manhattan may not be made
public without official clearance. <br>
DUKE: Frau Clovis! I'm so weak. <br>
CLOVIS: Sister Jatt. A little privacy, please. <br>
JATT: He'll be up and about in no time. <br>
DOCTOR: I doubt it. Petrifold Regression? He's turning to stone. There
won't be a cure for oh, a thousand years? He might be up and about, but
only as a statue. <br>
JATT: Have faith in the Sisterhood. But is there no one here you
recognise? It's rather unusual to visit without knowing the patient. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I think I've found him. <br>

city.) <br>
JATT: Novice Hame, if I can leave this gentleman in your care? <br>

DOCTOR: We met just the once on Platform One. What's wrong with him? <br>
HAME: I'm so sorry. I thought you knew. The Face of Boe is dying. <br>
DOCTOR: Of what? <br>
HAME: Old age. The one thing we can't cure. He's thousands of years
old. Some people say millions, although that's impossible. <br>

CASSANDRA: Oh that's just Chip. He's my pet. <br>
CHIP: I worship the mistress. <br>
CASSANDRA: Moisturise me, moisturise me. <br>
(Chip sprays Cassandra.) <br>
CASSANDRA: He's not even a proper life form. He's a force grown clone.
I modelled him on my favourite pattern. But he's so faithful. Chip sees

ROSE: I hope that means food. How comes you're still alive? <br>
CASSANDRA: After you murdered me. <br>
ROSE: That was your own fault. <br>
CHIP: The brain of my mistress survived. And her pretty blue eyes were
salvaged from the bin. <br>
ROSE: What about the skin? I saw it. You, you got ripped apart. <br>
CASSANDRA: That piece of skin was taken from the front of my body. This
piece is the back. <br>

CASSANDRA: Ask not. <br>
CHIP: The mistress was lucky to survive. Chip secreted m'lady into the

ROSE: You can stop right there, Chip. <br>
CASSANDRA: But I'm so alone, hidden down here. The last Human in
existence. <br>
ROSE: Don't start that again. They've called this planet New Earth. <br>
CASSANDRA: A vegetable patch. <br>
ROSE: And there's millions of Humans out there. Millions of them. <br>
CASSANDRA: Mutant stock. <br>
ROSE: They evolved, Cassandra. They just evolved, like they should. You
stayed still. You got yourself all pickled and preserved, and what good
did it do you? <br>
CASSANDRA: Oh, I remember that night. Drinks for the Ambassador of
Thrace. That was the last time anyone told me I was beautiful. After
that it all became such hard work. <br>
ROSE: Well, you've got a knack for survival, I'll give you that. <br>
CASSANDRA: But I've not been idle, Rose, tucked away underneath this
hospital. I've been listening. The Sisters are hiding something. <br>
ROSE: What do you mean? <br>
CASSANDRA: Oh these cats have secrets. Hush, let me whisper. Come
close. <br>
ROSE: You must be joking if you think I'm coming anywhere near you. <br>

I'm company. I can hear him singing, sometimes, in my mind. Such
ancient songs. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I the only visitor? <br>
HAME: The rest of Boe-kind became extinct long ago. He's the only one
left. Legend says that the Face of Boe has watched the universe grow
old. There's all sorts of superstitions around him. One story says that
just before his death, the Face of Boe will impart his great secret,
that he will speak those words only to one like himself. <br>

young woman.) <br>
CASS-ROSE: What disease is that? <br>
DOCTOR: All of them. Every single disease in the galaxy. They've been
infected with everything. <br>
CASS-ROSE: What about us? Are we safe? <br>
DOCTOR: The air's sterile. Just don't touch them. <br>
(He closes the door.) <br>
CASS-ROSE: How many patients are there? <br>
DOCTOR: They're not patients. <br>
CASS-ROSE: But they're sick. <br>
DOCTOR: They were born sick. They're meant to be sick. They exist to be
sick. Lab rats. No wonder the Sisters have got a cure for everything.
They've built the ultimate research laboratory. A human farm. <br>
CASS-ROSE: Why don't they just die? <br>
DOCTOR: Plague carriers. The last to go. <br>
HAME: It's for the greater cause. <br>
DOCTOR: Novice Hame, When you took your vows, did you agree to this? <br>
HAME: The Sisterhood has sworn to help. <br>
DOCTOR: What, by killing? <br>
HAME: But they're not real people. They're specially grown. They have
no proper existence. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the turnover, hmm? Thousand a day? Thousand the next?
Thousand the next? How many thousands? For how many years? How many! <br>
HAME: Mankind needed us. They came to this planet with so many
illnesses. We couldn't cope. We did try. We tried everything. We tried
using clone-meat and bio-cattle, but the results were too slow, so the
Sisterhood grew its own flesh. That's all they are. Flesh. <br>
DOCTOR: These people are alive. <br>
HAME: But think of those Humans out there, healthy and happy, because
of us. <br>
DOCTOR: If they live because of this, then life is worthless. <br>
HAME: But who are you to decide that? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. And if you don't like it, if you want to take
it to a higher authority, then there isn't one. It stops with me. <br>
CASS-ROSE: Just to confirm. None of the humans in the city actually
know about this? <br>
HAME: We thought it best not. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on. I can understand the bodies. I can understand your
vows. One thing I can't understand. What have you done to Rose? <br>
HAME: I don't know what you mean. <br>
DOCTOR: And I'm being very, very calm. You want to be aware of that.
Very, very calm. And the only reason I'm being so very, very calm is
that the brain is a delicate thing. Whatever you've done to Rose's
head, I want it reversed. <br>
HAME: We haven't done anything. <br>
CASS-ROSE: I'm perfectly fine. <br>
DOCTOR: These people are dying, and Rose would care. <br>
CASS-ROSE: Oh, all right, clever clogs. Smarty pants. Lady-killer. <br>
DOCTOR: What's happened to you? <br>
CASS-ROSE: I knew something was going on in this hospital, but I needed
this body and your mind to find it out. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are you? <br>
CASS-ROSE: The last human. <br>
DOCTOR: Cassandra? <br>
CASS-ROSE: Wake up and smell the perfume. <br>
(She squirts the vial up his nose, and he passes out.) <br>
HAME: You've hurt him. I don't understand. I'll have to fetch Matron. <br>
CASS-ROSE: You do that, because I want to see her. Now, run along.
Sound the alarm! <br>
(Cassandra pulls on a power cable and sets off the alarms. Hame runs.)

They pump the patients with a top-up every ten minutes. You've got
about three minutes left. Enjoy. <br>

common, then I'll junk her with the waste. Now hushaby. It's showtime. <br>
JATT: Anything we can do to help? <br>
CASS-ROSE: Straight to the point, Whiskers. I want money. <br>
CASP: The Sisterhood is a charity. We don't give money. We only accept.
<br>
CASS-ROSE: The humans across the water pay you a fortune, and that's
exactly what I need. A one-off payment, that's all I want. Oh, and
perhaps a yacht. In return for which, I shall tell the city nothing of
your institutional murder. Is that a deal? <br>
CASP: I'm afraid not. <br>
CASS-ROSE: I'd really advise you to think about this. <br>
CASP: Oh, there's no need. I have to decline. <br>
CASS-ROSE: I'll tell them, and you've no way of stopping me. You're not
exactly Nuns with Guns. You're not even armed. <br>

comes out along with a lot of dazed, diseased people.) <br>

CASS-ROSE: Gave the system a shot of adrenaline, just to wake them up.
