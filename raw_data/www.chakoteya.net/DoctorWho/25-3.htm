A group of men in camouflage fatigues get out of a jeep and go to into
a Spanish style villa. Actually, it is at Goring by Sea, what an
appropriate name. Inside, Nazi paraphernalia and old scrolls are
scattered on a table. The Ride of the Valkyries blares out as a young
man works at a computer. He completes the data input and the screen
tells him - Landing Location Windsor Grid Ref 74W 32N November 23 1988.
Outside on a balcony a silver haired man stands next to the record
player. Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0226446/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Anton Diffring</a>, the
wonderful German actor. He picks up a modern bow to shoot a macaw in a
nearby tree, then the young man comes out.) <br>

House, Bramber, West Sussex. <br>
In the grounds, a frowning woman in black velvet draws back a long bow
while a man kneels at her feet. She misses the wood pigeon pecking at
her lawn.) <br>
RICHARD: Very good, my lady. <br>
(The woman goes back inside to where an old man is working out
calculations amid bubbling pots.) <br>
PEINFORTE: How much longer? <br>
RICHARD: He cannot hear you, my lady. Shall I <br>
PEINFORTE: Leave him. There'll be time enough to punish his
impertinence when he's finished. <br>
(Lady Peinforte takes an arrow from the fire irons.) <br>
PEINFORTE: Put this with the others. Are you so very feeble? The poison
cannot harm unless the arrow's tip should break the skin. Let who will
steal my gold. <br>
RICHARD: And the silver arrow, my lady? <br>
PEINFORTE: Leave that to me. You're sure the potion is well mixed? <br>
RICHARD: On my life, ma'am. I guarantee it. <br>
PEINFORTE: Good. We await but the calculation. Perhaps the fee will
speed matters. <br>

of her mathematician.) </font></p>

troops, who have been given small glasses of drink. They stand to
attention.) <br>
DE FLORES: Gentlemen. I wonder if even you can fully appreciate what
this moment means. You're standing now at the turning point of history.
The day of fulfillment of our mighty destiny is about to dawn. Fifty
years ago, I stood at the side of the Fuehrer himself when he ordered
the first giant step to greatness, just as now the moment approaches
for the second and final one. It will be decisive, for this time, this
time we must not fail. Gentlemen, I give you the Fourth Reich. <br>
ALL: The Fourth Reich. <br>
KARL: Herr De Flores, the aircraft is ready. <br>
DE FLORES: We leave at once. <br>

removes a silver bow, then places it in a metal carrying case. <br>
Out in space, a meteorite containing a statue starts to heat up.) </font></p>

PEINFORTE: Quickly, then. Tell me. <br>
MATHEMATICIAN: The comet Nemesis will circle the heavens once every
twenty five years. <br>
PEINFORTE: Yes. <br>
MATHEMATICIAN: It's trajectory, however, is decaying. This <br>
PEINFORTE: When will it land? <br>
MATHEMATICIAN: It will circle ever closer until finally it once again
strikes the Earth at the point from which it originally departed, the
meadow outside. <br>
PEINFORTE: When? <br>
MATHEMATICIAN: When. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. On the twenty third day
of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty eight. <br>

DOCTOR: And so we shall. <br>
(Ace picks up the Daily Mirror with the headline Meteor Approaches
England and reads the back page.) <br>
ACE: Have you seen this? Charlton picked up three points. <br>
DOCTOR: This is my favourite kind of jazz, straight blowing. <br>
(The Doctor's pocket watch beeps.) <br>
ACE: I hate people whose alarms go off during gigs. <br>
DOCTOR: What's this? It's a reminder. <br>
ACE: Well, go on, then. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, obviously, at this precise moment it's a reminder to
change course for another destination. <br>
(He closes the ornately enamelled cover of the digital device.) <br>
ACE: Where's that? <br>
DOCTOR: I've forgotten. Oh, we'll have to go back and find out. <br>
ACE: Oh, Professor. <br>
(The Doctor walks off while Ace gets Courtney to give her an
autograph.) <br>
ACE: Excuse me, would you mind signing my tape? <br>
COURTNEY: Not at all. <br>
ACE: Thanks. <br>
COURTNEY: Okay. <br>
ACE: Bye. <br>
(Ace joins the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you find it embarrassing asking for autographs? <br>
ACE: Not as embarrassing as forgetting what you set your alarm for. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I probably arranged it centuries ago. <br>
(Someone fires a silenced handgun at them from the hedge, but misses.) <br>
ACE: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Get down! <br>
(They crouch, run, and hide by some trees.) <br>
ACE: Who are they? <br>
DOCTOR: Couldn't see. Quick, the Tardis. <br>
(As they run across a wooden bridge, a volley of shots sends them
tumbling into the fast moving water. <br>
Two men with guns wearing headphones come onto the bridge to check
their handiwork. Seeing no one, they smile and leave. Then the Doctor
and Ace surface, drift downstream a little and climb out.) <br>
ACE: Hope my tape's all right. <br>

cassette player with him.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, duck. <br>
ACE: Oh, great. Now I can play my tape. <br>
DOCTOR: Afraid not. <br>
ACE: Why not? It's my tape deck. You built it for me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I know I built it for you to replace the one that was
destroyed by the Daleks, but <br>
ACE: So? It's my tape deck and I want to play this. <br>
DOCTOR: This is more than just a tape deck. And besides, we've more to
worry about than just listening to your tape. <br>
ACE: Yeah. So who were they, anyway? Who'd want to kill us? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid there's an infinite number of possibilities. What
concerns me more is my alarm. Got to find out what it was supposed to
be. <br>
ACE: Can't you remember anything about it? <br>
(He inputs some data into the tape deck.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid not. Obviously the arrangements were made in rather
a hurry. They are important. I've given them a terminal rating. <br>
ACE: Sounds nice. <br>
DOCTOR: It means that some planet somewhere faces imminent destruction.
<br>
ACE: Crikey. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite. <br>

tape deck.) <br>

PEINFORTE: When I employed you, you lead me to believe you were a
hardened criminal. <br>
RICHARD: As my lady knows, before I entered your service I was found
guilty of a large number of offences. <br>
PEINFORTE: Then have the courage of your convictions. Drink. Drink! <br>
(They both drain their goblets. There are flashing lights.) <br>
RICHARD: What's happening, my lady? <br>
PEINFORTE: We are leaving, Richard. Destiny beckons. We ride the back

Professor, but I suppose there's no time. <br>

ACE: You're amazing, Professor, being able to tell all that just from
the noise. <br>
DOCTOR: Wasn't difficult, really. It was me who launched it into space
in the first place. This may qualify as the worst miscalculation since
life crawled out of the seas on this sad planet. <br>

We await only your order. <br>
DE FLORES: Very good. Let's drive to the best hotel and refresh
ourselves. <br>
KARL: But Herr De Flores, there are only three policemen. We can take
them now. You young people, always in such a hurry. Well, we were the
same. Now, the statue is inside the meteor, which has just travelled
through space. Have you any idea how hot it will be? How can we handle
it? Since the British Government is completely unaware of its power,
I'm sure we can rely on the police force to guard it safely until we're
ready to collect it. I have every confidence in them. </font></p>

ACE: Ah. This case contained the bow of Nemesis, property of the Crown,
which disappeared mysteriously in 1788. Legend has it that unless a
place is kept for the bow in the Castle, the entire silver statue will
return to destroy the world. <br>
DOCTOR: For once legend is absolutely correct. It has just returned. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, now this. <br>

how can a statue destroy the world? <br>

ACE: Who does this house belong to, anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: A lady. <br>
ACE: She's got funny ideas about home furnishings. <br>
DOCTOR: Lady Peinforte's nothing if not original. I'm afraid this poor
man was employed for his useful rather than his ornamental qualities.
He's a scholar. He's done remarkably well. In a matter of months since
I was last here, he's calculated the exact time and date when a comet
called Nemesis will land on this planet. The twenty third of November. <br>
ACE: 1988. <br>
DOCTOR: And Lady Peinforte's rewarded him with her usual generosity. <br>
ACE: So the bow belonged to her? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, no, no. Not to her. To a statue of her. She made the
statue from the silver metal that fell out of the sky into that meadow
out there. <br>

DOCTOR: Hmm, this game is going rather badly. <br>
ACE: Professor. <br>

dies with a lot of noise.) <br>
DOCTOR: That seems to be that. Thank you. <br>
RICHARD: It was nothing, Doctor. I wish I could have saved my lady,
too, but she was one with your statue. How shall I live now, stranded,
a stranger in this time? <br>
DOCTOR: I know how you feel. However <br>
ACE: He'll give you a lift. <br>
DOCTOR: Back to 1638? <br>
RICHARD: It's possible? <br>
DOCTOR: Anything's possible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Ace are playing chess in the
garden.) <br>
ACE: So you sent the Nemesis off into space to draw the Cybermen so you
could finish them off. <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose I did. How clever of me. <br>
ACE: Just like you nailed the Daleks. <br>
DOCTOR: As I said, Ace. Unfinished business. <br>
(The Doctor tips over his king.) <br>
ACE: There's still one question you haven't answered. <br>
(Richard and a lady lute player approach.) <br>
RICHARD: We have none of this jazz whereof you speak, Doctor, but I
think you will like this. <br>
(Richard plays the flute while his companion plays the lute.) <br>
ACE: Professor? Doctor? Who are you? <br>
(The Doctor puts his finger to his lips.) </font> </p>
