rounded metal structure, half inside the top of the mountain. This area
is big, with the Captain's chair raised above the rest of the place
where crewmembers attend to various computer banks.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Mister Fibuli! Mister Fibuli! By all the x-ray storms of Vega,
where is that nincompoop? <br>
TANNOY: Calling Mister Fibuli. Mister Fibuli required on the bridge
immediately. <br>
CAPTAIN: Moons of madness, why am I encumbered with incompetents? <br>
(A bespectacled man in an olive green uniform runs in, collecting
pieces of paper from grey-suited minions on the way.) <br>
FIBULI: Captain, sir. <br>
CAPTAIN: Your report, Mister Fibuli. <br>
FIBULI: Yes, sir. I have it. <br>
CAPTAIN: Is thirty seconds late. <br>
FIBULI: Yes, sir. <br>
CAPTAIN: My qualities are many, Mister Fibuli. <br>
FIBULI: Oh, yes, sir. I <br>
CAPTAIN: But an infinite capacity for patience is not amongst them. <br>
(A metal construct appears to turn and look at Fibuli, who becomes even
more nervous and backs away.) <br>
FIBULI: I apologise most abjectly, Captain, but I do have good news,
sir. <br>
(The Captain strokes the metal object.) <br>
CAPTAIN: I hope you do. <br>
FIBULI: Well, sir, all deposits of the minerals voolium, galdrium and
assetenite four five five have now been mines, processed and stored,
sir. Good quantities of aluminas, the usual, sir. Carbon isotopes,
etcetera, etcetera. And the residue has been processed <br>
CAPTAIN: In the normal way. <br>
FIBULI: Way. Here is a list of the minerals, sir. <br>
(The metal thing is now sitting on the Captain's right shoulder, like a
parrot on a pirate.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Pah! Baubles. Baubles! Dross and baubles! We must find
vasilium. We must find madranite one five. <br>
FIBULI: Well, sir, we have located a new source. <br>
CAPTAIN: Excellent. Excellent. <br>
FIBULI: That's what caused the delay, Captain. We wanted to be
absolutely certain. It's in an unexpected sector. Here, let me show you
this chart. <br>
(The Captain glances at the chart and throws it aside.) <br>
CAPTAIN: We'll mine it. Make immediate preparations. <br>
FIBULI: Well, there is something rather curious, Captain. Here is a
detailed description of the sector. <br>
CAPTAIN: I said we'll mine it, Mister Fibuli! <br>
FIBULI: But sir <br>
CAPTAIN: Make immediate preparations now or I'll have your bones
bleached. Is that clear? <br>
FIBULI: Aye, aye, Captain. Thank you, sir. <br>
(Fibuli runs out. The Captain turns and we get our first proper view of
the cybernetically enhanced humanoid. Most of his left side has been
replaced - eye and arm at least - and he has a microphone permanently
in front of his mouth. He makes a broadcast.) <br>

people in saffron robes convenes and watches a young man in the city by
some mystic means.) <br>

CAPTAIN [OC]: Richer jewels. <br>
CITIZENS: Hooray! <br>
CAPTAIN: Finer clothes. <br>
CITIZENS: Hooray! <br>
CAPTAIN: Food in greater abundance. <br>
CITIZENS: Hooray! <br>
(The young man doesn't join in with the cheers, and quietly backs away
through the crowds.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Wealth beyond the dreams of avarice will be yours. <br>
CITIZENS: Hooray! <br>

MENTIAD: Brothers, are we agreed? <br>

the Key to Time. A job well done. <br>

K9: Correction, master. A job well done to the extent of naught point
one six six six six six <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes. The others will be easy. A piece of cake. <br>
K9: Piece of cake, master? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>

K9: Piece of cake. Radial segment of baked confection. Coefficient and
relevance to the Key of Time, zero. <br>

the fridge.) </font></p>

K9. Romana is reading a large tome which is resting on a church Eagle
lectern.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good morrow, Romana. That looks interesting. <br>
ROMANA: Good morning, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you reading? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, just familiarising myself with the technical details of
this capsule. <br>
DOCTOR: Capsule? What kind of a word is that? If you mean Tardis, why
don't you say Tardis? <br>
ROMANA: The Type Forty capsule wasn't on the main syllabus, you see. <br>
DOCTOR: Not on the syllabus. I don't know what the Academy's coming to
these days. <br>
ROMANA: Veteran and vintage vehicles was an optional extra. I preferred
something more interesting. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Like what? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, the lifecycle of the Gallifreyan flutterwing. <br>
DOCTOR: Now you're being frivolous. <br>
ROMANA: I wouldn't dream of it. <br>
(The Doctor inserts the Key tracer into its socket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no! <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: How paralysingly dull, boring and tedious. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, our next destination? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Calufrax. <br>
ROMANA: Calufrax? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Mean little planet. Still. Listen, why don't you watch
while I set the coordinate on this vintage veteran of mine? Maybe
you'll learn something. <br>
ROMANA: Right. Er, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? <br>
ROMANA: What about the synchronic feedback checking circuit? <br>
DOCTOR: What about it? <br>
ROMANA: Aren't you going to set it? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I never bother about that. Complete waste of time. <br>
ROMANA: Oh. According to the manual, it's essential. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, have you any idea how long I've been operating this
Tardis? <br>
ROMANA: Five hundred and twenty three years. <br>
DOCTOR: Right! Is it really that long? My, how time flies. <br>
ROMANA: Hasn't it. And the multiloop stabiliser? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROMANA: Multiloop stabiliser. It says here, on any capsule it will be
found impossible to effect a smooth materialisation without first
activating the multiloop stabiliser. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Absolute rubbish. <br>
(The Doctor tears that page out of the instruction tome.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, I'll show you a really smooth materialisation without a
multiloop anything. Watch this. Calufrax, here we come. <br>
(The Tardis goes shimmery.) <br>
ROMANA: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: She won't materialise. <br>
K9: Danger, master, danger. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, K9, of course. Ow! <br>
(The Doctor hits his face against the edge of the console. This was
supposed to explain Tom's split lip during the Ribos Operation when
that was filmed second, but as it was shown first it makes no sense.
Cheers, Douglas.) <br>
ROMANA: Something wrong? <br>
(The Doctor holds his hand over his mouth.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. Nothing at all. </font></p>

CAPTAIN: Imbeciles! Fools! Thrice worse than incompetent idiots! What
pernicious injury have you inflicted on my precious engines! Mister
Fibuli! <br>
FIBULI: Captain. <br>
CAPTAIN: Are you trying to scuttle this planet? <br>
FIBULI: No, sir. I've run a quick inspection, sir, and the, er, the
actual damage isn't as bad as we <br>
CAPTAIN: Do not trifle with me, Mister Fibuli. What happened? <br>
FIBULI: As far as we can tell, sir, some freak local disturbance,
probably electromagnetic. <br>
CAPTAIN: What? <br>
FIBULI: It passed very quickly. <br>
CAPTAIN: Idle prattlings, Mister Fibuli. I will know the truth! <br>
(The Captain inserts his cybernetic hand into control panel.) <br>
CAPTAIN: Oscilloscope readings. There, Mister Fibuli, there's your
local electromagnetic disturbance. What do you make of those readings? <br>
FIBULI: That's extraordinary. <br>
CAPTAIN: See? For ten seconds the entire fabric of the space time
continuum was ripped apart. Panaccenteration readings, critical
overload, every system jammed solid. Gravity dilation readings. There,
Mister Fibuli. Can you explain those figures? <br>
FIBULI: Not off the top of my head, sir. <br>
CAPTAIN: No? And why not? Because for ten seconds the whole
infrastructure of quantum physics was in retreat. Find out what
happened, Mister Fibuli, and find out fast, or by all the fires of
night, I'll have that skull off you! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Not so. I am perfectly capable of
admitting when I am wrong. <br>
ROMANA: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Only this time I wasn't. There was definitely something
out there jamming our materialisation field. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, that's what it was. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that's what it was. Yes. Whatever it was, it wasn't a
multiloop whatsit or anything else to do with that manual. <br>
ROMANA: No, of course not. May I try? <br>
DOCTOR: What, by the book? <br>
ROMANA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, all right, all right. You do it your way. <br>
ROMANA: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: You'll see. There's definitely something out there jamming our
materialisation field. <br>
ROMANA: Right. Synchronic feedback. <br>
DOCTOR: Won't make a scrap of difference. <br>
ROMANA: We'll see. Multiloop stabiliser. <br>
(The Doctor goes to crouch down by K9, hands over his ears.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look out, K9. Hold on. <br>
ROMANA: Now. <br>
(The Tardis parks herself neatly under an archway in the adobe city.) <br>
ROMANA: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
ROMANA: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: That was very, very good. Wasn't that good, K9? <br>
K9: Very, very, very good, master. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, terribly good. Listen, I think she's going to be all right.
Very all right. <br>
K9: Very, very all right. <br>
ROMANA: Shall we have a look at Calufrax now? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, all right then. Let's get it over with. Horrible place.
Cold, wet, icy. No life of any sort. Boring. <br>
(Not an accurate description of what Romana is watching on the
scanner.) <br>
ROMANA: It looks very pleasant to me. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Calufrax? You have made an enormous mistake. You've
probably, you've probably missed it by a couple of million light years!

BALATON: It is a mistake to ask too many questions. <br>
MULA: That's your answer to everything, isn't it? <br>
BALATON: I have no need for answers, for all I ask is a quiet life.

arrived at precisely the right point in space at precisely the right

DOCTOR: But to the wrong planet. <br>

freely. <br>

say, I still get very excited about it all. I know we have them rather
often now, but that's because of the Captain's great goodness, you see.
<br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. <br>
ROMANA: Just a minute. The Captain? <br>
MAN: Oh, yes. It's the Captain who does it all for us, and it really
was spectacular this time. The omens. The skies shook with lightning.
We are going to be very rich. Very, very rich. <br>
ROMANA: What, just like that? Because of lights in the sky? <br>
MAN: Oh, yes. That's the way it always happens. Here, have some
diamonds. And yes, I've got a ruby. Suit a pretty girl like you. <br>

Nice to meet you. Watch out for the Mentiads. <br>

he say anything about omens? <br>
ROMANA: Omens in the sky. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? <br>

eats the jelly babies.) <br>
GUARD: Where did you get those? <br>
MAN: Er, back there, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: I think that these stones are genuine. What do you think, K9? <br>
K9: Affirmative, master. The clear ones are the diamonds and the red
ones are the rubies. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. And what colour are the amethysts? <br>
K9: Purple, master. <br>
DOCTOR: Affirmative. <br>
(Romana is surveying the sky with the Doctor's telescope. The Doctor
spots a lot of raw gemstones lying on the ground nearby.) <br>
DOCTOR: Extraordinary. The place is littered with them. Diamonds,
Andromedan bloodstones, gravel, more diamonds. Don't they have street
sweepers here? <br>
ROMANA: Well, perhaps these stones aren't valuable here, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Diamonds and rubies not valuable? <br>
ROMANA: What's this? <br>
K9: Oolian, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: Oolian? <br>
DOCTOR: Oolian? <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
(Romana picks up a large chunk of green.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oolian? Now that is rare. That's one of the most precious
stones in the galaxy. It only occurs naturally in two places that I
know of. Qualactin and Bandraginus Five. Bandraginus Five? Where have I
heard that mentioned recently? <br>
ROMANA: It's beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, hold it up to the light. People have murdered for that
beauty, ravaged empires for it, and lying in the streets exactly where
I wasn't expecting to find it. I wonder where Calufrax got to? </font></p>

failed, so we must allow them a little rope. (Back on the main floor

ROMANA: What, from the Captain? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, he's just a terrible old bully. All that by the evil nose
of the sky demon nonsense is just bluster. <br>
DOCTOR: The Captain is a very clever and very dangerous man. He's
playing with us. He wants to find out why we've come here. <br>
ROMANA: The reason why we've come here is to find the second segment of
the key, in case you'd forgotten. Getting involved in all this <br>
(Romana has taken the tracer out of her sleeve.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is the only way to find it. What does the tracer say? <br>
ROMANA: I just don't understand it. It seems to give out a continuous
signal wherever we go. <br>
DOCTOR: What? That's it, then. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The answer. Romana, we've stumbled on one of the most heinous
crimes ever committed in this galaxy. We've got to get out of here and
get out of here quickly. Come on. <br>
(He calls up to the walkway.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ahem. Er, Captain? Your magnifactoid eccentricolometer's
definitely on the blink. <br>
CAPTAIN: You know what will happen if I even begin to suspect you of
sabotage? <br>
DOCTOR: Sabotage? Captain, it's more than my reputation's worth. <br>
CAPTAIN: Or your life? <br>
DOCTOR: Or my life, as you say. Yes, yes. We've got to go back to our
own ship now and prepare some special equipment. <br>
CAPTAIN: The girl stays here. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, we have a
special lock fitted to the Tardis door, and it requires the physical
presence of both of us to open it. That's clever, don't you think? <br>
CAPTAIN: Guards, escort them to their ship. Any attempt to escape is to
be met with instant obliteration. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a pleasure to work with you, Captain. Well, come on. Don't
just stand there, escort us. <br>

energy locked inside it. Now, with something the size of a planet,

energy. Now, some of it will be on psychic wavelengths. <br>

energy, enough to smash open the neural pathways of anyone with

CAPTAIN: Why doesn't it? Because the whole system is so perfectly
aligned by the most exquisite exercise in gravitational geometry that
every system is balanced out within itself. Which is why we can stand
next to billions of tons of super- compressed matter and not even be
aware of it. With each new planet I acquire, the forces are realigned
but the system remains stable. <br>
DOCTOR: Then it's the most brilliant piece of astro-gravitational
engineering I've ever seen. The concept is simply staggering.
Pointless, but staggering. <br>
CAPTAIN: I'm gratified that you appreciate it. <br>
DOCTOR: Appreciate it? Appreciate it? What, you commit mass destruction
and murder on a scale that's almost inconceivable and you ask me to
appreciate it? Just because you happen to have made a brilliantly
conceived toy out of the mummified remains of planets <br>
CAPTAIN: Devil storms, Doctor! It is not a toy! <br>
DOCTOR: What's it for? Huh? What are you doing? What could possibly be
worth all this? <br>

questions. You have seen, you have admired. Be satisfied and ask no
more! <br>

KIMUS: Pralix. Pralix, what's happening? Where's the Doctor? <br>

Tardis has ever attempted. Don't take it personally, old girl, just try
and survive. Now, Earth coordinates? <br>
ROMANA: Five eight zero four four, six eight four eight eight four. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Multiloop stabiliser, synchronic feedback. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, if we're going to try and materialise at exactly the
same point in time and space, how do we know when to do it? It only
happened as a fluke the first time. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a good point. Now, listen, Zanak could try to
dematerialise at any moment. We've got to be spot on. You'll man the
warp oscilloscope and the gravity dilation meter. <br>
ROMANA: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: They'll both peak when Zanak goes into demat and remat mode.
Then brace yourself. <br>
ROMANA: Right. </font></p>

anything bigger than a spanner. <br>

Omnimodular thermacron. There! Megaphoton discharge link. <br>
(The spanner floats through the room to a free standing control unit.) <br>

DOCTOR [OC]: Hit it. <br>

also the Bridge. Nu-Xanxia and the Captain are out cold.) </font></p>

again? Shall we try and materialise? <br>
ROMANA: Yeah. <br>

ROMANA: Is that her? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's her, the old harpy. <br>
ROMANA: It's a pity we can't just switch her off. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Any interference in the time dam field, though, would
trigger off an explosion that would blast us off this planet. <br>
ROMANA: Well, what do we do then? <br>
DOCTOR: I think we adapt the Captain's plan. <br>
ROMANA: The Captain's plan? </font></p>

you think? <br>
ROMANA: Incredible. A masterpiece of gravitic geometry. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, obviously. All the forces cancel each other perfectly,
otherwise Poof! <br>
ROMANA: So all that shouting and blustering was just an act to lull
Xanxia into a false sense of security while he built this. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: The Captain's plan, we must be able to use
it. <br>
ROMANA: But he'll have the controls on the Bridge. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: Wait a minute. The only way the Captain could destroy Xanxia
without blowing himself and this whole mountain to atoms would be to
get inside the perimeter of the time dams without disturbing it, right?
<br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
ROMANA: Which would require astronomic energy sources. <br>
DOCTOR: Here they are, all perfectly balanced out. <br>
ROMANA: So when he has enough of them, all he has to do is alter the
balance slightly and create a standing vortex in the middle of the time
field, so time starts up at the normal speed and the Queen dies. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
ROMANA: Brilliant! But I don't see how it helps us. <br>
DOCTOR: And it wouldn't have worked anyway. <br>
ROMANA: Why not? The theory's sound enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but Calufrax isn't. <br>
ROMANA: Calufrax? <br>
DOCTOR: Is not a normal planet. It's an artificially metricised
structure consisting of a substance with a variable atomic weight. <br>
ROMANA: So that means Calufrax, the entire planet <br>
DOCTOR: Is the second segment of the Key to Time. <br>
ROMANA: Of course. No wonder the tracer kept going mad. <br>
DOCTOR: Try it now. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The tracer. You have still got it? <br>
ROMANA: I thought you had it. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
(The Doctor searches, and finds it in his inside coat pocket.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. <br>
ROMANA: But we can't move that. We can't move anything here. If we do,
we'll just upset the whole system and create a gravity whirlpool. <br>
DOCTOR: Not if I do something immensely clever. </font></p>

NURSE: Captain, look. <br>
CAPTAIN: I shall be free from you, you hag. <br>
NURSE: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: No, Captain, don't! Don't do it! It won't work! <br>
(Nu-Xanxia uses her control box to make the Captain's cybernetic parts
go bang!) <br>
NURSE: Die, you fool! Die! And now, Doctor, it's your turn. <br>
DOCTOR: No, please, I can explain everything. <br>
NURSE: No, Doctor. Never again. <br>
(Kimus runs in and shoots her. She vanishes.) <br>
DOCTOR: No one else come in. No one else! <br>
MULA: Are they dead? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the Captain certainly is, but Xanxia's another matter.
You'd all better get out of here. This place is pretty unstable. Get
down to the foot of the mountain. <br>
KIMUS: What about you? <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, I'll follow on later. Off you go. <br>
(The Doctor takes Kimus' weapon, and the Zanakians all leave.) <br>
DOCTOR: Phew. Ah, look, this might be a bit tricky. I want you to go
and find K9, take him back to the Tardis and wait for me there. <br>
ROMANA: What about you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've got a couple of things to do here. Please go. Please
go. Go. <br>
ROMANA: All right. <br>
(Romana leaves. The Doctor goes over to the Captain's body.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Captain, let me see. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (K9 and Romana are already there when a happy
Doctor enters. Zanak is on the viewscreen looking like a narrow ring
rather than an entire planet that just happens to be hollow..) <br>
ROMANA: What did you do on the Bridge, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll never believe it. <br>
ROMANA: Try me. <br>
DOCTOR: All right, I will. I've switched the Captain's circuits around
to create a hyperspatial force shield around the shrunken planets, then
I put his dematerialisation control into remote mode. <br>
ROMANA: So we can operate them from here. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. <br>
ROMANA: But I don't see how that helps. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Well, first I dematerialise the Tardis, then I make Zanak
dematerialise for a millisecond or two, then I invert the gravity field
of the hyperspatial forceshield and drop the shrunken planets <br>
ROMANA: Into the hollow centre of Zanak! <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
ROMANA: What then? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I would have thought that was perfectly obvious. They
expand in an instant to fill a hollow space and bang. <br>
ROMANA: But what about Calufrax? How do we get hold of Calufrax? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, naturally, Calufrax is flung off into the space time
vortex and we pick it up later in the Tardis. <br>
ROMANA: Well, naturally. Oh, that's quite ingenious. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite ingenious? It's brilliant. It's fantastic! <br>
ROMANA: All right, it's fantastic. <br>
DOCTOR: Fantastic. Right. Here we go then. There. <br>
(The inside of Zanak starts to flicker.) <br>
ROMANA: Congratulations. <br>
DOCTOR: Clever, eh? <br>
ROMANA: Fantastic. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: But Doctor, haven't you forgotten something? <br>
DOCTOR: Me? <br>
ROMANA: What about the Bridge, and the time dams? <br>
DOCTOR: Bridge and time. K9? <br>
K9: Piece of cake, master. Blow them up. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, isn't that rather crude? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a bit crude, but immensely satisfying. </font></p>

playing out the last of the detonation wire.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Romana. <br>
(They attach the wire to the plunger box.) <br>
KIMUS: Doctor, when all this is over, will we really be free? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't see why not. It's entirely up to you. You've got to
make this world a better place to live in. You've got plenty of
material wealth, but there are other things. The other lead, Romana. <br>
ROMANA: I'll do it. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. (to Kimus and Mula) Now, I think this is a good
place in the universe to settle down. You've got reasonable sun, good
neighbours and some quite convenient stars for when you get round to
ordinary space travel. I think you're going to be all right here. <br>
ROMANA: Ready, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Next. (the Mentiads) What I want to know is, am I going to
blow up that Bridge, or are you? <br>
PRALIX: We will. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. I'll get out of the way while you concentrate. <br>
(With the power of their minds, the Mentiads push down the plunger on
the box and the Bridge goes KaBOOM!) <br>

do. </font> </p>
