solemn. He speaks slowly, and after initial pauses to think.) <br>
INQUISITOR: We are all aware of your feelings of sorrow, Doctor. Has
the recess given you sufficient time to overcome the distress of your
bereavement? <br>
DOCTOR: I doubt that there will ever be sufficient time for that, my
lady. <br>
VALEYARD: May we not proceed, my lady? The cavalier manner in which the
Doctor permitted his young companion to be destroyed militates against
this charade of concern. <br>
INQUISITOR: The Doctor is fighting for his life, Valeyard. However, I
do take your point. Doctor, are you ready to present your evidence? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I am grateful to you, madam, for according me the
same privilege as the Valeyard that allowed me access to the Matrix. My
excursion will be into the future. <br>
VALEYARD: The future? Is it going to be the Doctor's defence that he
improves? <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. <br>
VALEYARD: This I must see. <br>
DOCTOR: My submission concerns a crisis which threatens the lives not
only of a group of people confined together with no means of escape,
but would, if unresolved, threaten every mortal being on the planet
Earth. <br>
INQUISITOR: Proceed. <br>
DOCTOR: Mogar, a planet on the Perseus arm of the Milky Way. </font></p>

in orbit.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Rich in rare metals. A top priority consignment of these
precious metals is being loaded aboard Hyperion Three, an intergalactic
liner that ferries between Mogar and Earth. A scheduled flight in the
Earth year two thousand nine hundred and eighty six. <br>
(We travel along the side of the liner to a window that looks down into
a passenger area with rattan chairs and tables. There is a spiral
staircase from an upper level.) </font></p>

a murderer. <br>

prefer.) <br>
LASKY: Am I expected to trust my life for millions of millions of miles
to a bunch of incompetents who can't even get my luggage aboard without
losing it? <br>
JANET: Your luggage, Professor? It's not in your cabin? <br>
LASKY: Really, do I have to repeat myself? <br>
JANET: I'm sure we can sort it out. <br>

RUDGE: Problems, Janet? Let me help. <br>
LASKY: And who are you? <br>
RUDGE: Security Officer Rudge, Professor. Now, which cabin did you go
to? <br>
LASKY: You're asking, and you're the Security Officer? Cabin six, where
else? <br>
RUDGE: May I see your key, please? <br>
(Lasky hands it over.) <br>
RUDGE: Ah, no. The other way round, I think. You are in cabin nine, and
that is where you will find your luggage, Professor. <br>

LASKY: Let's hope so. <br>

a turquoise suit come up to sign in.) <br>

GRENVILLE: Thank you. <br>
RUDGE: Mister Grenville, Security Officer Rudge. If you have any
problems <br>

KIMBER: Mister Hallett, how pleasant. At least one face not belonging
to a stranger. <br>
GRENVILLE: I'm sorry, I think you must be mistaken. <br>
KIMBER: Oh, surely not. We met three years ago on Stella Stora. You
came to investigate shortages in the granary. <br>
GRENVILLE: My name is Grenville, and I've never been to Stella Stora.
You're obviously confusing me with someone else. <br>

BRUCHNER: An investigator? <br>
LASKY: Bruchner, go and check the safety measures for the Isolation
room, immediately. <br>

INQUISITOR: Relevant, I hope. <br>
VALEYARD: Completely. When, may we ask, is the Doctor going to embroil
himself in this saga? <br>
DOCTOR: Now I object. Am I not to be protected from the prosecutor's
insinuations? On what evidence does he conclude that I embroil myself? <br>
INQUISITOR: None. I shall ignore his terminology. But I do confess I
share his curiosity. <br>
DOCTOR: I fail to see why you're so curious, madam. Surely you must
know where my Tardis is? <br>
VALEYARD: Obscurity is a recognised tactic for subterfuge. <br>
DOCTOR: And posing unnecessary questions in order to score cheap points
is the tactic of a prosecutor who has no case. You have been monitoring
my Tardis. You claim it's been bugged with a listening device. So you
tell the court where my Tardis is. <br>
INQUISITOR: I require you to respond to the challenge, Valeyard. <br>

<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Let's exercise the grey cells for once, shall we, rather
than the muscles. <br>
(A guard is on the upper catwalk.) <br>
DOCTOR: That was no ordinary mayday call. It was beamed specifically at
the Tardis. <br>
MEL: So it's from someone who knows you. <br>

DOCTOR: In which case, why wasn't it signed? <br>
MEL: Panic? Desperation. Well, we won't find out by hanging about in

your head is clearer. <br>
EDWARDES: I was concentrating on the unidentified craft. <br>
RUDGE: From which you failed to get a response. <br>
TRAVERS: Mister Edwardes, what about the security tape? <br>
EDWARDES: Deactivated, sir. <br>
TRAVERS: Which indicates knowledge of our procedures. <br>

do. Report to the medic before returning to duty. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
TRAVERS: Of all the places in this infinite universe, you have to turn

Edwardes. I thought you were reporting to the medic. <br>

attacked and then you appear. <br>
MEL: And a fat lot of thanks we've got for our pains. <br>
TRAVERS: If I seem to lack gratitude, young woman <br>
DOCTOR: Melanie. Known as Mel. <br>
TRAVERS: It is because on the previous occasion that the Doctor's path
crossed mine, I found myself involved in a web of mayhem and intrigue.<br>
(This was not a televised story, however.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, saved your ship, though, Commodore. <br>
TRAVERS: Yes, you did, though whether it would have been at risk
without your intervention is another matter. <br>

call was sent. <br>
DOCTOR: Not by you, though, Commodore, so let's make this hail and
farewell, shall we? <br>
TRAVERS: Stand easy, Doctor. You're not leaving. <br>
DOCTOR: We're not? <br>
TRAVERS: I'd rather have you where I can see you than swanning around
outside. Conduct them to the lounge. Consider yourself restricted to
passenger quarters. <br>
MEL: In other words, welcome aboard. <br>
(Mel and the Doctor are escorted away, still at gunpoint.) <br>
RUDGE: Stowaways. I could have done without that on my final service
report. <br>
TRAVERS: If you're expecting an easy ride on your last voyage, Mister,
I'm afraid you're not going to get it. <br>
RUDGE: I think you're being a mite unfair, sir. <br>
TRAVERS: Am I? Well, don't be too diligent in policing the Doctor. <br>
RUDGE: Can I have clarification of that instruction, sir. <br>
TRAVERS: Give him enough rope and he will snare our culprit for us. <br>

MEL: I'm not complaining. You're really worried, aren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: I can't rid myself of the feeling I'm being used. Whoever sent
that message knew me. <br>
MEL: There's a made to measure candidate. <br>
DOCTOR: There is? <br>

DOCTOR: Intriguing possibility, but that's all. <br>

Simple, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Meanwhile? <br>

crannie and see if anyone tries to make contact. Remember, we were

spoonful of herbicide. The Vervoids must have got here first. <br>
MEL: Any more ideas, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Why can't I rid myself of the feeling we're approaching this
the wrong way round? Professor, do Vervoid chloroplasts function
normally? <br>
LASKY: A cytogeneticist now? You're a man of varied talents. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't prevaricate, Professor. <br>
LASKY: Yes, Vervoid chloroplasts trap sunlight as is normal with all
plants. <br>
MEL: Doctor, there's something out there. <br>
(Lots of Vervoids.) <br>
DOCTOR: Is there another exit? <br>
LASKY: Not this side of the hold. I'm going to talk to them. <br>
DOCTOR: They won't listen. <br>
LASKY: Perhaps they will, to me. I wasn't going to exploit them like
Doland. They'll know that. <br>
DOCTOR: They'll spare no one. <br>
LASKY: I have to try. <br>
(Mel finds an entrance to the service ducts behind the little lab.) <br>
MEL: Doctor! <br>
(Lasky walks up to the Vervoids.) <br>
LASKY: You must know who I am. <br>
VERVOID: Yes, Professor Lasky, we do. <br>
LASKY: Then you must also be aware that I mean you no harm. <br>
VERVOID: All animal-kind is our enemy, Professor. Even you. <br>

pulveriser, before another gets him in the back.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mel has lead the Doctor into the ducts, and they
have found the stash of bodies.) <br>
MEL: How could they? It's obscene. <br>
DOCTOR: Not to a Vervoid. <br>
MEL: You can't justify it. It's just <br>
DOCTOR: It's a matter of perspective, Mel. In your house in Pease
Pottage, you had a large garden. What did you do with the plants and
weeds you uprooted? <br>
MEL: Put them on a compost heap. <br>
DOCTOR: They're obeying instinct, like migrating birds or salmon
swimming relentlessly upstream to spawn even though they may die. A
compulsive following of the life cycle. Come on, Mel. </font></p>

DOCTOR: We need your help, Commodore. <br>
TRAVERS: Name it. <br>
DOCTOR: Like the Vervoids, we're being driven by blind instinct. Kill
or be killed. <br>
TRAVERS: We've been over that. <br>
DOCTOR: What if instead of bringing their lives to an abrupt end we did
the opposite, accelerated the Vervoid life cycle? <br>
TRAVERS: How the blazes do we do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Vionesium. <br>
MEL: Vionesium? <br>
DOCTOR: A rare metal found on the airless planet of Mogar. <br>
TRAVERS: And worth a prince's ransom. <br>
DOCTOR: Or a hijack. <br>
MEL: You mean there's a consignment on board? <br>
TRAVERS: That's right, in the vault. <br>
MEL: But how will this vionesium accelerate the Vervoid life cycle? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a substance similar to magnesium. Exposed to oxygenated
air, it releases incredibly intense light and carbon dioxide. Spring,
summer, autumn, all condensed into a few moments. <br>
TRAVERS: Seasons which I may be a long time enjoying again if I go
robbing my own vault. <br>
MEL: Seasons you can forget if you don't. We've seen what these
creatures can do. <br>
DOCTOR: You've no alternative, Commodore. <br>
MEL: You can't send for outside help, the ship's completely cut off.
The Doctor's the only hope you've got. <br>
TRAVERS: All right, Doctor, you can have the vionesium. What's the
drill? <br>
DOCTOR: First, you must drive the Vervoids back to their lair. <br>
TRAVERS: Me? <br>
DOCTOR: Plunge the ship into darkness. </font></p>

the Vervoids turn on her.) <br>
MEL: No! <br>

light fireball. The others throw their globes and the Doctor pulls Mel
clear of the disorientated Vervoids, who begin to go brown and
collapse, wailing in the autumn of their lives. Soon there is nothing

make this the sweet sorrow of a final parting, hmm? <br>
MEL: I shall remember that the next time we get a mayday call. <br>
DOCTOR: She means that, too. Memory like an elephant. <br>
MEL: That's his idea of a compliment, comparing me to an elephant. <br>
DOCTOR: But so ludicrously appropriate, I find it amusing. <br>
MEL: Well, at least if you're laughing you can't be singing. Have you
ever heard his rendering of On With The Motley? Count your blessings.
Bye. <br>

sound of the Doctor singing.) <br>

survive, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No, my lady. Had even a leaf survived and fallen on fertile
soil, a Vervoid would have grown. <br>
VALEYARD: Every Vervoid was destroyed by your ingenious plan. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
VALEYARD: Whether or not the Doctor has proved himself innocent of
meddling is no longer the cardinal issue before this court. He has
proved himself guilty of a far greater crime. <br>
INQUISITOR: You refer to Article seven of Gallifreyan law? <br>
DOCTOR: No, my lady, that cannot apply! Had a single Vervoid reached
Earth, the human race would have been eliminated! <br>
VALEYARD: Article seven permits no exceptions. The Doctor has destroyed
a complete species. The charge must now be genocide. </font></p>
