getting even more new arrivals. <br>

suite.) <br>
CLEAVER: I've checked the figures. I've checked them again and again.
Always the same result. The design is not safe. It could result in the
death of millions. I beg of you, stop the project right now, before
it's too late. <br>
MARGARET: Well, goodness me. Obviously, Mister Cleaver, you're the
expert. <br>
CLEAVER: Then you'll stop it? <br>
MARGARET: It seems I have no choice. (gurgle) Oh, do excuse me. Civic
duties leave little time for a sandwich. <br>
CLEAVER: But you promise you'll stop it, today? <br>
MARGARET: Well, of course. Nothing is more important than human life.
What do you take me for, some sort of maniac? <br>
CLEAVER: Why, no. <br>
MARGARET: Am I right in thinking you've shown your results only to me? <br>
CLEAVER: Just to you. No one else. <br>
MARGARET: Wise move. <br>
(Cleaver turns away and wipes his brow.) <br>
CLEAVER: I can't tell you, Mrs Blaine. This is such a weight off my
mind. I've barely slept. I couldn't believe my own readings. The scale
of it. Destruction like the British Isles has never seen before. If I
didn't know better, I'd almost think that someone wanted this project
to go wrong. As though they intended to wipe this city off the map.
Thank goodness we've got you, our esteemed leader. <br>

and heads to the redeveloped Oval Basin. The Tardis is in front of the
huge water tower, a very avante garde slab with water pouring down it.
Mickey knocks on the door. Jack answers it.) <br>
JACK: Who the hell are you? <br>
MICKEY: What do you mean, who the hell am I? Who the hell are you? <br>
JACK: Captain Jack Harkness. Whatever your selling, we're not buying. <br>

DOCTOR: Here comes trouble! How're you doing, Ricky boy? <br>
MICKEY: It's Mickey! <br>
ROSE: Don't listen to him, he's winding you up. <br>
MICKEY: You look fantastic. <br>
(Rose and Mickey hug. The Doctor is up a ladder mending something.) <br>
JACK: Aw, sweet, look at these two. How come I never get any of that? <br>
DOCTOR: Buy me a drink first. <br>
JACK: You're such hard work. <br>
DOCTOR: But worth it. <br>
ROSE: Did you manage to find it? <br>
MICKEY: There you go. <br>
(Mickey hands over Rose's passport.) <br>
ROSE: I can go anywhere now. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you, you don't need a passport. <br>
ROSE: It's all very well going to Platform One and Justicia and the
Glass Pyramid of San Kaloon, but what if we end up in Brazil? I might
need it. You see, I'm prepared for anything. <br>
MICKEY: Sounds like your staying, then. So, what're you doing in
Cardiff? And who the hell's Jumping Jack Flash? I mean, I don't mind
you hanging out with big-ears up there <br>
DOCTOR: Oi! <br>
MICKEY: Look in the mirror. But this guy, I don't know, he's kind of <br>
JACK: Handsome? <br>
MICKEY: More like cheesy. <br>
JACK: Early twenty first Century slang. Is cheesy good or bad? <br>
MICKEY: It's bad. <br>
JACK: But bad means good, isn't that right? <br>
DOCTOR: Are you saying I'm not handsome? <br>
ROSE: We just stopped off. We need to refuel. The thing is, Cardiff's
got this rift running through the middle of the city. It's invisible,
but it's like an earthquake fault between different dimensions. <br>
DOCTOR: The rift was healed back in 1869. <br>
ROSE: Thanks to a girl named Gwyneth, because these creatures called
the Gelth, they were using the rift as a gateway but she saved the
world and closed it. <br>
JACK: But closing a rift always leaves a scar, and that scar generates
energy, harmless to the human race <br>
DOCTOR: But perfect for the Tardis, so just park it here for a couple
of days right on top of the scar and <br>
JACK: Open up the engines, soak up the radiation. <br>
ROSE: Like filling her up with petrol and off we go! <br>
JACK: Into time! <br>

which means we've got time to kill. <br>
MICKEY: That old lady's staring. <br>
JACK: Probably wondering what four people could do inside a small
wooden box. <br>
MICKEY: What are you captain of, the Innuendo Squad? <br>
(Jack makes a gesture and starts to walk away.) <br>
MICKEY: Wait, the Tardis, we can't just leave it. Doesn't it get
noticed? <br>
JACK: Yeah, what's with the police box? Why does it look like that? <br>
ROSE: It's a cloaking device. <br>
DOCTOR: It's called a chameleon circuit. The Tardis is meant to
disguise itself wherever it lands, like if this was Ancient Rome, it'd
be a statue on a plinth or something. But I landed in the 1960s, it
disguised itself as a police box, and the circuit got stuck. <br>
MICKEY: So it copied a real thing? There actually was police boxes? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, on street corners. Phone for help before they had radios
and mobiles. If they arrested someone, they could shove them inside
till help came, like a little prison cell. <br>
JACK: Why don't you just fix the circuit? <br>
DOCTOR: I like it, don't you? <br>
ROSE: I love it. <br>
MICKEY: But that's what I meant. There's no police boxes anymore, so
doesn't it get noticed? <br>
DOCTOR: Ricky, let me tell you something about the human race. You put
a mysterious blue box slap bang in the middle of town, what do they do?
Walk past it. Now, stop your nagging. Let's go and explore. <br>
ROSE: What's the plan? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Cardiff, early twenty first century and the
wind's coming from the east. Trust me. Safest place in the universe. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Mayor Margaret Blaine is making an announcement,
with the scale model of the power station centre stage. The banner
above her reads - The Blaidd Drwg Project.) <br>
MARGARET: This nuclear power station right in the heart of Cardiff city
will bring jobs for all. As you can see, as Lord Mayor, I've had to
sanction some radical redevelopments. No photographs! What did I say?
Take pictures of the project by all means, but not me, thank you. So,
Cardiff Castle will be demolished allowing the Blaidd Drwg Project to
rise up, tall and proud. A monument to Welsh industry. And yes, some of
you might shiver. The words nuclear power station and major population
centre aren't exactly the happiest of bedfellows. But I give you my
personal guarantee that as long as I walk upon this Earth, no harm will
come to any of my citizens. Now, drink up. A toast. To the future! <br>
ALL: To the future! <br>
MARGARET: And believe me it will glow. <br>
CATHY: Excuse me, Mrs Blaine? My name's Cathy Salt, I represent the
Cardiff Gazette. <br>
MARGARET: I'm sorry, I'm not doing interviews. I can't bear self
publicity. <br>
CATHY: But are you aware of the curse? <br>
MARGARET: Whatever do you mean? Cathy, wasn't it? <br>
CATHY: Cathy Salt. That's what some of your engineers are saying, that
the Blaidd Drwg Project is cursed. <br>
MARGARET: Sounds rather silly to me. <br>
CATHY: That's what I thought. I was just chasing a bit of local colour.
But the funny thing is, when you start piecing it all together, it does
begin to look a bit odd. <br>
MARGARET: In what way? <br>
CATHY: The deaths, The number of deaths associated with this project.
First of all, there was the entire team of the European Safety
Inspectors. <br>
MARGARET: But they were French! Its not my fault if Danger Explosives
was only written in Welsh. <br>
CATHY: And then there was that accident with the Cardiff Heritage
Committee. <br>
MARGARET: The electrocution of that swimming pool was put down to
natural wear and tear. <br>
CATHY: And then the architect? <br>
MARGARET: It was raining, visibility was low. my car simply couldn't
stop. <br>
CATHY: And then just recently, Mister Cleaver, the government's nuclear
adviser. <br>
MARGARET: Slipped on an icy patch. <br>
CATHY: He was decapitated. <br>
MARGARET: It was a very icy patch. I'm afraid these stories are nothing
more than typical small town thinking. I really haven't got time. If
you'll excuse me. <br>
CATHY: Except, before he died, Mister Cleaver posted some of his
findings online. <br>
MARGARET: Did he now? <br>
CATHY: If you know where to look. He was concerned about the reactor. <br>
MARGARET: Oh, all that technical stuff! <br>
CATHY: Specifically, that the design of the suppression pool would
cause the hydrogen recombiners to fail, precipitating in the collapse
in the containment isolation system and resulting in a meltdown. <br>
MARGARET: Who's been doing her homework? <br>
CATHY: That's my job. <br>
MARGARET: I think, Cathy Salt, I think you and I should have a word in
private. </font></p>

theories of yours? <br>
(Margaret dashes into a cubicle. There are squelchy sounds.) <br>
CATHY: Sounds like we got here just in time. <br>
MARGARET: Continue. <br>
CATHY: Well, I don't know much about nuclear physics, but from what I
could make out, Cleaver was saying that the whole project could go up
worse than Chernobyl. <br>
(Margaret unzips her forehead. Cathy notices the light under the door.)
<br>
CATHY: Is there something wrong with the lights? <br>
MARGARET: Oh, they're always on the blink. I can't tell you how many
memos I've sent. So, Chernobyl. <br>
CATHY: Apparently, but a thousand times worse. I know it sounds absurd,
there must be so many safety regulations. But Cleaver seemed to be
talking about a nuclear holocaust. He almost made it sound deliberate.
I mean, we're hardly the Sunday Times, we're only the Cardiff Gazette,
but we still have a duty to report the facts. <br>
MARGARET: And you're going to print this information? <br>
CATHY: Are you all right? You sound a bit. <br>
MARGARET: Sore throat. Ahem, ahem. Just a little tickle. But tell me,
do you intend to make this information public? <br>
CATHY: I have to. <br>
MARGARET: So be it. <br>
CATHY: Mind you, my boyfriend thinks I'm mad. We're getting married
next month, and he says if I cause a fuss, I could lose my job just
when we need the money. <br>
MARGARET: Boyfriend? <br>
CATHY: Jeffery. Civil Servant. He's nothing exciting, but he's mine. <br>
MARGARET: When's the wedding? <br>
CATHY: The nineteenth. It's really just to stop my mother from nagging,
but the baby sort of clinched it, I suppose. <br>
MARGARET: You're with child? <br>
(Margaret sits on the toilet.) <br>
CATHY: Three months. It's not showing yet. Wasn't planned, it was an
accident. Nice accident, though. <br>
MARGARET: Congratulations. <br>
CATHY: Thank you. How about you? You got any kids? <br>
MARGARET: No. <br>
CATHY: Is there a Mister Blaine? <br>
MARGARET: Not anymore. I'm all on my own. I had quite a sizeable
family, once upon a time. Wonderful brothers. Oh, they were bold. But
all of them gone now. Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm cursed. <br>
CATHY: No, no, I don't think so. Not really. <br>
MARGARET: You're very kind. If you don't mind, I might be a while. You
run along. Perhaps we could do this another day. <br>
CATHY: Are you all right? <br>
MARGARET: Fine! <br>
CATHY: Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll leave my details with your
office. Thanks for talking. <br>

reads it.) <br>
JACK: No, I just picked him up went right for the ship, full throttle.
Didn't stop until I hit the spacelanes. I was shaking. It was
unbelievable. It freaked me out, and by the time I got fifteen light

you're trapped. Your family get killed but you teleport out just in the
nick of time. You have no means of escape. What do you do? You build a

MARGARET: A philanthropic gesture. I've learnt the error of my ways. <br>
DOCTOR: And it just so happens to be right on top of the rift. <br>
MARGARET: What rift would that be? <br>
JACK: A rift in space and time. If this power station went into
meltdown, the entire planet would go (suck boom)! <br>
DOCTOR: This station is designed to explode the minute it reaches
capacity. <br>
ROSE: Didn't anyone notice? Isn't there someone in London checking this
sort of stuff? <br>
MARGARET: We're in Cardiff. London doesn't care. The South Wales coast
could fall into the sea and they wouldn't notice. Oh. I sound like a
Welshman. God help me, I've gone native. <br>

end up killing herself. <br>

MICKEY: I bet she stole it. <br>
MARGARET: It fell into my hands. <br>
ROSE: Is it a weapon? <br>
JACK: It's transport. You see, if the reactor blows, the rift opens.
Phenomenal cosmic disaster. But this thing shrouds you in a forcefield.
You have this energy bubble, so you're safe. Then you feed it
coordinates, stand on top, and ride the concussion all the way out of
the solar system. <br>
MICKEY: It's a surfboard. <br>
JACK: A pan-dimensional surfboard, yeah. <br>
MARGARET: And it would've worked. Id have surfed away from this dead

DOCTOR: Nah, just a coincidence. Like hearing a word on the radio then
hearing it all day. Never mind. Things to do. Margaret, we're going to
take you home. <br>

ROSE: Raxacorico <br>
DOCTOR: fallapatorius. <br>
ROSE: Raxacoricofallapatorius. That's it! I did it! <br>
MARGARET: They have the death penalty. The family Slitheen was tried in
its absence many years ago and found guilty with no chance of appeal.
According to the statutes of government, the moment I return, I am to
be executed. What do you make of that, Doctor? Take me home and you

pizza or something. Just you and me. <br>
ROSE: That'd be nice. <br>
MICKEY: And, I mean, if the Tardis can't leave until morning, we could
go to a hotel, spend the night. I mean, if you want to. I've got some
money. <br>
ROSE: Okay, yeah. <br>
MICKEY: Is that all right? <br>
ROSE: Yeah. <br>
MICKEY: Cool. There's a couple of bars around here. We should give them
a go. Do you have to go and tell him? <br>
ROSE: It's none of his business. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor watches Mickey and Rose on the
scanner.) <br>
JACK: So, what's on? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing, just. <br>
MARGARET: I gather it's not always like this, having to wait. I bet
you're always the first to leave, Doctor. Never mind the consequences,
off you go. You butchered my family and then ran for the stars, am I
right? But not this time. At last you have consequences. How does it
feel? <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't butcher them. <br>
JACK: Don't answer back. That's what she wants. <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't. What about you? You had an emergency teleport. You
didn't zap them to safety, did you? <br>
MARGARET: It only carries one. I had to fly without coordinates. I
ended up on a skip in the Isle of Dogs. It wasn't funny. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. It is a bit funny. <br>
MARGARET: Do I get a last request? <br>
DOCTOR: Depends what it is. <br>
MARGARET: I grew quite fond of my little human life. All those rituals.
The brushing of the teeth, and the complicated way they cook things.
There's a little restaurant just round the Bay. It became quite a
favourite of mine. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that what you want, a last meal? <br>
MARGARET: Don't I have rights? <br>
JACK: Oh, like she's not going to try to escape. <br>
MARGARET: Except I can never escape the Doctor, so where's the danger?
I wonder if you could do it? To sit with a creature you're about to
kill and take supper. How strong is your stomach? <br>
DOCTOR: Strong enough. <br>
MARGARET: I wonder. I've seen you fight your enemies, now dine with
them. <br>
DOCTOR: You won't change my mind. <br>
MARGARET: Prove it. <br>
DOCTOR: There are people out there. If you slip away just for one
second, they'll be in danger. <br>
JACK: Except I've got these. <br>
(Jack holds up two bangles.) <br>
JACK: You both wear one. If she moves more than ten feet away, she gets
zapped by ten thousand volts. <br>
DOCTOR: Margaret, would you like to come out to dinner? My treat. <br>
MARGARET: Dinner in bondage. Works for me. <br>
(And so Jack is left to carry on mending the Tardis whilst the two
couples go out for their dinners.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARGARET: Here we are, out on a date, and you
haven't even asked my proper name. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not a date. What's your name? <br>
MARGARET: Blon. I am Blon Fel Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen. That's what
it'll say on my death certificate. <br>
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Blon. <br>
MARGARET: I'm sure. Look, that's where I was living as Margaret. Nice
little flat, over there, on the top. Next to the one with the light on.
<br>
(The Doctor turns to look and she puts some powder from her ring into
the his wine.) <br>
MARGARET: Two bedrooms, bayside view. I was rather content. Don't
suppose I'll see it again. <br>
(The Doctor swaps the glasses over.) <br>
DOCTOR: Suppose not. <br>
MARGARET: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Pleasure. <br>
MARGARET: Tell me then, Doctor. What do you know of our species? <br>
DOCTOR: Only what I've seen. <br>
MARGARET: Did you know, for example, in extreme cases, when her life is
in danger, a female Raxacoricofallapatorian can manufacture a poison
dart within her own finger. <br>
(She points. The dart flies and the Doctor catches it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I did. <br>
MARGARET: Just checking. And one more thing. between you and me. <br>
(They look around then lean forward so Margaret can whisper.) <br>
MARGARET: As a final resort, the excess poison can be exhaled through
the lungs. <br>
(Margaret starts to exhale. The Doctor uses a breath freshener on her.)
<br>
DOCTOR: That's better. Now then, what do you think? Mmm, steak looks
nice. Steak and chips. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: The Doctor took me to this planet a while
back. It was much colder than this. They called it Woman Wept. The
planet was actually called Woman Wept, because if you looked at it,
right, from above, there's like this huge continent, like all curved
round. It sort of looked like a woman, you know, lamenting. Oh my God,
and we went to this beach, right. No people, no buildings, just this
beach like a thousand miles across. And something had happened,
something to do with the sun, I don't know, but the sea had just
frozen. In a split second, in the middle of a storm, right, waves and
foam, just frozen, all the way out to the horizon. Midnight, right, we
walk underneath these waves a hundred feet tall, made of ice. <br>
MICKEY: I'm going out with Trisha Delaney. <br>
ROSE: Right. That's nice. Trisha from the shop? <br>
MICKEY: Yeah, Rob Delany's sister. <br>
ROSE: Well, she's nice. She's a bit big. <br>
MICKEY: She lost weight. You've been away. <br>
ROSE: Well, good for you. She's nice. <br>
MICKEY: So, tell us more about this planet, then. <br>
ROSE: That was it, really.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARGARET: Public execution's a slow death. They
prepare a thin acetic acid, lower me into the cauldron and boil me. The
acidity is perfectly gauged to strip away the skin. Internal organs
fall out into the liquid, and I become soup. And still alive, still
screaming. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't make the law. <br>
MARGARET: But you deliver it. Will you stay to watch? <br>
DOCTOR: What else can I do? <br>
MARGARET: The Slitheen family's huge. There's a lot more of us, all
scattered off-world. Take me to them. Take me somewhere safe. <br>
DOCTOR: But then you'll just start again. <br>
MARGARET: I promise I won't. <br>
DOCTOR: You've been in that skin suit too long. You've forgotten. There
used to be a real Margaret Blaine. You killed her and stripped her and
used the skin. You're pleading for mercy out of a dead woman's lips. <br>
MARGARET: Perhaps I have got used to it. A human life, an ordinary
life. That's all I'm asking. Give me a chance, Doctor. I can change. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't believe you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MICKEY: So, what do you want to do now? <br>
ROSE: Don't mind. <br>
MICKEY: We could ask about hotels. <br>
ROSE: What would Trisha Delaney say? <br>
MICKEY: Suppose. There's a bar down there with a Spanish name or
something <br>
ROSE: You don't even like Trisha Delaney! <br>
MICKEY: Oh, is that right? What the hell do you know? <br>
ROSE: I know you, And I know her. And I know that's never going to
happen. So who do you think you're kidding? <br>
MICKEY: At least I know where she is! <br>
ROSE: There we are, then. It's got nothing to do with Trisha. This is
all about me, isn't it <br>
MICKEY: You left me! We were nice, we were happy. And then what? You
give me a kiss and you run off with him, and you make me feel like
nothing, Rose. I was nothing. I can't even go out with a stupid girl
from a shop because you pick up the phone and I comes running. I mean,
is that what I am, Rose, standby? Am I just supposed to sit here for
the rest of my life, waiting for you? Because I will. <br>
ROSE: I'm sorry. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bistro 10]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARGARET: I promise you I've changed since we last
met, Doctor. There was this girl, just today. A young thing, something
of a danger. She was getting too close. I felt the blood lust rising,
just as the family taught me, I was going to kill her without a
thought. And then I stopped. She's alive somewhere right now. She's
walking around this city because I can change. I did change. I know I
can't prove it <br>
DOCTOR: I believe you. <br>
MARGARET: Then you know I'm capable of better. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't mean anything. <br>
MARGARET: I spared her life. <br>
DOCTOR: You let one of them go, but that's nothing new. Every now and
then, a little victim's spared because she smiled, because he's got
freckles, because they begged. And that's how you live with yourself.
That's how you slaughter millions. Because once in a while, on a whim,
if the wind's in the right direction, you happen to be kind. <br>
MARGARET: Only a killer would know that. Is that right? From what I've
seen, your funny little happy go lucky little life leaves devastation
in its wake. Always moving on because you dare not look back. Playing
with so many peoples lives, you might as well be a god. And you're
right, Doctor. You're absolutely right. Sometimes you let one go. Let
me go.

know that's not fair. But I just need something, yeah? Some sort of
promise that when you do come back, you're coming back for me. <br>

I was made to carry out my first kill at thirteen. If I'd refused, my
father would have fed me to the Venom Grubs. If I'm a killer, it's
because I was born to kill. It's all I know. Doctor, are you even
listening to me? <br>
DOCTOR: Can you hear that? <br>
MARGARET: I'm begging for my life. <br>

(Energy is streaming from the Tardis into the sky.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's the rift. The rift's opening! </font></p>

plaza.) <br>
DOCTOR: What the hell are you doing?? <br>
JACK: It just went crazy! <br>
DOCTOR: It's the rift. Time and space are ripping apart. The whole
city's going to
disappear! <br>
(Bang! Rose runs into the plaza and sees what is happening.) <br>
JACK: It's the extrapolator. I've disconnected it but it's still
feeding off the engine! It's using the Tardis. I can't stop it! <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind Cardiff, it's going to rip open the planet. <br>
(Rose enters.) <br>
ROSE: What is it? What's happening?! <br>
MARGARET: Oh, just little me. <br>
(Margaret takes an arm out of her body suit and grabs Rose.) <br>
MARGARET: One wrong move and she snaps like a promise. <br>
DOCTOR: I might've known. <br>
MARGARET: I've had you bleating all night, poor baby, now shut it. You,
fly boy, put the extrapolator at my feet. <br>
(Margaret tightens her grip on Rose's neck. The Doctor nods and Jack
obeys.) <br>
MARGARET: Thank you. Just as I planned. <br>
ROSE: I thought you needed to blow up the nuclear power station. <br>
MARGARET: Failing that, if I were to be arrested, then anyone capable
of tracking me down would have considerable technology of their own.
Therefore, they would be captivated by the extrapolator. Especially a
magpie mind like yours, Doctor. So the extrapolator was programmed to
go to
plan B. To lock onto the nearest alien power source and open the rift.
And what a power source it found. I'm back on schedule, thanks to you. <br>
JACK: The rift's going to convulse. You'll destroy the whole planet. <br>
MARGARET: And you with it! <br>
(Margaret stands on the extrapolator.) <br>
MARGARET: While I ride this board over the crest of the inferno all the
way to freedom. Stand back, boys. Surf's up. <br>
(The Tardis console cracks open and bright light hits Margaret.) <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, opening the rift means you'll pull this ship apart. <br>
MARGARET: So sue me. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not just any old power source. It's the Tardis. My Tardis.
The best ship in the universe. <br>
MARGARET: It'll make wonderful scrap. <br>
ROSE: What's that light? <br>
DOCTOR: The heart of the Tardis. This ship's alive. You've opened its
soul. <br>
MARGARET: It's so bright. <br>
DOCTOR: Look at it, Margaret. <br>
MARGARET: Beautiful. <br>
DOCTOR: Look inside, Blon Fel Fotch. Look at the light. <br>
(Margaret relaxes and Rose gets free. Then she looks up at the Doctor,
smiling.) <br>
MARGARET: Thank you. <br>
(Margaret disappears into the light. The empty bodysuit crumples onto
the extrapolator.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't look. Stay there. Close your eyes! <br>
(The Doctor closes the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Jack, come on, shut it all down. Shut down! Rose, that
panel over there, turn all the switches to the right. <br>
(Energy stops pouring into the sky.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nicely done. Thank you, all. <br>
ROSE: What happened to Margaret? <br>
JACK: Must've got burnt up. Carried out her own death sentence. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don't think she's dead. <br>
ROSE: Then where'd she go? <br>
DOCTOR: She looked into the heart of the Tardis. Even I don't know how
strong that is. And the ship's telepathic, like I told you, Rose. Gets
inside your head. Translates alien languages. Maybe the raw energy can
translate all sorts of thoughts. <br>
(The Doctor finds a large egg with dreadlocks on the top inside the
bodysuit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Here she is. <br>
ROSE: She's an egg? <br>
DOCTOR: Regressed to her childhood. <br>
JACK: She's an egg? <br>
DOCTOR: She can start again. Live her life from scratch. If we take her
home, give her to a different family, tell them to bring her up
properly, she might be all right! <br>
JACK: Or she might be worse. <br>
DOCTOR: That's her choice. <br>
ROSE: She's an egg. <br>
DOCTOR: She's an egg. <br>
ROSE: Oh, my God. Mickey. <br>
(Rose runs out and across the cracked plaza, back to Mermaid Quay where
ambulances are taking away the injured. Mickey is watching from the
shadows as she goes up to a paramedic and asks a question. Mickey walks
away. She returns to the Tardis alone.) <br>
DOCTOR: We're all powered up. We can leave. Opening the rift filled us
up with energy. We can go, if that's all right. <br>
ROSE: Yeah, fine. <br>
DOCTOR: How's Mickey? <br>
ROSE: He's okay. He's gone. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you want to go and find him? We'll wait. <br>
ROSE: No need. He deserves better. <br>
DOCTOR: Off we go, then. Always moving on <br>
JACK: Next stop, Raxacoricofallapatorius. Now you don't often get to
say that. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll just stop by and pop her in the hatchery. Margaret the
Slitheen can live her life again. A second chance. <br>
ROSE: That'd be nice.</font> </p>
