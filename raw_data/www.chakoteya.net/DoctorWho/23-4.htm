<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (An imposing figure enters the courtroom and bows
to the Inquisitor.) <br>
KEEPER: I came as soon as I could, my lady. <br>
INQUISITOR: Thank you, Keeper. Doctor, do you have any further evidence
in your defence? <br>
VALEYARD: My lady, with all due respect, have we not seen enough? Are
you not forgetting Article seven and the irrefutable charge which faces
the Doctor, that of genocide? <br>
INQUISITOR: I shall deal with that charge in due course, Valeyard. Now
kindly don't interrupt me again. Doctor, do you have any further
evidence in your defence? <br>
DOCTOR: No, my lady, but I would point out that much of the Railyard's
so-called evidence was a farrago of distortion which would have had
Ananias, Baron Munchhausen and every other famous liar blushing down to
their very toe nails. Much of the evidence was not as I remembered. <br>
INQUISITOR: Do you still maintain the Matrix has been tampered with? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, madam, I do. All I do not yet understand is who did it and
why. <br>
INQUISITOR: Your accusation would be laughable if it were not so
outrageous. However, as you see, I have summoned the Keeper of the
Matrix. Keeper? <br>
KEEPER: My lady. <br>
INQUISITOR: You have heard the Doctor's allegations. Is it at all
possible for the data stored within the Matrix to be tampered with in
any way? <br>
KEEPER: Quite impossible, my lady. No one may enter the Matrix without
the Key of Rassilon. <br>
(The Keeper indicates a large old-fashioned key fastened to his collar
of office. <br>
DOCTOR: And by whom may the key be used? <br>
KEEPER: Qualified people, for inspection once in a millennium, perhaps.
To replace a transductor. <br>
DOCTOR: But keys can be copied, you'll agree? <br>
KEEPER: The Key of Rassilon never leaves my possession. <br>
DOCTOR: Except when it's in the hands of those qualified people. <br>
VALEYARD: This is a ridiculous allegation, my lady. The Doctor is
challenging the evidence of the Matrix on the grounds that it has been
tampered with, a charge he is totally unable to substantiate. <br>
INQUISITOR: That is accepted. Doctor, wild accusations of malfeasance
do not constitute a defence. <br>
DOCTOR: The Matrix can be physically penetrated. The Keeper has
admitted as much. Now, much of the evidence you saw was totally at
variance with my own memory. Therefore, it has been deliberately
distorted. <br>
INQUISITOR: And who would do such a thing, even if it were possible. <br>
DOCTOR: Somebody who wants my head, such as the Valeyard. <br>
<i> (The Valeyard laughs.) <br>
INQUISITOR: Doctor, if you were not already facing the most serious
charges, such an accusation levelled at a senior prosecutor would bring
you into contempt. </i> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Meanwhile, two small spacepods are brought onto
the space station in the same way that the Tardis was. The first opens
to reveal Sabalom Glitz. The second contains an angry woman banging on
the lid.) <br>
MEL [OC]: What's going on? Let me out of here! <br>
GLITZ: Dibber? What's happened to your voice, lad? <br>
(Glitz opens the second pod.) <br>
MEL: I'm not Dibber. Neither am I a lad. And what's more, there's
nothing wrong with my voice. As a matter of total disinterest, who are
you? <br>
GLITZ: Oh, Sabalom Glitz. And you? <br>
MEL: Melanie, known as Mel. <br>
GLITZ: Are they all like you here? <br>
MEL: I don't know. Shall we go and find out? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Trial room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> INQUISITOR: There is only one to rebut the
evidence of the Matrix, Doctor, and that is to produce witnesses who
can support your version of events. Can you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course I can't. You know I can't. <br>
INQUISITOR: Then we must accept the Valeyard's evidence. <br>
DOCTOR: Any witnesses I might produce are scattered all over the
universe and all through time. How can I find them now? <br>
VALEYARD: Procrastination, my lady. The Doctor' only <br>
(The Valeyard stares as Mel and Glitz enter the courtroom.) <br>
DOCTOR: Melanie? Glitz? What are you doing here? <br>
GLITZ: I was sent, wasn't I. Not my idea, mind. <br>
MEL: Same here. What have you been up to? <br>
INQUISITOR: Be silent. Who sent you? <br>
GLITZ: That's the beak, is it? They all look the same, don't they?
Carved out of something hard and nasty. <br>
INQUISITOR: You said you were sent here, Sabalom Glitz. By whom? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: By me, madam. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no! Now I really am finished. <br>
MEL: Who's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Just one of my oldest enemies. <br>
INQUISITOR: This is entirely irregular. Who are you, sir? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: I'm known as the Master, and as you see, I speak to
you from within the Matrix. Proof, if any be needed, that not only
qualified people can enter here. <br>
KEEPER: But you haven't the Key of Rassilon. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: I got a very good copy, Keeper, just as the Doctor
said was possible. <br>
INQUISITOR: This is an independent inquiry appointed by the High
Council to investigate serious charges <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Madam, I know. I've followed the trial with great
interest and indeed amusement, but now I must intervene for the sake of
justice. <br>
DOCTOR: Justice? Pay no attention, madam. He has no concept of what
justice is. He'd see me dead tomorrow. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Gladly, Doctor, but I'm not prepared to countenance
a rival. <br>
VALEYARD: My lady, I must propose an immediate adjournment. <br>
INQUISITOR: I'm sorry, Valeyard. The evidence for the prosecution is
completed. The ball, as the Doctor might say, is out of your court. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Doctor, I've sent you two star witnesses. I knew
you'd need them. <br>
VALEYARD: With due respect, Sagacity, the matter of witnesses is for
you to decide. We've seen enough to know that Glitz is an admitted
criminal. Any testimony from him must therefore be dubious in the
extreme. <br>
MEL: But not from me. I'm as truthful, honest, and about as boring as
they come. <br>
INQUISITOR: This court is not, for the moment, impugning your
integrity, young lady. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Let Sabalom Glitz speak. <br>
INQUISITOR: Criminals have been known to speak the truth, Valeyard,
especially when their own interests are not at stake. <br>
VALEYARD: My point, my lady, is that this person who calls himself the
Master, whoever he might be, should not be permitted to produce
surprise witnesses. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: You pretend not to know me, do you? I'm surprised
by the shortness of the Valeyard's memory. <br>
INQUISITOR: The Doctor may, in his defence, call witnesses to rebut
your evidence, after which you may cross-examine them. That is the
procedure, Valeyard. <br>
VALEYARD: My lady. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: If I might intercede? <br>
INQUISITOR: You have no part in these proceedings, sir. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Corporeally, of course not, but I'm present, and
enjoying myself enormously. <br>
INQUISITOR: Doctor, please examine your witnesses. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, madam. <br>
(Glitz is taken with the carvings on the Time Lord's benches.) <br>
GLITZ: This is real machonite, you know. Worth a few grotzits today,
Your Honour. <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz. <br>
GLITZ: I could make you a fair offer on a job lot, do you a very good
deal. <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz! <br>
GLITZ: What? <br>
DOCTOR: You were sent here by the Master. <br>
GLITZ: Yeah, well, he's a business partner, so to speak. We've had a
few nice little tickles together <br>
DOCTOR: This court is not interested in your sordid business deals,
Glitz. <br>
INQUISITOR: Very good, Doctor. Keep him to the point. <br>
DOCTOR: When we last met, you expressed interest in a box. <br>
GLITZ: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: What was in that box? <br>
GLITZ: I don't know. Scientific stuff, so he said. Stuff the Sleepers
have been nicking from the Matrix for years. <br>
KEEPER: The Matrix? My Matrix? <br>
GLITZ: Right. Well, it seems the Sleepers had found a way to break into
the Matrix, and they were creaming off all this high-tech info to take
back to Andromeda. <br>
DOCTOR: But they were operating from Earth. <br>
GLITZ: Of course. That was their cover, wasn't it. They knew that the
Time Lords eventually would trace the leak. <br>
VALEYARD: He's lying, my lady. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so, Stackyard. It all begins to make very good
sense. <br>
MEL: That's it, Doc. Now we're getting at the dirt. <br>
DOCTOR: Doc? Carry on, Glitz. What happened next? <br>
GLITZ: Well, eventually the Time Lords did suss out the leak, so they
wanted to wipe out all the Sleepers, and they used this er, magno.
Magno <br>
DOCTOR: Magnotron? <br>
GLITZ: That's it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that can only be done by an order in High Council. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Of course, Doctor. To protect their own secrets,
they drew the Earth and its constellation billions of miles across
space <br>
DOCTOR: Causing the fireball which nearly destroyed the planet. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Of little consequence in the High Council's
planning. The robot recovery mission from Andromeda sped past Earth out
into space. Gallifreyan secrets were saved, except that at the first
intimation of the coming fireball, the Andromedans were able to set up
a survival chamber for the Sleepers. <br>
DOCTOR: So that's why Earth was renamed Ravalox. That sanctimonious
gang of hypocrites were covering their tracks. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Exactly. It takes time, Doctor, but eventually you
get there. <br>
DOCTOR: They put an ancient culture like the Earth to the sword for the
sake of a few miserable, filthy scientific advances? <br>
GLITZ: Big market for them, Doctor, so he said. Worth a lot of
grotzits. <br>
DOCTOR: In all my travellings throughout the universe I have battled
against evil, against power-mad conspirators. I should have stayed
here. The oldest civilisation, decadent, degenerate and rotten to the
core. Ha! Power-mad conspirators, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, they're
still in the nursery compared to us. Ten million years of absolute
power, that's what it takes to be really corrupt. <br>
MEL: Take it easy, Doc. <br>
INQUISITOR: Doctor, these unseemly outbursts <br>
DOCTOR: Unseemly outbursts? If I hadn't visited Ravalox, as I then
thought of it, the High Council would have kept this outrage carefully
buried, as presumably they have for several centuries. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: I must agree. You have an endearing habit of
blundering into these things, Doctor, and the High Council took full
advantage of your blunder. <br>
INQUISITOR: Explain that. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: They made a deal with the Valeyard, or as I've
always known him, the Doctor, to adjust the evidence, in return for
which he was promised the remainder of the Doctor's regenerations. <br>
VALEYARD: This is clearly <br>
DOCTOR: Just a minute! Did you call him the Doctor? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: There is some evil in all of us, Doctor, even you.
The Valeyard is an amalgamation of the darker sides of your nature,
somewhere between your twelfth and final incarnation. And I may say,
you do not improve with age. <br>
DOCTOR: Madam, this revelation should halt this trial immediately.
Surely even Gallifreyan law must acknowledge that the same person
cannot be both prosecutor and defendant. <br>
INQUISITOR: The single purpose of this trial is to determine the
defendant's guilt or otherwise on the basis of the evidence that has
been presented. Anything else is, for the moment, irrelevant. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
(The Valeyard flees the courtroom.) <br>
MEL: Doctor! <br>
INQUISITOR: Valeyard! <br>
(The Doctor gives chase.) <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz, come on! <br>
GLITZ: What? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Space station]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: We need him. <br>
(The Valeyard is nowhere in sight.) <br>
GLITZ: But he hasn't had time. <br>
DOCTOR: There must be another way out of here. <br>
GLITZ: He's gone! <br>
KEEPER: The seventh door. He must have had a key. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
KEEPER: The seventh entrance to the Matrix. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, quickly, man, open it. He must be brought back. <br>
INQUISITOR: I agree. <br>
(The Keeper goes to a multi-coloured section of wall and gives the key
to the Doctor. The Doctor opens the panel to reveal glowing white
light.) <br>
KEEPER: You'll never find him. The Matrix is a micro-universe. <br>
MEL: Don't go, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I must. Perhaps nothing in my life has ever been so important.
Come on, Glitz. <br>
(The Doctor pulls Glitz inside.) <br>
GLITZ: Me? <br>
MEL: Doctor! <br>
INQUISITOR: Be silent! Come, let us return to the trial room. <br>
MEL: Why? There's nobody to try anymore. <br>
INQUISITOR: Come along, both of you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Courtyard]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (It is dark. A bell tolls and rats scavenge on the
straw-strewn paved ground of an alleyway. A bright light slants in,
then the Doctor appears. Welcome to the Gladstone Pottery Museum, Stoke
on Trent.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, what an unpleasant journey. What an unpleasant place. <br>
(A poster on the wall warns of cholera. A voice calls out in time with
the bell.) <br>
VALEYARD [OC]: Doctor. <br>
(Then it goes quiet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz? Glitz? <br>
VALEYARD [OC]: Bwahahahahahaha! <br>
(Children are singing.) <br>
CHILDREN [OC]: London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling
down. London Bridge is falling down, my fair lady. <br>
VALEYARD [OC]: Bwahahahahahaha! <br>
(The sounds of a music hall - piano playing and laughter - drift across
as the Doctor begins to explore. He runs towards them and they stop.
Then a single woman's voice laughs. The Doctor has run into an open
area. He looks into a water barrel.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I can't believe you're in there. <br>
(A pair of arms shoot out of the water and grab his head, pulling it
down.) <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz! Help! <br>
(A beam of light deposits Glitz in the nearby alleyway.) <br>
DOCTOR: Glitz! <br>
GLITZ: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hurry, man! <br>
(Glitz runs over to the Doctor, who is now lying on the cobbles.) <br>
GLITZ: What's going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. I don't know whether what just happened to me
was real or an illusion. <br>
GLITZ: Looks like someone's had a go at you. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mind? <br>
GLITZ: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Water. <br>
GLITZ: Oh, yeah, sure. <br>
DOCTOR: We're not in the real world any longer, Sabalom Glitz. Whatever
attacked me was in that barrel. <br>
GLITZ: Argh. <br>
DOCTOR: Or was it in my mind? <br>
GLITZ: How can we be in a different world? We just stepped through a
door, that's all. <br>
DOCTOR: Into the Matrix, where the only logic is that there isn't any
logic. <br>
GLITZ: Yeah, I knew this was a mistake. My grip on reality's not too
good at the best of times. Here, this is for you. <br>
(Glitz hands the Doctor a note.) <br>
GLITZ: Now, if you don't mind telling me, how do I get out of here? <br>
DOCTOR: It's from the Master. <br>
GLITZ: I know. I've just given it to you. He said it would be useful. <br>
DOCTOR: It tells me where the Valeyard has his base. <br>
GLITZ: (reads) The Fantasy Factory, proprietor J J Chambers. <br>
(The Doctor looks up to see the Fantasy Factory sign lit up.) <br>
DOCTOR: So that's where he got to. <br>
(The Doctor and Glitz walk towards it.) <br>
DOCTOR: So why is the Master helping me? <br>
GLITZ: Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll find out. I'm off. <br>
DOCTOR: No, come on. I want you to meet my darker side. <br>
GLITZ: I've done my bit. <br>
DOCTOR: Pop in and say hello. You'll be perfectly safe. <br>
(An upper storey of windows light up.) <br>
GLITZ: What's going on? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> INQUISITOR: Assuming I accept what you say about
the evidence against the Doctor, how much of it had been contrived? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: For a lie to work, madam, it must be shrouded in
truth. Therefore most of what you saw was true. <br>
INQUISITOR: Then the young woman, the one who died, was that true? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Ah, the delightful Miss Perpugilliam Brown. That
was clever of the Valeyard, exploiting the affection the Doctor had for
her. But then, of course, the Valeyard would know precisely how the
Doctor felt. <br>
INQUISITOR: Then she lives? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: As a queen, set up on high by that warmongering
fool Yrcanos. <br>
INQUISITOR: I am pleased. <br>

DOCTOR: Not when you're wearing a mark seven postidion life preserver. <br>
GLITZ: Yeah, well, whoever threw that harpoon didn't know that. So much
for illusions. Anyway, I thought it was you he was trying to kill. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he's playing games. He wants to humiliate me first. <br>
GLITZ: Oh, I see. He humiliates you by throwing harpoons at me. It
makes a lot of sense. <br>
DOCTOR: Your presence here makes his task more difficult. He knows
that. He also knows that together we can fight him. <br>
GLITZ: Look, Doctor, I'm a small-time crook with small-time ambitions,
one of which is to stay alive. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish you every good
luck, but I'm on my way. I've done my bit. <br>
DOCTOR: If you leave and I die, what future do you think you'll have?
As the only witness to events here, the Valeyard will be forced to seek
you out and kill you. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> INQUISITOR: In all my experience, I have never
before had to conclude a case in both the absence of the accused and
the prosecutor. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: One and the same person, madam. <br>
INQUISITOR: So you've said, but can you prove that? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: I know them both. But I suggest you question the
High Council. They set up this travesty of a trial, making a scapegoat
of the Doctor to conceal their own involvement. <br>
INQUISITOR: Is there any reason why I should accept that allegation
from a renegade Time Lord? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Yes, if you're concerned with learning the truth. <br>
INQUISITOR: What is your interest in this matter? Not, I think, concern
for the Doctor. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Oh, indeed not. The Doctor's well matched against
himself. One must destroy the other. <br>
MEL: How utterly evil. <br>
MASTER [on screen]: Thank you. I think I'd lay a shade more odds on the
Valeyard, though the possibility of their mutual destruction must
exist. That would be perfect. <br>
MEL: You're despicable. <br>
<i> MASTER [on screen]: So many compliments. May I say,
you're a charming child. <br>
MEL: You beast. <br>
</i> INQUISITOR: <i>Be quiet, girl.</i> Am I
to take it that some base desire for revenge is your motive for
interfering? <br>
MASTER [on screen]: There's nothing purer and more unsullied, madam,
than the desire for revenge. But, if you follow the metaphor, I've
thrown a pebble into the water, perhaps killing two birds with one
stone, and causing ripples that'll rock the High Council to its
foundations. What more could a renegade wish for? </font></p>

office, where a man is writing at a desk, using a quill pen and an oil
lamp for illumination.) <br>

GLITZ: Are you sure we're in the right place? <br>
(The Doctor rings the bell on the desk, and the man finally looks up.) <br>
POPPLEWICK: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: We'd like to see the proprietor, please. <br>
POPPLEWICK: Do you have an appointment, sir? Mister Chambers only sees
people by appointment. Most particular about appointments is our Mister
Chambers. <br>
DOCTOR: I think you'll find we're expected. <br>
POPPLEWICK: What is your name, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: I am known as the Doctor, and this is Mister Sabalom Glitz. <br>
(Popplewick checks in his book.) <br>
GLITZ: If this Valeyard wants you dead, he's got a funny way of going
about it. <br>
DOCTOR: I've told you. It's called humiliation. Could you hurry up,
please? We haven't got all day. <br>
POPPLEWICK: There are procedures to follow, sir. Necessary routines to
be completed. Even when I've found your names, there are many forms to
be inscribed before you may move on to the next stage of processing.
Processing is very important in this establishment. I'm sure that even
you will understand that such things cannot be rushed, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. I've always been a bit of an iconoclast by
nature. <br>

there are two more in this room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, at least you're expecting us. <br>
POPPLEWICK: We all are. <br>
GLITZ: You're lookalike out there wasn't. <br>
POPPLEWICK: He is the exception. The very junior Mister Popplewick
isn't permitted to expect anyone. <br>
GLITZ: What's he talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: I think it's called bureaucracy. <br>
POPPLEWICK: I prefer to call it order, and the holy writ of order is
procedure. I'm sure you agree. <br>
GLITZ: Oh, yeah, of course. <br>
POPPLEWICK: For example, you wish to see the proprietor. Now, the
correct procedure is to make an appointment. <br>
DOCTOR: But we're already expected. <br>
POPPLEWICK: But the junior Mister Popplewick isn't allowed to expect
anyone. <br>
GLITZ: You knew we were coming. Why didn't you give him the nod? <br>
POPPLEWICK: And upset the procedure? The junior Mister Popplewick has
his pride too. <br>
GLITZ: I don't understand any of this. Here we are, waiting to duck a
terminal knuckle sandwich, and all this screeve's going on about is
whether we've got an appointment or not. <br>
DOCTOR: Is there no way to expedite the procedure? <br>
POPPLEWICK: Expedite? I am a senior clerk, sir. To me, the procedure is
sacrosanct. My work is a celebration of all that is perfect. Why speed
perfection? <br>
DOCTOR: Because your employer wants me dead. <br>
POPPLEWICK: You seem to have found the one little weakness in our
procedure, sir. Would you sign this? <br>
DOCTOR: What is it? <br>
POPPLEWICK: A consent form, sir. The corridors in this factory are very
long and dark. Should you unexpectedly die, our blessed proprietor,
Mister J J Chambers, insists he inherits your remaining lives. <br>
DOCTOR: Obviously the Valeyard doesn't trust the High Council to honour
their side of the bargain. <br>
(The Doctor reaches for the quill tucked behind Mister Popplewick's
ear. He brushes his hand aside and gives him another quill.) <br>
GLITZ: Sign that and you're a dead man. <br>
DOCTOR: We're in the Valeyard's domain. He can try and kill me any time
he likes. I'll sign my remaining lives away to Mister J J Chambers. <br>
(The Doctor signs the parchment.) <br>
GLITZ: Are you sure about this? <br>
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Now can we see your proprietor? <br>
POPPLEWICK: The waiting room is through there. You will be summoned as
soon as your signature has been verified. <br>
GLITZ: This is madness. <br>
DOCTOR: Not if it precipitates my meeting with the Valeyard. <br>

art. There's nothing you can do to prevent the catharsis of spurious
morality. <br>
DOCTOR: If you could compile this monstrosity, it follows that I should
be able to unravel it. <br>
(Bang, sparks.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Trial room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mel rushes in. The Master's look of horror is
frozen on the screen.) <br>
MEL: Disconnect the Matrix! <br>
INQUISITOR: We cannot switch off without the Keeper, and he's not
present. <br>
MEL: Then get out of here, quickly. Your lives depend on it. <br>
(The guards are out first, because they're closest to the door. <br>
In the Matrix, the Valeyard finally frees himself as the Doctor
unscrews a brass connection, throws a switch and the contraption bursts
into flames. <br>
The Matrix screen explodes, sending energy bits rushing through the
courtroom over the heads of the cowering Time Lords, Inquisitor and
Mel.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Engine room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Eureka! And you said it couldn't be
immobilised. <br>
VALEYARD: What have you done? <br>
DOCTOR: Induced an anti-phase signal into the telemetry unit. The whole
system should self-destruct. <br>
VALEYARD: You blundering imbecile. You triggered a ray phase shift that
made a massive feedback into here. <br>
(The Valeyard pushes the Doctor to the floor.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
(The energy bits start to enter the Engine room.) <br>
VALEYARD: No. It's too late! <br>
(The Doctor runs out into the courtyard while the Valeyard collapses by
his machine. The Fantasy Factory explodes.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Trial room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (With the final explosion from the Matrix, it all
goes quiet. Everyone starts to sit up again. The Doctor runs in.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Now, let me see. Where were we? I was about to be
sentenced, I believe. <br>
INQUISITOR: All charges against you are dismissed, Doctor. We owe you
an immense debt of gratitude, which I can partly repay by telling you
that the young woman, Miss Perpugilliam Brown, is alive and well and
living as a warrior queen with King Yrcanos. <br>
(We are shown Peri with a full head of hair standing with Yrcanos.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Verumnic. <br>
INQUISITOR: Now then, once law and order have been restored, a new High
Council will need to be elected. Can I persuade you to stand for Lord
President again? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Ah ha. I've a better idea. <br>
MEL: He's going to suggest you stand. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed I am. And were there such a thing as an intergalactic
postal vote, you'd have mine. <br>
MEL: I shouldn't broadcast that, if I were you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you could do me one small favour, if you would. <br>
INQUISITOR: Simply name it. <br>
DOCTOR: When the Matrix is restored, you can do what you like with the
Master, but exercise leniency with Sabalom Glitz. He's not beyond
redemption. <br>
MEL: Just don't let him anywhere near the crown jewels. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Space station]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Gallifrey doesn't have any crown jewels. <br>
MEL: Right. A bracing glass of carrot juice. <br>
(The Doctor unlocks the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Carrot juice? <br>
MEL: And then we'll get you back on the exerciser. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I think I was rash in turning down that offer of the
Presidency. <br>
MEL: Come on. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Carrot juice? <br>
(They go into the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Carrot juice, carrot juice, carrot juice. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Trial room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> INQUISITOR: Repair the Matrix, Keeper. Requisition
anything you need. <br>
KEEPER: My Lady. <br>
(The Keeper bows deeply as the Inquisitor sweeps past and leaves, then
he turns to the camera and laughs. It is the Valeyard.) </font> </p>
