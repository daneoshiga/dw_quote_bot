powering its way through space. Clue - a photograph of three men has
one side torn off. Two men are asleep in their bunks whilst a third -
not in the photograph - is cleaning parts. He has a barcode on his neck
and bionic eyes. The computer beeps.) <br>
COMPUTER: Incoming salvage. Please validate. Incoming salvage. Please
validate. Incoming salvage. Please validate. <br>
(The taller of the two men gets up.) <br>
BRAM: Rusty garbage. It's not worth lacing up my boots. <br>
TRICKY: Wasting our time. There's no salvage this far out. <br>
BRAM: You're a lucky boy, Tricky. You're an android. You don't get
bored. <br>
(They look across at another man still in his bunk.) <br>
TRICKY: He won't turn back. Not with half a cargo. <br>
BRAM: He's not captain. We're equal partners. <br>
TRICKY: Yeah. Right. </font></p>

CLARA: I know what I said. I was the one who said it. <br>
DOCTOR: You said it was looking at you funny. <br>
CLARA: I was tired, overwrought. I didn't mean it. It's an appliance.
It does a job. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a pretty cool appliance. We're not talking cheese grater
here. <br>
CLARA: You're not getting me to talk to your ship. That's properly
bonkers. <br>
DOCTOR: (to console) It's okay, it's okay. <br>
CLARA: You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl
unless his mother approves. <br>
DOCTOR: It's important to me you get along. I could leave you two alone
together. <br>
CLARA: Now you're creeping me out. <br>
DOCTOR: Take the wheel. Not the wheel. I'll make it easy. Shut it down
to basic mode for you. <br>
CLARA: Basic? Because I'm a girl? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
(And turns a key labelled 'Smiths'. </font></p>

smell it. <br>
(Their radar has picked up the Tardis.) <br>
BRAM: It's just trash. <br>
TRICKY: No, look. There's something tasty in the magno-field. <br>
COMPUTER: Magno-grab ready. Engaging. <br>
(The cargo doors open wide like jaws.) <br>
GREGOR: Move yourself. <br>
(They get dressed - heavy boots, overalls, and a small grenade-like
device. A blue energy beam shoots out and grabs the Tardis whilst loud
music plays.) </font></p>

control.) <br>
CLARA: What have I done? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, okay. <br>
CLARA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: All the electrical impulses are jammed. I can't get the shields
back up. She's completely vulnerable. <br>
CLARA: I swear I just touched it. <br>
(The Doctor manages to push up a breaker lever and there is a big
bang.) <br>
DOCTOR: Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay
by me. <br>
CLARA: Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Big friendly button. <br>
CLARA: You're lying. <br>
DOCTOR: Yep. <br>
CLARA: To stop me freaking out? <br>
DOCTOR: Is it working? <br>
CLARA: Not so much. <br>
(The grenade device rolls along the floor. Clara picks it up and it
burns her hand. She drops it again. Bang!) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Huge sets of pincers pass the Tardis along inside
the ship.) <br>
TRICKY: What is it, some kind of escape pod? <br>
GREGOR: Come on. <br>
(The Tardis has been dumped onto a pile of cables and is lying at 45
degrees.) <br>
GREGOR: Crack it open. <br>
(Gregor runs forward with a large hammer. That has no effect. Next
comes the focused laser cutter.) <br>
BRAM: It's doing nothing. <br>
GREGOR: Use the thermo-charge and blast it. <br>
TRICKY: No, no, no, wait. It's like she's alive. She's, she's
suffering. I can feel it. I can feel it. <br>
That's just robot rant. <br>
BRAM: No, Gregor, he's right. Looks like there's a broken fuel line. <br>
(Steam is coming out of the top of the Tardis.) <br>
GREGOR: All right. All right, put it back. No salvage today, boys. Open
the bay doors. <br>
TRICKY: Wait. <br>
(Tricky's bionic eye zooms in on a boot sticking out of the cables
under the Tardis.) <br>
TRICKY: Somebody's under that thing. The crew were still on board when
we dragged her in. <br>
GREGOR: We did nothing. If anyone asks, that ship was already busted.
You got that? And you, make sure you keep your oily mouth shut, right? <br>
DOCTOR: It's rude to whisper. Hi. I'm the Doctor. And you are? Er, Van
Baalen and Van Baalen. Van Baalen and Van Baalen. That's going to get
confusing later. <br>
GREGOR: We found you drifting. <br>
BRAM: Yeah, your ship was junked up pretty bad. <br>
DOCTOR: What broke my ship was a magno-grab. Found this remote in your
pocket. Eh? What are the chances? Outlawed in most galaxies, this
little beastie can disable whole vessels unless you have shield
oscillators, which I turned off so that Clara could fly, damn it.
Clara. Where is she? Girl, about so high. Feisty. She's still on board.
<br>
TRICKY: No, wait. Your pod is leaking fuel. If she's still in here,
she's dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, respirators. <br>
GREGOR: We can open the doors for a split second, reach in and grab
her. <br>
DOCTOR: Trust me, we can't. Now please, help me get her out. <br>
TRICKY: I'm telling you, she fried <br>
GREGOR: Shut it, tin mouth. What sort of fee are we talking? <br>
DOCTOR: If you help me get her out, you get the machine, all the scrap,
eh? <br>
BRAM: It's not worth the risk. Four feet of metal? Nah. <br>
DOCTOR: What if I can guarantee you the best haul you've ever had? <br>
GREGOR: Bram, open the bay doors. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. Please, stop. Listen, listen. Right behind those doors
is the salvage of a lifetime. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Inside the Tardis, the Cloister bell is tolling.
Clara wakes up under an ornate but light piece of rubble.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor? <br>
(She blows on her burnt palm and walks along to a bulkhead door.) <br>
CLARA: Red flashing light means something bad. Get out of here fast? Or
possibly, whatever you do, don't open this door. <br>
(So she opens the door. There is an explosion.) <br>
CLARA: Bad decision. <br>
(She runs from the fireball and closes the next bulkhead door she
finds. There are deep claw marks in the wall nearby, and something
growls.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Salvage ship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRAM: Hey, are we really going to risk it? That
thing is spewing poison. We should blow it back into space. <br>
GREGOR: Get your gear. <br>
BRAM: Hey, I don't take orders from my kid brother. <br>
GREGOR: Don't try and form sentences, all right? Stick to what you do
best. <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, since when does an android need a blast suit and a
respirator? <br>
BRAM: Flesh coating, same as us. He'd burn up. <br>
TRICKY: No fear, no hate, no pain. <br>
(The Doctor unlocks the Tardis.) <br>
GREGOR: Salvage of a lifetime? <br>
DOCTOR: I feel pretty confident I can deliver on that. Here we go. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GREGOR: I don't get it. I thought she was lying on
her side. <br>
DOCTOR: The Tardis is special. She has her own gravity. I'd explain if
I had some charts and a board pen. <br>
GREGOR: It's, it's, it's bigger <br>
DOCTOR: On the inside. Do you know, I get that a lot. <br>
TRICKY: Whoa. Awesome. <br>
DOCTOR: Well put. Whoa and awesome. <br>
(The Doctor vents the fumes from the console room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Safe to breathe. <br>
(They all remove the respirators. The Doctor scans with the sonic
screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, now, the last thing I remember, you were right there.
Come on, Clara, talk to me. <br>
BRAM: How big is this baby? <br>
DOCTOR: Picture the biggest ship you've ever seen. Are you picturing
it? <br>
BRAM: Yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Now forget it, because this ship is infinite. <br>
GREGOR: It could take you hours to find the girl. <br>
DOCTOR: Days. Plus this whole place is toxic. She could be dead by the
time I reach her. So, here's the mission. We're going to find her in
one hour. <br>
GREGOR: We? <br>
DOCTOR: You're my guys for this. <br>
GREGOR: That wasn't the deal. <br>
DOCTOR: 'Tis now. <br>
BRAM: What makes you think we'll help? <br>
(A countdown clock starts on the scanner.) <br>
DOCTOR: I just activated the Tardis self-destruct system. One hour
until this ship blows. <br>
(Bram runs for the door, which slams in his face.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't try to leave. The Tardis is in lockdown. I'll open those
doors when Clara's by my side. <br>
BRAM: You crazy lunatic! <br>
DOCTOR: My ship, my rules. <br>
GREGOR: You'll kill us all. And the girl. <br>
DOCTOR: She's going to die if you don't help me. Don't get into a
spaceship with a madman. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Okay, a
little gently persuasion. Say thirty minutes. <br>
(The countdown jumps to 29:59:10.) <br>
BRAM: She'll die even quicker now! <br>
DOCTOR: We all perform better under pressure. Anybody want to go for
fifteen minutes? <br>
BRAM: Whoa! <br>
GREGOR: Whoa! <br>
DOCTOR: It's your own time you're wasting. Salvage of a lifetime. You
meant the ship. I meant Clara. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Clara finds an old-fashioned room with a stone
arched door, and the Doctor's cradle. She takes down a model of the
Tardis from a shelf. Someone or something else is there with her. Clara
spots it as she picks up a black umbrella.) <br>
CLARA: Oh! <br>
(And runs out.) </font></p>

Bram.) <br>
GREGOR: Report. What's on board this thing? <br>
COMPUTER: Dynomorphic generators, conceptual geometer, beam
synthesiser, orthogonal engine filters. <br>
(He catches the others up.) <br>
GREGOR: Guys, guys, look, I think we should split up. It's our best
chance of finding the girl. You know it is. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't touch a thing. The Tardis will get huffy if you mess. <br>
GREGOR: Keep in radio contact, all right? <br>
(Tricky nods and goes off with the Doctor.) <br>
GREGOR: Get back to the console. Strip it apart. <br>
BRAM: Okay. <br>
GREGOR: All right? <br>

past an observatory with lovely big Victorian telescope and an open air
swimming pool into -) </font></p>

Relative Dimension In Space. <br>
DOCTOR 3 [OC]: The Tardis is dimensionally transcendental. <br>
JO: [OC]: What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR 4 [OC]: That's trans-dimensional engineering. A key Time Lord
discovery. <br>
DOCTOR 9 [OC]: The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get
through that door. Believe me, they've tried. <br>
AMY [OC]: We are in space! <br>
IAN [OC]: It can move anywhere in time and space? <br>

COMPUTER: Everything. <br>
GREGOR: I don't understand. Give me a price tag. <br>
COMPUTER: Incalculable. <br>
GREGOR: What? <br>
COMPUTER: More valuable than the total sum of any currency. Living
metal. Bespoke engineering. Whatever machine you require, this system
will build it. <br>
(Gregor raises the focused laser cutter to take some. The Doctor and
Tricky run in.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! No, no, stop! Please, don't. Don't touch it. Please. She
won't let you touch it. I can feel a Tardis tantrum coming on. <br>
GREGOR: What the hell is this place? <br>
DOCTOR: Architectural Reconfiguration System. It reconstructs particles
according to your needs. <br>
GREGOR: A machine that makes machines? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, basically. What are you doing? No, no, don't. Don't! <br>
(Gregor takes hold of one of the Gallifreyan engraved light bulbs.) <br>
DOCTOR: If you walk out of here with that circuit, the Tardis will try
to stop you. Now listen to me. Look, the clock is ticking. We must find
Clara. <br>
(Gregor pulls off the light bulb and the whole ship roars.) <br>
GREGOR: What the? Where's the door gone? <br>
DOCTOR: Ever seen a spaceship get ugly? <br>
GREGOR: This isn't happening. <br>
DOCTOR: She won't relinquish it. Her basic genetic material. <br>
GREGOR: Torch it. I said, torch it. <br>
TRICKY: Can't you feel it, Gregor? The ship, the ship's in torment,
like it's a living thing. You can't hurt it. <br>

stand - The History of the Time War. She opens it in the middle and
does a little reading.) <br>
CLARA: So that's who <br>
(Clang, growl. She dodges behind another rack of books and bottle to
hide from the thing. Above her are bottles containing the Encyclopedia
Gallifreyica. We can hear muffled voices. Clara presses back against
the rack, one of the bottles tips over, and the words tumble out over
her head. She wafts them away so the creature cannot hear. It gets
close and she runs for the entrance.) </font></p>

reach Clara in time. <br>
(Gregor walks away, and they follow.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hey! Hey! <br>
(And return from the opposite direction.) <br>
TRICKY: It's just the same, again. <br>
DOCTOR: No point in building walls. You'll just know how to smash them
down. It's found other ways of controlling you. Smart bunch, Time
Lords. No dress sense, dreadful hats, but smart. If you want to get out
of here, let that circuit go. It is creating a labyrinth. <br>

GREGOR: It's too late, he's gone. Let's just worry about the salvage. <br>
TRICKY: You care more about that circuit than you do about him. <br>
DOCTOR: Your concern for your brother is really touching. The android
is more cut up about it that you. Now will you two stop bickering and
listen. There is something else down there. <br>
TRICKY: We've got to get out of here. Gregor, give it back. Give it
back to her. <br>
(Tricky takes the light bulb from Gregor's pack.) <br>
GREGOR: What are you doing? You're always on the side of the machines. <br>
DOCTOR: Fellas! Multiple lifeforms on board the Tardis with us. I am
getting a massive signal. <br>
TRICKY: Where are they? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you're not going to like the answer. About two steps away.
One step. <br>

protect us. <br>

DOCTOR: Team Tardis. <br>
(The Doctor rummages in the wreck of the console. A piece of metal
falls, and lands in Clara's console room.) <br>
TRICKY: Where did, where did that go? <br>
DOCTOR: There's more than one echo room. Hey, look, look. The Tardis
has got Clara safe. That was her. That was her there. Thank you, thank
you, thank you. <br>
TRICKY: Why can't we see her? <br>

super-infinite speeds. We're only together for a brief second. Shush. <br>

DOCTOR: I can hear her. <br>
(Clara opens an internal door. The creature is behind it. She screams.
The Doctor and Tricky can hear the growling.) <br>

Good guys do not have zombie creatures. Rule one basic storytelling. <br>

back. Now cancel the self-destruct. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Ah. You know, I've got to tell you, I won't be needing you
in my quiz team. <br>
GREGOR: What? <br>
DOCTOR: There is no self-destruct. Hey? Hey? Hey? Had you going though,
boys, didn't I? I just wiggled a few buttons. Yeah, the old wiggly
button trick. And the face. You've got to do the face. Save her or we
all die. I though I rushed it a bit, but <br>
TRICKY: So you're telling us we're safe? <br>
DOCTOR: Ish. Apart from the monsters and the Tardis reinventing the
architecture every five minutes. Guys, don't worry. The countdown's a
fake. Look, just give me a second. I'll turn it off. I only made it
look as though the engine was actually exploding. <br>
(Eye of Harmony. Engine status: Overload.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. That's not good. Okay, don't panic. Or maybe panic. <br>
CLARA: Something you want to share with the rest of us? <br>
DOCTOR: It appears the engine is damaged. We're in trouble, Clara.
Proper trouble. It needs fixing or we're toast. <br>
CLARA: So now would be a good time to use that big friendly button,
right? <br>

DOCTOR: Clara, stop. Don't touch it. There's a rupture in time
somewhere on board the ship. A small tear in the fabric of the
continuum. It must have happened when the Tardis was pulled in by the
salvage vessel. The Tardis is leaking. <br>
CLARA: Leaking what? <br>
(He leads her along the corridors.) <br>
DOCTOR: The past. You and me. Everything we've done, everything we've
said. Recent history. It's not real. It's a memory. <br>
(They come across the single bodied glowing red eyed creature.) <br>
CLARA: What about this? <br>
DOCTOR: If you're giving me the option, I'd say this one's real. <br>
(They run away. It chases them.) <br>
DOCTOR: She's right on to us. <br>
CLARA: She? <br>
DOCTOR: Clara, don't ask me any more. <br>
CLARA 2: You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl
unless his mother approves. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: It's important to me you get along. <br>
(The creature follows the echo people. There is a banging sound.) <br>
CLARA: What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: We're right under the primary fuel cells. <br>
CLARA: So? So, so what? <br>
DOCTOR: So, so the fuel's spilled out, so the rods will be exposed.
Means they'll cool <br>
CLARA: And start to warp. <br>
DOCTOR: And start to warp. Maybe even <br>
CLARA: No, you don't say it. Don't you dare say it. <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe even break apart. <br>
(A rod flies through the walls just in front of them.) <br>
CLARA: Run? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm liking how you're thinking. <br>
CLARA: Yeah. <br>
(They run as more rods pierce the corridors from different angles. Up
ahead, someone screams. Tricky has been speared by a rod through his
shoulder.) <br>
TRICKY: Cut it off. Just cut my arm off. <br>
GREGOR: No. <br>
TRICKY: It's the quickest way to release me. No fear, no hate, no pain.
I can get a new one. Disposable parts. Just do it. It won't hurt me. <br>
GREGOR: Tricky, you just don't understand. <br>
TRICKY: I'm an android. Cut me! <br>
CLARA: You made it through. <br>
TRICKY: What's the matter with you? Why won't you cut me? <br>
DOCTOR: Tell him. <br>
TRICKY: Tell me what? <br>
DOCTOR: You can't, can you. You're a coward. You won't save him, but
you're scared to tell him why. <br>
TRICKY: What's he going on about? <br>
DOCTOR: Robots don't need blast suits. They don't need respirators.
They don't get frightened of monsters in the dark. <br>
TRICKY: What's he talking about? <br>
DOCTOR: Two bionic eyes and a synthetic voice box. But you, my friend,
are human. Flesh and blood. <br>
GREGOR: It was a joke. <br>
TRICKY: What? <br>
GREGOR: It was just a stupid joke. We did it to relieve the boredom. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it was very funny. They lied to you. Changed your
identity just to provide some in-flight entertainment. <br>
GREGOR: I'm sorry. You're human, Tricky. <br>
DOCTOR: Cut the metal. Cut the metal! Go! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GREGOR: Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Power source. Right, you lot, wait here. I'll check it's safe.
We can only survive for a minute or two in there. <br>
CLARA: Er, what happens if we stay longer? <br>
DOCTOR: Our cells with liquefy and our skin will start to burn. <br>
CLARA: I always feel so good after we've spoken. <br>
DOCTOR: Marvellous. Keep this door shut. <br>
CLARA: That will not be a problem. <br>
(The Doctor enters the room. Gregor scans Clara.) <br>
COMPUTER: Lancashire. Sass. <br>
GREGOR: Intelligent sensor. <br>
TRICKY: Ever pointed that thing at yourself, Gregor? What would it see?
What sort of person does this to another human? Made them believe
they're made of metal. Who am I? <br>
(Gregor rips a patch off his suit. Van Baalen Bros. The Doctor runs
through the engine room and pulls open a door on the other side.) <br>
GREGOR: My mouthy little kid brother. <br>
TRICKY: Why, why can't I remember? <br>
GREGOR: It was a salvage accident. There was a big explosion. You lost
your sight, voice and your memory. <br>
TRICKY: And you, you thought of a way you could have some fun with me?
I just wanted a brother beside me! <br>
GREGOR: You were always the smart one, Tricky. He wanted you to take
over. He made you captain. <br>
TRICKY: He? <br>
GREGOR: Dad. <br>
TRICKY: I don't remember him. You did this to me just to be captain of
a heap of junk. <br>
(Tricky attacks Gregor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stop! Tricky, listen to me. Ask yourself why he couldn't cut
you up. He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him, and you
helped him find that, okay? Now you. Don't ever forget this. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Very orange atmosphere.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, move, move, move. <br>
(They all run onto the catwalk.) <br>
DOCTOR: The Eye of Harmony. Exploding star in the act of becoming a
black hole. Time Lord engineering. You rip the star from its orbit,
suspend it in a permanent state of decay. This way, quickly. <br>
(But there is a creature behind the other door. And the female is at
the one they have just come through.) <br>
GREGOR: There's no way out. We're trapped. <br>
CLARA: You're going to tell me right now. If we're going to die here,
you're going to tell me what they are. <br>
DOCTOR: I can't. <br>
CLARA: Tell me. What's the use in secrets now? <br>
DOCTOR: Secrets protect us. Secrets make us safe. <br>
CLARA: We're not safe! <br>
COMPUTER: Sensor detects animal DNA. Human core element. Calculating
data. Calculating data. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, turn it off! <br>
COMPUTER: Lancashire. Sass. Identifiable substance. Clara. <br>
CLARA: That's me. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry. <br>
CLARA: It's me. I burn in here. <br>
DOCTOR: It isn't just the past leaking out through the time rift. It's
the future. Listen, I brought you here to keep you safe, but it
happened again. You died again. <br>
CLARA: What do you mean, again? <br>
(Tricky and Gregor are trying to keep the door closed against another
creature.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hang on. As long as we can interrupt the timeline, this can't
happen. Don't touch each other, otherwise the future will reassert
itself. <br>
(He pulls them back, and the creature breaks in. It claws at Gregor's
backpack with the light bulb in it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gregor, Gregor, let go of the circuit. <br>
TRICKY: Just let it go. <br>
DOCTOR: Gregor, Gregor. <br>
(Tricky knocks this creature off the catwalk. Presumably it is future
burnt Doctor or maybe Bram, although he is already dead. Then the
conjoined creature and burnt Clara break in.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. Er, er <br>
(Tricky attacks the conjoined creature, kicking it off the catwalk. He
is left dangling.) <br>
GREGOR: Tricky! <br>
CLARA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: No, don't touch him, or time will reassert itself. <br>
(Gregor pulls Tricky up onto the catwalk and they change into the
conjoined creature. The Doctor and Clara get out just in time.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: The engine room. The heart of the Tardis. <br>
(They run forward to the edge of a cliff.) <br>
CLARA: We're outside. <br>
DOCTOR: No, we're still in the Tardis. <br>
CLARA: There's no way across. <br>
DOCTOR: No, okay, you're right. <br>
CLARA: So what do we do? Time for a plan. Do you have a plan? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, no. No plan. Sorry. <br>
CLARA: If you don't have a plan, we're dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. So just tell me. <br>
CLARA: Tell you what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's no point now. We're about to die. Just tell me
who you are. <br>
CLARA: You know who I am. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I don't. I look at you every single day and I don't
understand a thing about you. Why do I keep running into you? <br>
CLARA: Doctor, you invited me. You said <br>
DOCTOR: Before that. I met you in the Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in
a shipwreck and she died saving my life, and she was you. <br>
CLARA: She really wasn't. <br>
DOCTOR: Victorian London. There was a governess who was really a
barmaid, and we fought the Great Intelligence together. She died and it
was my fault, and she was you. <br>
CLARA: You're scaring me. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you, eh? Are you a trick, a trap? <br>
CLARA: I don't know what you're talking about! <br>
(And nearly steps back off the edge of the cliff. The Doctor grabs her
and holds her tight in his arms.) <br>
DOCTOR: You really don't, do you. <br>
CLARA: I think I'm more scared of you right now than anything else on
that Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: You're just Clara, aren't you. <br>
(Another hug.) <br>
CLARA: Okay, I don't know what the hell this is about, but the hug is
really nice. <br>
DOCTOR: We're not going to die here. This isn't real! It's a snarl. <br>
CLARA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: What does a wounded animal do? It tries to scare everyone away.
We're close to the engine. The Tardis is snarling at us, trying to
frighten us off. We need to jump. <br>
CLARA: You're insane. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll cross a portal to the engine. <br>
CLARA: How can you be so sure? <br>
DOCTOR: I can't. <br>
CLARA: Okay, well, that's watertight. <br>
DOCTOR: Hey now, Clara, I have piloted this ship for over nine hundred
years. Trust me this one time, please. Okay. Okay. As well as all the
other times. Ready? Geronimo. <br>
(They run and jump off the edge of the cliff into a white space filled
with pieces of metal frozen in time as they travel out from an
explosion.) <br>
DOCTOR: The heart of the Tardis. The engine, it's already exploded. It
must have been the collision with the salvage ship. <br>
CLARA: We're not dead. <br>
DOCTOR: She wrapped her hands around the force. Froze it. <br>
CLARA: So, so it's safe? <br>
DOCTOR: Temporary fix. Eventually this whole place will erupt. There's
no way I can save her now. She's just always been there for me, and
taken care of me, and now it's my turn and I don't know what to do. I
think it just <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, Clara. Oh. <br>
(She has Big Friendly Button burnt into her palm.) <br>
DOCTOR: You are beautiful. Beautiful fragile human skin. Like
parchment. Thank you. The rift in time. All the memories leaking out. I
need to find the moment we crashed. I need to find the music. </font></p>

they used their magno-grab. There is a vertical crack in the wall with
bright light streaming through.) <br>
DOCTOR: The time rift. Recent past, possible future. <br>
CLARA: What are you going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Rewrite today, I hope. <br>
(He uses the sonic screwdriver to etch the letters onto the grenade.) <br>
DOCTOR: I've thrown this through the rift before. I need to make sure
this time. Going to take it in there myself. There might be a certain
amount of yelling. <br>
CLARA: It's going to hurt? <br>
DOCTOR: Things that end your life often do that. <br>
CLARA: Wait! All those things you said. How we've met before, how I
died. <br>
DOCTOR: Clara, don't worry. You'll forget. Time mends us. It can mend
anything. <br>
CLARA: I don't want to forget. Not all of it. The library. I saw it.
You were mentioned in a book. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm mentioned in a lot of books. <br>
CLARA: You call yourself Doctor. Why do you do that? You have a name.
I've seen it. In one corner of that tiny <br>
DOCTOR: If I rewrite today, you won't remember. You won't go looking
for my name. <br>
CLARA: You'll still have secrets. <br>

he pushes against an immense force until he suddenly vanishes.) </font></p>
