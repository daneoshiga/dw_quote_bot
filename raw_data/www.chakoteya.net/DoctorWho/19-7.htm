NYSSA: Cyber fleet dispersed. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, great. You make it sound like a shopping list, ticking off
things as you go. Aren't you forgetting something rather important?
Adric is dead. <br>
NYSSA: Tegan, please. <br>
DOCTOR: We feel his loss as well. <br>
TEGAN: Well, you could do more than grieve. You could go back. <br>
NYSSA: Could you? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
NYSSA: But surely the Tardis is quite capable of <br>
TEGAN: We can change what happened if we materialise before Adric was
killed. <br>
DOCTOR: And change your own history? <br>
TEGAN: Look, the freighter could still crash into Earth. That doesn't
have to be changed. Only Adric doesn't have to be on board. <br>
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, both of you. There are some rules that cannot
be broken even with the Tardis. Don't ever ask me to do anything like
that again. You must accept that Adric is dead. His life wasn't wasted.
He died trying to save others, just like his brother, Varsh. You know,
Adric had a choice. This is the way he wanted it. <br>
TEGAN: We used to fight a lot. I'll miss him. <br>
NYSSA: So will I. <br>
DOCTOR: And me. But he wouldn't want us to mourn unnecessarily. <br>
NYSSA: Where are we going? <br>
DOCTOR: Special treat to cheer us all up. <br>
NYSSA: 1851, Earth, London. What's so special about that, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Hyde Park, the Crystal Palace. <br>
TEGAN: 1851. The Great Exhibition? <br>
DOCTOR: All the wonders of Victorian science and technology. <br>
TEGAN: Well, the Tardis should feel at home. <br>
DOCTOR: How about opening day? Pass the time of day with the foreign
royals. We could even drop in at Lords, see a few overs from Wisden and
Pilch. I wonder if the Lion will be bowling? <br>
TEGAN: Let's get there first. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, all right. <br>
(The Tardis lurches and keeps shaking.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nyssa, have you touched the dimensional stabilisers? <br>
NYSSA: Of course not. All systems functioning normally. <br>
DOCTOR: It could be the relative drift compensator. <br>
NYSSA: No. <br>
TEGAN: Some sort of turbulence? <br>
DOCTOR: Feedback from the solar comparator? No. <br>
NYSSA: Another ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Another ship? What do you mean, another ship? <br>
NYSSA: If it builds up at this frequency, it could draw us into spatial
convergence. We must materialise immediately. <br>
TEGAN: But we're due to land in London in a few minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: If we don't materialise, the Tardis will be destroyed. </font></p>

We could be in the path of an oncoming aircraft. <br>

into his walkie-talkie.) <br>

NYSSA: At least we won't be noticed. <br>
TEGAN: What do you mean, because this is a police box? <br>
NYSSA: Well, this is Earth. For once it's a perfect camouflage. <br>

ANDREWS: Not to mention all those VIPs waiting for the arrival of one

SHEARD: Now, Mister Horton, we need you to explain to us exactly what
you saw on the radar screen when Victor Foxtrot began the deceleration
procedure. <br>
ANDREWS: That's not possible. What? I'll be right over. Something very
odd going on in Terminal One. <br>

ANDREWS: I must insist, sir. Security. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Security. <br>
ANDREWS: You have the key, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: UNIT. <br>
ANDREWS: Sir? <br>
DOCTOR: You'd do much better to check with UNIT, department C19. Sir
John Sudbury is the man you want. <br>
ANDREWS: And who exactly are you, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just tell him it's the Doctor. And do send my regards to
Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart. Unless, of course, he's a General by now.

Naval Intelligence assure us that far from crashing, no aircraft even
broke cloud cover. <br>

SHEARD: A doctor with a police box. Really, Sir John, I hardly. Yes,
yes, of course I appreciate the political ramifications, but <br>

SHEARD: Yes, but surely that's all the more reason for not wasting time
with this doctor. Yes, I. Yes, I beg your pardon. Of course, if you
insist, Sir John. <br>

ANDREWS: The party with the police box in Terminal One have full
security clearance from C19. <br>
SHEARD: That was UNIT. We are obliged to brief this doctor on the

HORTON: Well, this morning's Concorde flight from New York disappeared
from the radar just after its deceleration. <br>
DOCTOR: Disappeared? <br>
HORTON: Yes, it just faded from the screen. <br>
TEGAN: It didn't crash? <br>
HORTON: It was flying on a level course, all systems were working
normally. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. I wonder. <br>
TEGAN: Wonder what? <br>
DOCTOR: Remember the turbulence we experienced? <br>
TEGAN: That forced us to materialise? <br>

DOCTOR: We must follow the same route, same height, same speed, and
with my equipment on board I can identify what I believe to be an
exponential time contour. <br>
SHEARD: And you really believe that Victor Foxtrot flew into a time
warp? <br>

NYSSA: The Xeraphin? <br>

it was devastated by crossfire in the Vardon-Kosnax war. <br>
HAYTER: Oh Doctor, please, on top of everything else, not little green
men from outer space. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there's nothing green about the Xeraphin, I assure you.
Highly developed creatures. Beings with immense mental power. <br>
TEGAN: Doesn't it remind you of something? <br>
NYSSA: The work of a tissue compression eliminator. <br>
HAYTER: What are you talking about? <br>
TEGAN: Well, it's a little toy of the Master's. <br>
DOCTOR: It's the weapon I warned you against. If the Master used it on
you, you'd end up just like this. They must have come out of the
casket. <br>
HAYTER: But the thing in there is alive, and there's only one organism.

DOCTOR: <i>Don't you see? Cellular fusion. Reduction to a
hypostatic amalgam.</i> No wonder the animus is so strong. Apart
from the Master's victims, the entire race of the Xeraphin is in this

DOCTOR: And he hasn't got the temporal limiter. The idea, you see, is
to keep him waiting until we're ready to take off. <br>
NYSSA: Why do we need Concorde? Can't we all go back in the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: No. I need the Tardis to deal with the Master. <br>
(The compressed air supply is nearly ready. Nyssa is playing out a roll
of wire.) <br>
NYSSA: Doctor, how are you doing to deal with the Master? Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm thinking about it. </font></p>

waiting for the Doctor. </font></p>

knowing what'll happen going over this ground at two hundred knots. <br>
BILTON: What happens when we get airborne? <br>
STAPLEY: That rather depends on the Doctor, doesn't it. <br>

STAPLEY: I suppose he could end up anywhere in the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Heathrow, actually. <br>
STAPLEY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: He's virtually running in a new Tardis. In order to check out
the temporal dimensions, he'll need to track back the line of the time
contour. <br>
BILTON: He'll land up in London with that nucleus on board? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
STAPLEY: But that's disaster! <br>
DOCTOR: Quite right. Shall we go on board? <br>
TEGAN: The passengers are coming too? <br>
STAPLEY: The passengers are your responsibility, Tegan. When you get
them on board, stand by these tyres. <br>
TEGAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we do apologise for the delay. Your flight
is now ready for boarding. Would you care to proceed to your aircraft
immediately? </font></p>

DOCTOR: Not with my temporal limiter in circuit. <br>
NYSSA: Why, doesn't it work? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course it does. You don't think I could fool the Master, do
you? Mind you, there is an inhibition factor inherent in the er,
programming. <br>
NYSSA: What does that mean? <br>

STAPLEY: Start number three engine. (it does) Start number two engine.

(Tegan runs to the plane.) <br>
STAPLEY: Start number one engine. Start number four engine. I want
reverse thrust on three and four so I can turn the aircraft and clear
that ramp. <br>
(The Doctor climbs out of the Tardis. Concorde begins to taxi.) <br>
STAPLEY: I'll abandon takeoff prior to V one only on the loss of two
engines. <br>
DOCTOR: Ready to go? <br>
STAPLEY: Yes, Doctor. Fasten your seatbelt for takeoff, please. At V
two, we'll maintain our climb-out at theta two, at full power. Cross
your fingers. This is it, gentlemen. Three, two, one, now. <br>
(Concorde accelerates across the ground. It's a rough ride.) <br>
SCOBIE: Power checked. <br>
BILTON: V one. Rotate. <br>
(Stapley pulls up the controls and Concorde lifts into the air.) <br>
STAPLEY: What did I tell you, Doctor? Finest aircraft in the world. <br>
BILTON: V two. <br>

BILTON: Gear selected. <br>

NYSSA: What a funny way to travel. <br>
TEGAN: Kind of fun, though. <br>
NYSSA: You miss it, don't you. <br>
TEGAN: Oh, I don't know. It's not exactly dull travelling with the
Doctor. <br>

not to mention judgement. <br>

NYSSA: The Xeraphin will never be able to regenerate. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, they stand a much better chance on their own planet. <br>
NYSSA: You sent them to Xeraphas? But the radiation will <br>

perfectly clear by now. Not a very nice climate for the Master, though.

NYSSA: He'll just take off again. <br>
