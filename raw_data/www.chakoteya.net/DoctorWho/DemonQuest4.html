<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Picture this. A day in July.
Central Park West, New York City. 1976. The skies were blue, and the
park was swarming with New Yorkers and visitors drinking up the sun.
And there was I, at the pretzel stand by the West Gate. I'm Buddy, and
I'm gonna tell you about the strange events of a few days when the
whole of New York seemed to go crazy, and Miss Starfall captured the
hearts and minds of the city's denizens. Miss Starfall, the Big Apple's
latest and undoubtedly greatest superheroine. You see, I knew all about
it, true believers. I got the skinny on all those strange and
spectacular events because I was there. I was the poor guy who happened
to be right at the centre of the action. How? Well, I was the fella who
found the meteorite in Central Park. But maybe that's getting ahead of
myself. Maybe I should begin with Alice, my girl. Yeah, Alice, staring
down at the Park from a window of a fantastic suite in the Dakota
Building, that luxurious apartment block. From there she could see me,
working hard at my stand, hawking my wares. Every morning, she caught
my eye and waved down at me, her lowly bum of a boyfriend. She always
seemed to me like a princess in a fairy tale tower.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIMSY: Alice. Alice Trefusis, come away from that
window at once. Do I pay you to lollygag at windows? Am I paying you to
wave at strangers?<br>
(Think Baby Jane Hudson played by Bette Davis.)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Huh. That's Mimsy Loyne,
legendary movie star. She's from a different, more glamorous age, is
Miss Loyne. All these years after her own star fell out of the
Hollywood firmament, Mimsy is a dried out old husk, bitter and nasty as
a sackful of prunes.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: I'm sorry, Miss Loyne. It's just that the
Park looks so beautiful today in the sun.<br>
MIMSY: You are looking at that damn fool pretzel seller. You don't need
to lie to me, girl. Come and sit by my chaise longue. We need to get to
work on chapter a hundred and thirty seven.<br>
ALICE: Yes, Miss Loyne.<br>
MIMSY: I was four.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Alice was the old monster's
literary secretary. She had to explain to me what that was. Something
about helping the old dame write up her memoirs. But maybe beginning
with them is the wrong place after all. Maybe I should begin with that
strange bunch of people in the hidden away attic of the Dakota
Building. The secret society who met each evening that summer to light
candles and gussy themselves up in strange ceremonial robes.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The cultists chant breathy mostly unintelligible
syllables, multiple voices making things even harder.)<br>
CULTISTS: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cos hoc tear pen, Cos har rite pen. Now amana
missis quo. Quo mars hanna aram. Betor bainga. Betor betingo. Yet
factor hit. Fat deity ho. Fat deity ho.</font> (continues)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Even in the sweltering heat of a
New York July, they met to perform their peculiar ceremonials under the
low eaves of that Gothic mansion. And they weren't light-weight robes
neither. But hey, this is New York. What you gonna say? Who cares what
crazy stuff people get up to in their own time, or what knitwear they
wind round their necks. But the problem was, these bizarre rites
weren't so harmless as you might think. Oh, but that's not the right
place to begin either. I should mention the previous evening. I'd
packed up my stall. Alice had managed to get a couple of hours away
from her dragon mistress. We were taking advantage of the cooler night
breezes, and we were walking through the Park.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Distant car horn.)<br>
ALICE: I feel like I'll never escape from her. Her autobiography's
endless. We're only up to Pearl Harbour.<br>
BUDDY: Hey, just a few more months, you said, and then it'll be over.<br>
ALICE: (sighs) If I didn't need the money so much.<br>
BUDDY: And I ain't much help. The money I make hawking pretzels, I
can't even afford pretzels for dinner.<br>
(Something roaring overhead.)<br>
BUDDY: Hey! <br>
(Whoosh, boom!)<br>
BUDDY: What the?<br>
ALICE: Oh, my God! Did you see that?<br>
BUDDY: See it? It's still scorching into my retina.<br>
ALICE: What was that, a meteorite?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Alice only had another twenty
minutes free time, and we spent them roaming in the dark trees beyond
the duck pond, hoping to find what had landed. But it wasn't too nice
in there, gloomy and not a good place to go hunting after dark. We
found nothing that night.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: I'd better get back to Mimsy's apartment.<br>
BUDDY: Shame.<br>
ALICE: Yeah. See you later.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: But then I guess this story of
mine really gets into action when the Doctor arrived in New York City,
July twelfth 1976. (The Tardis materialises beneath the dialogue.) He
was here with two friends of his, a man and a woman. One of them didn't
look happy at all.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Nothing could be as dangerous or as deadly
as the ordeal that Mike and I have recently undergone, Mrs Wibbsey.
This little jaunt will be a doddle, I promise.<br>
MIKE: He's right, you know. I never thought I'd get out of that Alpine
hotel alive.<br>
WIBBSEY: A doddle, he says. He said I was going to enjoy going to Paris
with him. Well, I didn't. <br>
DOCTOR: Stop complaining. You're suddenly giving me a headache. Look, I
even managed to get us slap-bang in the middle of Central Park, right
time and place. The Tardis is feeling more like her old self. One whiff
of the fourth artefact and she was here, even with one crucial piece of
the spatial geometer still missing, no small thanks to you, Mrs Wibbsey.<br>
WIBBSEY: Here we go.<br>
DOCTOR: If you hadn't given away one of the most vital components from
the Tardis to someone who looked very like the Emperor Tiberius
Claudius Nero Germanicus in the Church Hall jumble sale<br>
MIKE: All right, Doctor, you've made your point. Mrs Wibbsey, you're
needed on this trip just as much as I am. All three of us appear on
that comic book cover you have there. Since you were given it with the
other artefacts, it's obviously the next clue in our paper trail.<br>
WIBBSEY: That doesn't mean I have to like being here, does it?<br>
DOCTOR: But we're in New York, New York, New York! at just about the
time it's becoming the cultural capital of your world. And we've got
work to do. Oh! Oh! <br>
WIBBSEY: What is it? What's the matter?<br>
MIKE: You look as if you're having a funny turn.<br>
DOCTOR: I don't feel at all well.<br>
MIKE: That's not like you.<br>
DOCTOR: Must be something nasty in the atmosphere. Can't either of you
feel it?<br>
WIBBSEY: Feel what, exactly?<br>
DOCTOR: I don't know, but whatever it is, I don't like it, Wibbs.<br>
MIKE: Do you want to sit down?<br>
DOCTOR: Sit down when there's work to be done? Come along.<br>
WIBBSEY: What was all that about?<br>
MIKE: Beats me, but he looks quite drawn suddenly, doesn't he.<br>
WIBBSEY: He'd better not blame my steak and kidney pudding.<br>
DOCTOR: Pity there's no one down at that pretzel stand. It's always
best to start chatting to the locals. Oh, who's on for a stroll in the
Park, huh?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Okay, so I'd left my post
unattended, so shoot me. But that morning I was taking an early lunch
break and perambulating through the trees with my beloved Alice, who
was trembling and upset, having been on the receiving end of yet
another bawling out from her hideous employer.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: I can't stand it much longer, Buddy. She's a
crazy woman. This morning, she got so stuck into her memories she
thought I was her old co-star and rival Jessica Flintheart, and she
started yelling and screaming and I thought she was gonna leap right
off of her chaise longue and what, what is it, Buddy?<br>
BUDDY: That. That's it. Look! <br>
ALICE: You haven't been listening to a word I've been saying, have you?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Love the gal though I did, her
stories did tend to blur one into the next. It was always about the
craziness of that old coot, Mimsy Loyne, yadda, yadda, yadda. But this
morning I had found something worthwhile to distract me. Whoo hoo hoo,
was it worthwhile. But how had the authorities missed this? Where were
they? How could this thing just be sitting here?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: What is it?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Hissing, crackling,
half-submerged in the churned up topsoil, there was a meteorite in
Central Park. It was still cooling down. No one had noticed it. That
was crazy! It was as big as a man's head, glowing green. How come no
one had seen where the thing had landed?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Oh, my goodness. That's what we saw land,
isn't it? Last night. And it's just been waiting here, like we were the
ones meant to find it.<br>
BUDDY: Huh? Alice, keep back. We don't know what it is. It could be
some goofy government thing, or some crazy weapon. Alice?<br>
ALICE: It's okay. I just know it's gonna be okay.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Much as I adored her, Alice
never could listen and take instructions. Just then I had some sympathy
with her employer, cos she wasn't listening to a word I said, and went
stumbling across the grass and through the trees, closer and closer to
the strange meteor.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: It wants me. Buddy, can you hear it? It,
it's singing to me.<br>
BUDDY: Damn it, Alice, meteors can't sing. Alice!&nbsp; No, no,
don't touch that thing.<br>
(Fizz. Alice squeals.)<br>
ALICE: Oh, oh, whoa.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: I hurried over to where she'd
been blown by that brief explosion. Was she even alive? Her body was
glowing. It was giving off this kind of radiation. Her eyes were
closed, but she wasn't burnt, she was golden. And then there was a
crashing through the trees. I hardly looked up, though I guessed that
someone had heard the noise and was standing there with me, but I
couldn't take my eyes off Alice.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: What did she do?<br>
BUDDY: Huh? Who are you?<br>
DOCTOR: Don't stand there making small talk, man, just tell me, what
did she do?<br>
MIKE: Doctor, this thing in the ground, it looks rather like a meteor.<br>
WIBBSEY: Exactly like on the cover of this comic book.<br>
BUDDY: Alice. Alice, can you stand? Look, she's waking up. Alice, we
gotta get out of here.<br>
DOCTOR: Did she touch that piece of rock? Tell me.<br>
BUDDY: I guess she did. I tried to warn her.<br>
DOCTOR: That was a very foolish thing to do. Here, let me see.<br>
ALICE: Oh, no! No, get away from me. Don't let him come near me, Buddy.<br>
BUDDY: What's that? Alice, you're okay. You're all right. <br>
ALICE: Make him go away, Buddy.<br>
BUDDY: Listen, fella.<br>
DOCTOR: Doctor.<br>
BUDDY: Right, whatever you are, just keep away from us.<br>
MIKE: She's glowing gold. Can't you see? Something dreadful has
happened to your girlfriend.<br>
WIBBSEY: As I keep saying, just like the cover of that comic book.<br>
BUDDY: What are you talking about, lady?<br>
WIBBSEY: Any minute now, she's going to start flinging laser bolts out
of her eyes and hands, nearly killing us all.<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you might be right. Perhaps we should er, back away.<br>
BUDDY: Laser bolts? Now listen, you jokers.<br>
DOCTOR: Doctor.<br>
(Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.)<br>
BUDDY: Alice, honey, what are you doing?<br>
ALICE: Ah, whoa! I can't control it, Buddy. I can't stop it.<br>
(More whooshes under dialogue.)<br>
DOCTOR: Oh dear.<br>
MIKE: Can't you help her, Doctor?<br>
WIBBSEY: She's beyond help, that's what it says here. Possessed by an
alien life force, Alice Trefusis is destined to become Miss Starfall,
America's hottest new superheroine!<br>
MIKE: And we witnessed it.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's just fantastical hyperbole. However, something has
undoubtedly happened to her.<br>
BUDDY: Alice? Alice? Please stop!<br>
ALICE: Can't you see, Buddy? I've been reborn. I'm someone new now. I'm
no longer a spineless, nervous little secretary. Now I am a ooooh (thud)<br>
BUDDY: She's passed out.<br>
WIBBSEY: I'm not at all surprised.<br>
DOCTOR: I think you'd better get her indoors. She'll have attracted
attention, flinging lightning about like that.<br>
MIKE: What about the meteorite?<br>
DOCTOR: We'd better take it somewhere safe. Give me your jacket, Mike,
to wrap it in.<br>
MIKE: What about yours?<br>
DOCTOR: Don't be ridiculous, I've got all my things in it.<br>
MIKE: Oh.<br>
WIBBSEY: Oh, for heaven's sake. You men. Just pick the thing up.<br>
DOCTOR: Not with your bare hands, Mrs Wibbsey! We don't want you
running around with superpowers as well.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Superpowers? Did you all hear
what the Doctor said? Somehow he knew what was happening to my Alice in
the wilder reaches of Central Park that afternoon in July. He knew the
untold cosmic energies that were coursing through the veins and blood
vessels of my girl.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Oh. Oh. Buddy? I feel so strange.<br>
BUDDY: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to get you indoors. You'll be okay. You
were firing laser blasts! (hysterical laughter)<br>
ALICE: I need to get back to the Dakota Building. My lunch hour is up.
(faints)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: The Doctor was clutching the
strange meteor, wrapped in his friend's coat by now. Out of the corner
of my eye I saw him nod to his Mrs Wibbsey. She nodded back and moved
over to help me with Alice. We carried my beloved over the hills,
through the trees, back to the honking traffic and city noise of Eighth
Avenue.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: Is she always as light as this?<br>
BUDDY: There's something wrong with her, isn't there? The way she was
glowing before?<br>
WIBBSEY: I'm sure she'll be all right after a rest.<br>
BUDDY: Superpowers. You guys were talking about some kind of comic book.<br>
WIBBSEY: Just ignore us. The important thing is to get Alice back home.<br>
BUDDY: It isn't her home. She's got a room up there in that fancy
apartment building. She lives with a monstrous old dame name of Mimsy
Loyne.<br>
WIBBSEY: Not the famous movie star? From the talkies?<br>
BUDDY: Talkies? Geez, lady, which year did you step out of?<br>
WIBBSEY: 1932, as it happens, via the twenty first century, AD 46 and
1894. But you needn't bother about that. Let's concentrate on getting
this girl to safety.<br>
BUDDY: Cool.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: This woman may have been crazy,
but I was glad I had her help carrying Alice over the road and into the
Dakota. We attracted some pretty suspicious looks, toting an
unconscious girl about the place. In the elevator, we prepared
ourselves to face the wrath of Mimsy Loyne. Meanwhile, back in Central
Park, the Doctor and his companion Mike Yates were carrying the
mysterious meteorite into their Time spacecraft, the Tardis. Hold on,
you're thinking. Time spacecraft? Well, sure, I never knew all this
till later, when they gave me the lowdown on what they'd been up to.
Even now, after all the events of those few days, I still find it hard
to believe that this Doctor fella had a spaceship hidden away in the
Park, right next to the statue of Alice in Wonderland. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Drilling noise.)<br>
MIKE: What are you going to do?<br>
DOCTOR: Analyse it, Mike. It seems a rather strange sort of meteorite
to me. I'd like to know a little more about it. These slivers of rock
I'm fetching off are fascinating.<br>
MIKE: Are you sure you're up to this? You still don't look well to me.<br>
DOCTOR: I certainly feel a bit more chipper now I'm back in the Tardis.<br>
MIKE: It couldn't be that meteor, could it, making you feel rotten? You
know, like Superman and Kryptonite.<br>
DOCTOR: It may have slipped your notice, Captain Yates, but I am not
Superman. Now, just let me concentrate. Proximity to the meteor isn't
affecting me now, is it?<br>
MIKE: I think I should go after Mrs Wibbsey. I don't like us being
split up like this.<br>
(Cracking sound.)<br>
DOCTOR: Talking of splitting. Oh, well this whole thing suddenly sprung
open like a puzzle box. Oh. And there's something inside.<br>
MIKE: Careful, it looks hot. Here, use these tweezers.<br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Well, well, well.<br>
MIKE: What on Earth is it?<br>
DOCTOR: Unless my eyes deceive me, it's half a golden heart. I wonder
where the other half is?<br>
MIKE: It's beautiful.<br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. Pass me that magnifying glass, would you? There seems to
be some lettering stamped in the gold.<br>
MIKE: Oh, that'll be the hallmark. 24 carat, is it?<br>
DOCTOR: Shh. S E P U L.<br>
MIKE: Sepul? Mmm, new one on me. I used to be quite good with gold
marks. My sister works in a <br>
DOCTOR: Shh, shh, shh. Mike, do you remember what the Demon said to me
last time we met, when I asked where it wanted to take me so badly?<br>
MIKE: It said it wanted to take you to. Ah, my memory's terrible these
days. What was it now?<br>
DOCTOR: It was Sepulchre, Mike, the first five letters of which are<br>
BOTH: S E P U L!<br>
DOCTOR: Come on! <br>
MIKE: Where are we going?<br>
DOCTOR: We should never have let Mrs Wibbsey wander off like that.
She's got a wonderful nose for danger, that woman.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: But they hadn't gone far from
the Tardis before they found something grisly, hidden in some of the
Park undergrowth.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIKE: Urgh! Doctor.<br>
DOCTOR: What is it, Mike? Oh. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: It was the body of a man. Looked
like it had been savaged pretty brutally. I'm sorry to say there was
nothing specially new in that, not in New York, but although the fella
had been a young man, there was a weird leathery look to the flesh, as
if it had been freeze-dried.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: (groans) This is very bad news, Mike. Oh! <br>
(Police sirens approach.)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Then, all of a sudden, the
police finally arrived, alerted by the weird noises and light show.
They came crashing through the undergrowth and looked pretty startled
to see these two guys talking calmly in English accents while standing
over a mutilated corpse.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Oh dear.<br>
MIKE: Officers, we can explain.<br>
COP: I bet you can, sir.<br>
DOCTOR: Look here, gentlemen, you don't seriously think this has got
anything to do with us, do you?<br>
MIKE: Doctor, are you all right?<br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) It's that feeling again.<br>
COP: Get the cuffs, Driscoll.<br>
DOCTOR: We were out for a stroll, weren't we, Mike. <br>
MIKE: Yes. A lovely day for it.<br>
DOCTOR: I mean, I, I wouldn't blame you for thinking I, I look fishy but<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Like any good cops would, they
grabbed the Doctor and Mike, cuffed them, and bundled them into their
patrol car. I only heard about this later, of course. Just then I was
having a hard time of my own, because, up on the sixth floor of the
Dakota Building, I was coming face to face with the woman I'd heard so
much about in recent weeks. My girl's fiercesome employer.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: Ooo, Mimsy Loyne. May I just say what an
honour it is to meet you.<br>
MIMSY: No, you may not. Who the hell are you, coming in here
unannounced? And what have you done to my secretary?<br>
WIBBSEY: She had a funny turn in the Park.<br>
MIMSY: Is she drunk? She looks it.<br>
BUDDY: Mrs Wibbsey, would you help me to lie her down? Where's her
room, Miss Loyne?<br>
MIMSY: You, you're the pathetic boyfriend, aren't you? The one who
sells nuts in the street. I've seen her mooning after you.<br>
BUDDY: My name's Buddy, ma'am. Alice really needs to rest. Something
strange has happened to her.<br>
MIMSY: Strange? What's wrong with her?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: I was in no mood to entertain
the old broad with tales of what we'd been up to. I wasn't too
impressed with her imperious manner. Her luxurious pad, with its high
ceilings and fancy ornamentations didn't phase me either. All I cared
about was getting Alice comfortable. With a disgusted sigh, the ancient
movie star waved us in the direction of what was supposed to be Alice's
room. In truth, it was a windowless cupboard. My girl was just waking
up.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Oh, I feel so strange, Buddy.<br>
WIBBSEY: Have you got any pain?<br>
ALICE: No. No, in fact I've never felt so amazing in my life. I feel
wonderful! <br>
(Police sirens outside.)<br>
BUDDY: I think you should rest.<br>
MIMSY [OC]: Hey, you, Buddy, or whatever your name is. The police are
going into the Park down there. I count three, four, five patrol cars.
Can I have a word with you, young man?<br>
WIBBSEY: I'll go and see what Miss Loyne wants.<br>
ALICE: Buddy? Buddy, what's happening to me? I don't even feel like the
same girl any more.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: I tried to comfort her in my
arms, but I knew she was right. She was changed. Something in that
crazy meteor had changed her completely. And then I saw that Mrs
Wibbsey had left something on the bed. A piece of paper she'd had
wadded up in her fist.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: What is it?<br>
BUDDY: It's that comic book she was talking about, or at least just the
cover.<br>
ALICE: Oh, you and your comic books.<br>
BUDDY: Oh, my gosh. She's right, you know. We're all in the picture.
But it's dated today. How can that be?<br>
ALICE: Is this you and your comic store friends having some kind of
joke? Let me see.<br>
BUDDY: This is <i>you</i>, Alice. It's the meteor, it's
them, and it's you and me in the Park.<br>
ALICE: Miss Starfall? Is that who I am? Is that what I've become?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: I stared into the eyes of my
wonderful girl. I could see she was scared, but the same time, excited.
Miss Starfall, the new superheroine on the block, transformed by the
rays of a mysterious meteor. Well, true believers, that's how it was.
It was that self-same afternoon in July that my girlfriend started to
fly! She began by levitating to the apartment ceiling.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Hey! Hey, I can control this. I've got
powers, Buddy. I've got actual, real, honest to goodness superpowers!<br>
BUDDY: Alice, honey, come down from there. <br>
ALICE: Oh my gosh, Buddy, look at me. Look at what I can, look at who
I'm becoming.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Well, what do you say when your
girl changes like this? A guy can only step back and marvel. Alice went
into a frenzy of activity. I stared amazed as she hunted through a
trunk in the hallway of the apartment. She was looking for something, a
feverish glint in her eye. The trunk contained old costumes and a reek
of mothballs.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: These are some of Mimsy's Hollywood relics,
Buddy. Her movie costumes, stolen from the sets of her pictures. She's
been dragging them out to help with her memoirs.<br>
BUDDY: That's very interesting, Alice, honey, but what's that<br>
ALICE: Oh, look! I knew it was here. Mimsy's Valkyrie costume.<br>
BUDDY: Oh, but that winged helmet and cape, they look just like<br>
ALICE: The ones on the cover of that comic book. Exactly. See? It's all
fate, Buddy. It was meant to be me who touched that meteorite, and who
gained these miraculous powers, because I'm the one who can lay her
hands on the Valkyrie outfit from Cecil B de Mille's disastrous Wagner
epic! <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: I watched amazed as Alice donned
the elaborate costume. Her superheroine costume. She looked just like
the real thing as she rose into the air with her cape streaming out
behind her.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Oh ho ho! Look at me, Buddy Hudson. I have
become Miss Starfall, just as the comic book says.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Meanwhile, Mrs Wibbsey, unaware
of any of these amazing events, was watching with Mimsy Loyne, her
favourite talkies glamour star, remember, at the living room window,
watching the police pouring into Central Park's western gates. They saw
the paramedics and their ambulance, the forensics guys.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIMSY: There's a body. Oh, I love a good murder,
don't you?<br>
WIBBSEY: Well, I'm not really ghoulish.<br>
MIMSY: Oh, don't be so uptight, Wibbsey, is it? There's nothing like a
good murder to get the heart pumping with excitement and intrigue. Oh,
and look, the police have already apprehended two very shady looking
suspects.<br>
WIBBSEY: Where? I can't see.<br>
MIMSY: There, look. <br>
WIBBSEY: Oh no! But that's the Doctor, and Mike.<br>
MIMSY: Mmm, they look pretty guilty to me. Friends of yours, Wibbsey?<br>
WIBBSEY: The Doctor's got a habit of being in the wrong place at the
wrong time. I've got to get after them. Buddy? Buddy, I need your help.<br>
BUDDY [OC]: What is it?<br>
MIMSY: Is Alice all right? I hope nothing untoward has gone on in my
apartment.<br>
BUDDY [OC]: That kind of depends on what you mean by untoward, Mimsy.<br>
MIMSY: Miss Loyne to you.<br>
BUDDY: Alice has flown out of the hall window.<br>
WIBBSEY: What?<br>
MIMSY: Narcotics. They brought drugs into my home.<br>
BUDDY: I don't mean she's tripping, Miss Loyne. This is for real.<br>
WIBBSEY: You mean she's actually flying?<br>
(Whoosh.)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Alice had never felt so free.
She soared and zoomed across midtown. She held her breath for the first
ten minute, it seemed like, and when at last she let it out, it was in
a great burst of laughter. Miss Starfall, as she now was, cartwheeled
through the canyons of the streets round Broadway, she tumbled through
the pulsing air above Times Square, all the while with the shouts of
pedestrians ringing in her ears.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Whee! Ha ha! Is it a bird? A plane? No, it's
Mimsy Loyne's literary secretary. Whoo hoo!<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: And all I could think about was
the way Alice used to gently scoff at me for my own collection of comic
books. She knew I read them every moment I could, as I stood at my
pretzel store. She knew of my deepest desire of all, of one day having
a story of my very own accepted by the Incredible Comics Company.
Sometimes she would read over the scrappy little stories I would write,
turning her expert eye on them. I knew they weren't any good really,
but she liked to encourage me.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Oh, Buddy, if you could see me now.<br>
(Whoosh!)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: But I could, although she was
just a dark speck on the horizon, zooming all over the place. Somehow,
I could imagine her, and hear her rush of ecstatic thoughts on her
maiden flight above New York City. In a way, I was her very own
narrator.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Whoo! Ha, ha. You can write my story, Buddy.
I'm your very own superheroine, and you could write my very own comic
book. Whoo!<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: And if I'd known she could hear
me with those superpowered ears, I'd have shouted back, I'll do it,
Alice! I'll write it for you! The Incredible Comics Company will have
to listen to me then. It was then that I looked again at the torn comic
book cover Mrs Wibbsey had had in her possession. I peered closer at
the credits at the bottom. Art by Hal Moushima, words by Hudson. That's
me, Buddy Hudson.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY: That's <i>me</i>, Mrs Wibbsey.<br>
WIBBSEY: Is it indeed. I should have known. This is one of our
anomalous artefacts.<br>
BUDDY: Your what?<br>
WIBBSEY: The reason we're here in the past.<br>
MIMSY: All right, I've had enough of this. Get out of my apartment!
Bring back my secretary! <br>
BUDDY: Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Alice. We've got to get after
Alice. She's never flown before.<br>
MIMSY: Well, when she comes back down to Earth, tell her from me she's
fired. Oh, I can't stand people who draw attention to themselves.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Just about that moment, Alice
was acquitting herself pretty well. She was a natural at flying about
the place. I needn't have worried. Already she had saved a toddler from
falling out of an apartment window. She'd prevented a robbery on 81st
and 8th, and she'd put out a fire in a bakery with a freezing blast of
super-breath. She was amazing! This was all second nature to her. Right
then it was the Doctor we should have been more worried about. Still
afflicted by this mysterious weakness, he wasn't in a good way. And
added to that, he and Mike Yates were stuck in the back of a patrol
car, wedged in Seventh Avenue traffic just below Times Square.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIKE: I have to say, Doctor, I'm not sure I do love
New York after all. I certainly won't if we end up in a police cell.<br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't look very promising, does it. You know, Mike, on
every stage of this chase through Time, there has been a spate of
unexplained murders. Very nasty.<br>
MIKE: Think it's all linked, do you? The Park, Frau Herz's hotel, Paris.<br>
DOCTOR: A pattern is forming. A mosaic, if you like, laid down by a
single entity, drawing us further into its game.<br>
MIKE: It's hardly a game when so much death is involved.<br>
DOCTOR: This creature has no respect for human life. What are a few
bystanders to it? Nothing. Nothing, apart from oh, sustenance, perhaps.
Lifeforce. <br>
MIKE: What are you getting at?<br>
DOCTOR: I think our demon, whatever it is, needs to feed off living
energy in order to keep doing what it is doing, moving about in Time,
using that primitive dematerialisation chamber, and altering its
appearance to suit each new environment.<br>
MIKE: Like a chameleon.<br>
DOCTOR: Or a chimera, Mike. A deadly potpourri of physiognomies and
DNA. It could be anyone.<br>
MIKE: I think you should rest, Doctor. You're looking exhausted.<br>
DOCTOR: This isn't at all like me. I never tire in this way. Some
external force is affecting me. It keeps coming and going, like oh,
thunder.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: It sure was sweltering and
sticky in the patrol car, and because of the snarl-up in the traffic,
they weren't moving anywhere. One of the cops up front rolled down his
window, and that was when they started hearing all the cries and shouts
on the streets. Something about a flying dame. A girl was swooping
about in the skies above the Seventh Avenue theatres and delis. Now
everyone was looking up and yelling about it.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Whooshes and applause.)<br>
MIKE: Oh, my goodness, look! It's that girl.<br>
DOCTOR: She seems to have recovered remarkably well.<br>
MIKE: Looks as if you were right, Doctor, about that comic book and her
destiny.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: The cops in front were startled
to see that Miss Starfall had come right down to Earth, to land
gracefully right in front of their stationary patrol car. They dashed
out to confront this amazing looking woman in her silver cape and
boots, her winged helmet and her gleaming golden bustier. My girl Alice
looked great. Arms folded across her chest, she very calmly demanded
that the cops release her friends out of their custody.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: That's very kind of you, but really, I have
everything under control. Miss Starfall, isn't it?<br>
ALICE: So it says on that weird comic book of yours.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Of course, the cops didn't take
kindly to this cocktail chatter. They refused to release anyone, and
looked set to arrest Miss Starfall too, for causing ructions in a busy
street. That was when lasers shot out of Alice's eyes and melted their
handguns.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: Ooo, that's pretty good.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: While the cops dealt with their
shock, my brave girl wasted no time in grabbing hold of both the Doctor
and Mike's hands.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIKE: Oh, no. You're not taking me anywhere. I'm
not flying, especially in handcuffs.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Mike. You'll love it. Ready when you are, Miss
Starfall.<br>
MIKE: Are you sure you're well enough for this, Doctor?<br>
ALICE: Oh, hold on tight, gentlemen. <br>
(Whoosh!)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Somehow she just knew she'd be
able to take the weight of the two guys. Right then, my girl seemed
pretty sure she was capable of anything. Across town, at that very
moment, her erstwhile employer, Mimsy Loyne, was convulsed on her
chaise longue, and not through fulminating about the loss of a decent
secretary. The strange old harpy was convulsed with laughter. But how
come?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIMSY: (laughing) Don't you see, Buddy? Don't you
see that everything is going precisely to plan?<br>
BUDDY: Whose plan would that be exactly, Miss Loyne?<br>
MIMSY: Oh, this is all quite, quite delicious.<br>
WIBBSEY: Wait a minute. Look. <br>
(Footsteps on the staircase.)<br>
WIBBSEY: Oh, he's gone.<br>
BUDDY: Who'd you see?<br>
WIBBSEY: It was the Doctor, coming up the stairs.<br>
BUDDY: Are you sure?<br>
WIBBSEY: Who else wears a scarf like that?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: We ran down to the next level,
just in time to see the elevator doors closing. Mrs Wibbsey looked back
towards the stairs and then gave a loud cry. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: Doctor! There he is again.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: This time we both saw a flash of
scarf above our heads.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: He must be going up to Mimsy's apartment.
Come on. Doctor! <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Weird thing was, when we got
back to Mimsy's floor, all we saw was a glimpse of a coat and scarf
scuttling away around the corner.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: What's he playing at, the ridiculous man.
Why would he run away from me?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: I happened at that moment to
peer over the bannister and saw, yeah, you guessed it, another hat and
scarf coming up this way, and then another, and another.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY: Er, Mrs Wibbsey? There seems to be more than
one Doctor. Suddenly it's like a medical conference in here.<br>
WIBBSEY: I see what you mean. He's not going to be very pleased about
this. Someone's been running up copies of this clothes.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: We drew back into the unlit
shadows of the landing, and watched these figures climb the stairs and
brush past us, their scarves dragging along the carpet after them. We
couldn't see their faces, those wide-brimmed hats were pulled down so
low, but it was obvious by now that none of them was the Doctor.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: Come on, let's follow them.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Now, I told you I was a writer,
yeah? Well, I got a good instinct for a story, and to me this seemed
like a safe bet.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: But why dress up like the Doctor? What
does it mean?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Without being seen, we followed
the eerie, silent, ascending figures to a doorway on the top landing.
We watched them open the door onto darkness, and file inside.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: (sniffing) Can you smell that?<br>
BUDDY: Yeah. What is that? Something strange, coming out of that room.<br>
WIBBSEY: Jelly babies.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Meanwhile, true believers, Mimsy
Loyne was still staring out of a window at Central Park, and let me
tell you, she was feeling pretty pleased with how things were working
out better than she could ever have planned. If you or I could have
been there and seen her raddled face twisted with triumph, we'd have
been in no doubt that she was the genius in command of the day's
bizarre events. And how pleased she looked now, as the figure of Miss
Starfall came swimming through the hot July skies towards the Dakota
Building, carrying with her the Doctor and Mike Yates, secured only by
means of the Doctor's enormous scarf. This was, of course, the <i>real</i>
Doctor. The definite article. He sure was enjoying himself as he flew
over the Park with his coat flying out behind him like a cape, even
despite the weakness that sapped his very soul and the headache that
was raging inside his skull. Incredibly, he was enjoying this crazy
flight over the city.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Whoosh!)<br>
DOCTOR: What do you think, Mike?<br>
MIKE: I, I haven't opened my eyes yet.<br>
DOCTOR: (laughs) If we fell now, we'd be dashed to bits. Is that a
skating rink down there?<br>
MIKE: Don't! <br>
DOCTOR: She's very good, isn't she, considering she's just gained her
powers. I say you're very good at this.<br>
ALICE: Thank you.<br>
DOCTOR: Marvellous.<br>
MIKE: Has the fresh air revived you, Doctor?<br>
DOCTOR: A little. But on the whole I do still feel rather odd.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIMSY: Fool. But I think at last we may have him in
our grasp.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: As you know, I wasn't there, but
Alice told me later on this was pretty much how things panned out. Miss
Starfall brought the Doctor and Mike to Mimsy's tall window on the
sixth floor (breaking glass) and with one delicate superpowered flick,
she kicked the glass in.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIMSY: What in Heaven's name are you doing, girl?
Haven't you caused enough disturbance here today? I dismiss you from my
employ. Leave me at once.<br>
ALICE: Only too glad, Mimsy, but not before I introduce you to some
guests who are very keen to see you.<br>
MIKE: (groaning) Let me sit down. The room's still swaying. <br>
DOCTOR: So here we are, in the boudoir of Mimsy Loyne, the not so
silent film star. Hello there, dearie. How are you?<br>
MIMSY: How dare you come crashing in here?<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dearie, should we have sent our card up first? Would you
mind if I sat down as well? I'm feeling a bit off-colour today.<br>
MIKE: Doctor.<br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Oh, suddenly it's much worse, Mike. I feel drained of
all energy. This must be near the epicentre.<br>
MIMSY: What are you whispering about, huh? Don't make yourselves too
comfortable. You know, you really shouldn't have come here at all.<br>
DOCTOR: Quite right. The police, who are currently under the
misapprehension that Mike and I are murderers capable of reducing a
man's body to a husk, will track us back here before long. We must
hurry about our business.<br>
ALICE: And what exactly is your business, Doctor?<br>
DOCTOR: Something very murky, to do with demons, Alice. Dead bodies,
curious objects, and awful, awful demons. And I wouldn't mind betting
this strange ailment of mine is mixed up in it all as well, eh, Mimsy
Loyne?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Let's leave that on a close-up
of the Doctor's intently staring eyes, and cut straight to Mrs Wibbsey
and me, still outside that room on the highest floor of the Dakota. The
attic space, in fact. We're listening at the door, and we can hear
chanting from inside.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Whispering) <br>
WIBBSEY: Sounds to me like black magic. Some kind of cult.<br>
BUDDY: With everyone dressed up as the Doctor? We gotta get in there
and have a look.<br>
WIBBSEY: I think you're enjoying this.<br>
BUDDY: Do you know how boring it is selling pretzels? And anyway, my
girlfriend's got superpowers. How much danger can I get into? <br>
(Door creaks open.)<br>
BUDDY: Right, we're in. Shh. They're too absorbed in their rituals to
notice us. thank goodness.<br>
WIBBSEY: I can hardly take it in. It's a room full of Doctors.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: It sure was. Or wannabes, at
least, swirling round in a circle like they were at some kind of
Satanic barn dance. Solemn faces and shadows flickering in the
candlelight, There were hats and scarves everywhere, as the members of
the cult moved round in procession.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: What's that thing in the middle of the
room, on that sort of altar?<br>
BUDDY: I dunno. We'll have to get closer.<br>
WIBBSEY: It's glowing. Look, it's some kind of electronic device.
They're worshipping it.<br>
BUDDY: Hey, a gizmo.<br>
WIBBSEY: (loud) It's the last bit of the Doctor's spatial geometer from
the Tardis! <br>
BUDDY: I think we've been spotted.<br>
CULTIST: Keep the chant going. Do not let the sacred words fade. Cos
hoc tear pen, Cos har rite pen. Now amana missis quo. Quo mars hanna
aram. Betor bainga. Betor betingo. Yet factor hit. Fat deity ho. Fat
deity ho.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: And without breaking another
line in their weird litany, they all just started advancing on us.
Meanwhile, several storeys below, the real Doctor was facing up to his
own problems.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Mimsy Loyne. Ah, Mimsy, Mimsy, don't you
remember me?<br>
MIKE: You know this woman, Doctor?<br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, of course. Did I never tell you?<br>
ALICE: Miss Loyne, where's Buddy? I left him here with you.<br>
MIMSY: I wonder that you dare to show your face in here after showing
me up, flying all around the place, smashing my windows on your way
back in. You're already all over the TV news.<br>
ALICE: I am?<br>
MIMSY: Oh, you surely don't imagine that after this you can remain in
my employ?<br>
DOCTOR: Possibly you'll have to renegotiate terms, but I imagine her
shorthand is second to none and oh, her typing speed will be marvellous.<br>
MIMSY: You keep out of this.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, charming. You weren't like that back in 1922.<br>
MIMSY: Oh, I didn't know you in 1922.<br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps I looked a little different then, you certainly did,
but it was still me, Mimsy. We shared something very special on Sunset
Boulevard.<br>
MIKE: Really, Doctor?<br>
ALICE: Where is Buddy, Miss Loyne? If you tell me, I promise I will
never darken your door, or, or kick in your windows ever again.<br>
MIMSY: He left a little while ago with that old English fruitcake.<br>
DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey has gone?<br>
MIMSY: Mmm, they left together.<br>
ALICE: I'm going to look for Buddy.<br>
MIMSY: What are you gonna do, stand in the Park and holler?<br>
ALICE: Oh, you forget, Miss Loyne. I have got superpowers now. X-ray
vision, superhearing. I know the sound of Buddy's heart, his every
breath. I will find him! <br>
DOCTOR: Good for you! And when you do, and if Mrs Wibbsey is with him,
would you let her know we've escaped the police, and that we're here
having nice cup of tea with my old, very old flame, Mimsy Loyne.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Alice was filled with new
purpose. She strode out of that luxurious apartment as if she never
intended on going back. Her whole hideous life of enslavement to that
mean-minded superstar was over at last.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIKE: (sotto) Doctor, you said when we were in that
police car that you thought there was an entity at work here. The same
one you faced in Paris and in the Alps. The same thing was responsible
for the murder in Central Park.<br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Yes, Mike, I do detect the hand of an unknown being at
work. Something that can disguise itself. As I said, a chimera.<br>
MIMSY: I couldn't help overhearing. I'm so relieved to hear that you
know about it too. Now that Alice is gone, I can talk freely. You don't
know what it's been like in recent months. I've been a prisoner here.
Not her, me. That girl, she's a monster, even before that weird
accident.<br>
MIKE: You mean Alice is?<br>
MIMSY: Yes, Alice, my literary secretary. That's why she suddenly had
superpowers. She's made herself insanely powerful. She wants to take
over the world.<br>
MIKE: Calm down, Miss Loyne.<br>
MIMSY: You don't know what it's been like.<br>
MIKE: Try us. Tell us.<br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Shh. You're too trusting, Mike. This woman could wind
you round her withered little thumb. Can't you see? She's manipulating
us, or trying to.<br>
MIKE: I think she's genuinely upset.<br>
MIMSY: Of course I am. I'm just a poor, defenceless old woman. That
girl's kept me here a prisoner.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Mimsy, really, you were always a terrible liar, as I
remember all too well to my own cost. Why, back in 1922<br>
MIMSY: Need you go raking up the past, Doctor? I was a young girl then.
Perhaps I hurt you, but I didn't mean to.<br>
DOCTOR: So you do remember?<br>
MIMSY: And I apologise from the bottom of my heart.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, how very interesting.<br>
MIKE: See, Doctor? I think she's genuine. Please, tell us about Alice.
You say that there's more to her, even before her miraculous
transformation?<br>
MIMSY: That's what I'm trying to say, young man.<br>
MIKE: Ooo, it's been a while since I was called that.<br>
MIMSY: You're remarkably well-preserved, Mister Yates, wasn't it?<br>
DOCTOR: She's a flatterer. Don't listen, Mike.<br>
MIMSY: Oh, that girl, she isn't even human. I have an inkling that, oh,
it sounds ridiculous, I feel that she is in reality some kind of alien
intelligence.<br>
DOCTOR: In disguise?<br>
MIMSY: Yes, of course in disguise.<br>
DOCTOR: Now whatever could make you say that?<br>
MIMSY: Sometimes the mask slips.<br>
DOCTOR: Yes, they tend to do that, don't they?<br>
MIMSY: Some nights, in the dark and the quiet of my apartment, I can
hear her, and she's talking to someone. Not someone human, and she
isn't on the phone. I can hear voices talking back. Strange hissing
voices. She is consorting with devils. Or demons.<br>
MIKE: What do you think, Doctor?<br>
DOCTOR: I think she's a good actress. But you always were, weren't you,
Mimsy Loyne? You were the original Femme Fatale. You could make us
believe anything.<br>
MIMSY: I'm not lying. My secretary is in league with some kind of
terrible power, something not of this Earth.<br>
MIKE: Having seen what I've seen today, that makes sense to me.<br>
DOCTOR: It makes a kind of sense, but I don't think our murderous demon
intends to take over <i>this</i> world. I don't believe it
has any such lofty ambition.<br>
MIKE: Then what? What does it want?<br>
DOCTOR: I thought at first it was simply revelling in the chaos it
could cause. It has some time travel capability. I thought it was
simply enjoying itself, spinning through Time and causing these
anomalies, murdering and destroying and stealing life energy from its
victims, and then changing history, dropping clues.<br>
MIMSY: Oh, this is beyond me. Alice has been travelling in Time?<br>
DOCTOR: Our demon has been zig-zagging through history and, if it
doesn't sound too egotistical, I think it's all to do with me.<br>
MIKE: You mean it's been tracking you down?<br>
DOCTOR: Almost precisely the opposite, Mike. It's been luring me,
drawing me on, making me think that <i>I</i> am tracking <i>it</i>.<br>
MIKE: I see.<br>
DOCTOR: Yeah.<br>
MIKE: What about this life energy that you said that it needs. You
don't suppose the demon's found some way to drain it from you?<br>
DOCTOR: It's a possibility. I'll tell you what, though. Tea is a
marvellous refreshment, isn't it? Didn't you promise us some tea, Mimsy?<br>
MIMSY: I'm afraid I am without staff today.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's all right. Put the kettle on, Mike.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: So who was the wiliest of these
two clever old souls? Mimsy Loyne was perched like a dreadful raven on
her chaise longue, eyeing the Doctor suspiciously. Meanwhile, his eyes
were wandering around the walls, peering intently at her movie posters
and memorabilia.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Do you really remember our little dalliance
back in the 1920s, my dear?<br>
MIMSY: Oh, Doctor. How could you even ask? Who could ever forget about
you?<br>
DOCTOR: Darling Mimsy.<br>
MIKE [OC]: Where do you keep the tea things?<br>
MIMSY: I've no idea, young man. You were very special to me, Doctor,
then and now.<br>
DOCTOR: Was I? Am I?<br>
MIMSY: You know it's true.<br>
DOCTOR: Then it's my great pleasure to tell you that actually, Mimsy,
there was no primrose path dalliance. I wasn't there in your past. I
was lying.<br>
MIMSY: What! <br>
DOCTOR: And so, you are lying, Mimsy, except you're not really Mimsy at
all, are you. Not in the slightest bit.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Close-up on Mimsy's shocked
expression. The Doctor had tricked her. There was fury in her eyes,
blazing red, demonic red. Slowly, she stood and raised herself to her
full height. Mike Yates wasn't there to witness this, but I can see it
all in my mind's eye. The Doctor gives a great gasp of pain. He cries
out as he slips to his knees, and the film star laughs out loud at his
predicament, a shrieking, wicked laugh.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIMSY: (laughing) You may think you've uncovered
the truth, Doctor. It doesn't matter. You're at my mercy. You're
helpless as a kitten before me, aren't you.<br>
DOCTOR: Never. I'll resist you with every jot of my remaining life
force.<br>
MIMSY: Huh. I could snuff you out like a candle, but of course I
wouldn't dream of it. Not when I need you so badly.<br>
DOCTOR: You do? What for?<br>
MIMSY: You're in great demand, Doctor. Now shush. Just lie there, my
dear Doctor, while I go and make last minute preparations. By the time
I get back, you'll be as good as knocked out, and not even your
Captain's tea will revive you. Bwahahahahahaha!<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Cut to full page spread of the
crazy dressed up cultists in the dusty attic. Mrs Wibbsey and I had
been effortlessly overpowered and tied up with, what else, incredibly
long, multi-coloured scarves. I tried to put my dukes up and fight 'em
off, of course, and Mrs Wibbsey kicked a few shins, but we were
overpowered by sheer force of numbers.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Chanting continues.)<br>
WIBBSEY: What are you lot playing at? You must know the Doctor and what
he's like. You know he'll come after and rescue us.<br>
BUDDY: It's no use trying to reason with them, Mrs Wibbsey. These guys
are all brainwashed. They look like a bunch of hoodlums and punks off
of the street. But who's paid them to get up in this crazy way?<br>
CULTIST: Enough of the lip, skinny-dip. Just button it and keep still.<br>
WIBBSEY: You can't keep us prisoner up here. We haven't done anything. <br>
CULTIST: Shaddap, lady. You've defiled our sacred space. Ain't it
enough?<br>
WIBBSEY: But why are you all dressed up as the Doctor? Are you out of
your minds?<br>
CULTIST: We got our instructions. We're doing important work here.<br>
WIBBSEY: Oh yes? Worshipping a mechanical implement and spouting
gibberish?<br>
CULTIST: It may look like that to you, but there's a little more to it
than that.<br>
BUDDY: Geez, Mrs Wibbsey, this really is one of them crazy cults. They
probably all think they're going to the stars. These kind of nuts don't
think twice about taking human life.<br>
CULTIST: You said it, son. Sacrifice, murder, it's all the same to me,
so long as you're out of our way.<br>
WIBBSEY: You can't! Just because we interrupted your ghastly ceremony?<br>
BUDDY: Hey, fella? For what it's worth, you've scared us enough. Just
let us go, okay? We won't tell anyone what you guys are up to. We won't
even tell the Doctor.<br>
WIBBSEY: There they go again. Why are you worshipping the Doctor? He
isn't a god. He'd hate all of this, though the silly fool'd be
flattered as well.<br>
CULTIST: The Doctor's important, right? You know that, we know that.
Our boss knows that.<br>
WIBBSEY: Your boss?<br>
CULTIST: You don't think we're doing this for the kicks, do ya? But the
boss has to feed.<br>
BUDDY: You've lost me. I don't understand. Are you not, are you not
human or something?<br>
CULTIST: We're human, all right, but the boss? That's a different
matter.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Meanwhile, many storeys below in
the Dakota Building, Mike Yates had at last emerged from Mimsy's
kitchen with a tea tray, only to find the Doctor looking like death
warmed up on her Persian rug.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Crash of tea things!)<br>
MIKE: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: It's worse, Mike, whatever it is that's debilitating me.<br>
MIKE: Where's Mimsy gone?<br>
DOCTOR: She stormed out. She's not the Mimsy the world knows, you know.
Quick, help me up.<br>
MIKE: You're in no fit state.<br>
DOCTOR: We have to go after her. After them all.<br>
MIKE: But where?<br>
DOCTOR: To the source. To the source. To the epicentre. To the thing
that's draining my life force away.<br>
MIKE: Are you sure you can make it, Doctor?<br>
DOCTOR: I have to, Mike. If I don't, we're all doomed.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: You must stop this. Give the Doctor back
that piece of the spatial geometer. Put an end to the killings, and all
this bizarre business. Please.<br>
CULTIST: No can do, lady. The boss says we gotta keep up with the
killing and with the chanting. We got work to do.<br>
WIBBSEY: You foolish man, the Doctor will stop you.<br>
CULTIST: He's already lost.<br>
WIBBSEY: How's he lost? What do you mean?<br>
CULTIST: Lady, we haven't been dancing around this trinket cos it's
pretty. We've been doing it cos the boss says we have to. I dunno how
it works exactly, but the upshot is that as long as we all focus our
minds on him, and divert our mental energies into the box of tricks, we
neatly leech the old boy's life force. So long as we're in business up
here, he's helpless. We got the Doctor at our mercy.<br>
BUDDY: So that's what it was with the headaches and the nausea.<br>
WIBBSEY: Oh, my giddy aunt. I knew there was something amiss. He's
usually fit as a tick. And he's usually here by now. This terrible lot
have been doing voodoo on the poor man.<br>
CULTIST: Voodoo shmoodoo. The boss says it's science. So long as the
Doctor can't fight back, we're all happy. And he can't. He's finished,
Mrs Wibbsey.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Before the cultist guy could
gloat some more, the cavalry arrived. Or rather, one lone soldier in
the form of my brilliant, super-enhanced girlfriend. She had tracked me
down via my own skittering heartbeat. Imagine that. What it would be to
have hearing that powerful. So there she was, up in the attic and
kicking down the door.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Crash!)<br>
CULTIST: What the? Who are you?<br>
ALICE: The guy at the pretzel stall calls me Miss Starfall. And you are?<br>
WIBBSEY: They're a dreadful bunch of ne'erdowells.<br>
BUDDY: And they all need their butts kicked in a big bad way.<br>
ALICE: Oh ho, I'm only too happy to oblige.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: And that's precisely what she
did. Miss Starfall swung into action and became a blur of high-kicking
pins and karate-chopping arms. Oh, Alice! In that moment, I knew she
would be my muse and my heroine forever. The noise of this fracas
carried out onto the landings of the building below. Even on the
staircase, where just then Mike was helping the Doctor, half-carrying
him up the steps, they could hear the noise of the battle overhead.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIKE: It's coming from the top of the building.<br>
DOCTOR: That fits. The higher we go, the weaker I feel. We've got to
get up there, Mike.<br>
MIKE: Better not risk the lift if someone really is out to get us. I'll
have to carry you.<br>
DOCTOR: Just let me lean on you.<br>
MIKE: Doctor, you're not gonna make it.<br>
DOCTOR: I must. Whatever is doing this to me, I have to face it. I have
to face it. (faintly) I have to face it.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Up in the attic chamber, bodies
were falling by the wayside. Unconscious, you understand, not dead.
Those guys didn't have an ounce of muscle between them. They were just
hypnotised lackeys and street bums dragged in and dressed up by the
head of the cult. None of them stood any kind of chance against the
lithe and powerful Miss Starfall. With a surprising determination, Mrs
Wibbsey elbowed her own way into the battleground and over to the
make-shift altar. Next thing I knew, she was within a hair's breadth of
their holy of holies.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: Oh ho, ho, Doctor, you're going to be so
pleased.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: The leader of the cult was
beside himself with panic and fear. He wedged his bulk in between the
spatial geometer and the determined housekeeper, and stared in dismay
at his fallen men.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: Let me pass, man. Hand that component over
to me.<br>
CULTIST: Lady, I don't wanna hurt ya, but we gotta do what the boss
tells us.<br>
WIBBSEY: You're really scared of this boss chap, aren't you.<br>
MIMSY: And so he should be, Mrs Wibbsey. So he should be.<br>
WIBBSEY: Mimsy? What are you doing up here?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Star of stage and screen, Miss
Loyne had made her entrance into the attic compartment. She slunk into
that room like she was walking onto the set of some old movie.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIMSY: Who has attacked my poor, precious boys?<br>
WIBBSEY: Did you know these men were cavorting like this at the top of
your building?<br>
MIMSY: Know it? They're on my payroll, honey.<br>
ALICE: She's mixed up in this, Mrs Wibbsey. Look at her. They were
working for her.<br>
BUDDY: She's the boss, the one he was so scared of.<br>
CULTIST: Forgive us, Mimsy.<br>
WIBBSEY: Hang on a minute. Mimsy Loyne the film star in charge of a
space age cult? You sure about that?<br>
MIMSY: You'd be surprised, Mrs Wibbsey, to learn of some of the things
I've been in my long history.<br>
WIBBSEY: What does that mean?<br>
(Door opens.)<br>
DOCTOR: It means that we've met her before, Mrs Wibbsey.<br>
WIBBSEY: Oh, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: We've met this ghastly person again and again throughout Time.
No Mimsy she, I'm afraid. Has somebody stopped singing?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Suddenly, the Doctor was like a
changed man, bright eyed and bushy tailed, no longer afflicted with the
mysterious weakness.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: Oh, Doctor, you're better.<br>
DOCTOR: Much. The energy force sapping my strength suddenly disappeared
half way up the stairs. Something to do with these fellows on the
floor, was it?<br>
WIBBSEY: Yes, they'd rigged themselves up to the spatial geometer.<br>
MIKE: What?<br>
WIBBSEY: That's what this one said. They were doing some kind of weird
ju-ju magic with it, and draining the life out of the Doctor.<br>
DOCTOR: I imagine Mimsy here has used dimensional geometrics to rig up
a primitive telepath debilitator, am I right or am I right?<br>
MIMSY: Ah, I bet you were top of the class back in kindergarten,
weren't you, Doctor. Well, have a gold star, sugar.<br>
DOCTOR: Don't sugar me, honey. I didn't do too badly, as it happened.
And I haven't done too badly today, either. Even if I was put out of
action for a little while, I had my friends to rally round.<br>
BUDDY: And now we're all here together, like a super team! <br>
MIMSY: You all make me sick. But no matter. I've got everything I need.
The telepath debilitator served its purpose.<br>
DOCTOR: Which was?<br>
MIMSY: Why, to incapacitate you until preparation here could be
completed, which they now are, so I can dispense with this ridiculous
disguise.<br>
DOCTOR: Quite right. Feel free to slip into something a little more
comfortable. What about your horns and wings and cloven hoofs, eh,
sugar?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Suddenly, Mimsy was ripping out
of her silk dressing gown and a pair of great jagged purple wings were
sprouting out of her back! Believe me, there were horns curling round
out of her skull, and a forked tongue flickered out of her mouth. And
the worst thing of all? She was laughing. Laughing at us all.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Very fetching, my dear.<br>
MIKE: So it really is the same entity.<br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, she's been all of them, haven't you, demon?<br>
MIMSY: Emperor Claudius, the widowed concierge, the Ice Queen.<br>
ALICE: You haven't won, whoever you are, whatever you say you are. I'm
here to stop you.<br>
MIMSY: (laughs) Stupid girl. You're part of it too. My plan, my
wonderful plan. That meteor was no accident, nor was your finding it.
You became Miss Starfall simply to play a role in this drama which I
devised, the final element of which was a comic book cover with today's
date on it. An irresistible puzzle that the time travellers came back
to investigate.<br>
ALICE: So you're a comic book artist as well as a monster?<br>
DOCTOR: She's a shape-changing demon, and she's worn umpteen faces in
recent times, each one of them for the same purpose. To kidnap me.<br>
ALICE: She said I was part of the plan. What plan? What does she want?<br>
MIMSY: Only the Doctor. The rest of you are irrelevant.<br>
DOCTOR: Ah, you see, that's where the likes of you always make a
mistake. You fixate on the object of your desire, and while he's
helpless and weak and under your thumb, you're so busy gloating that
you take your eye off the other people. People like Mike Yates over
there, for instance, having just overpowered your chief lackey there
and tied him up with his own scarf while we've been talking. Mike is
just about, if I'm not mistaken, to reclaim the crucial element of my
spatial geometer for me. Well done, Mike. <br>
MIKE: Got it! It's a pleasure, Doctor.<br>
MIMSY: You know, Doctor, you might be right. That's an interesting
idea. Perhaps your pitiable friends do have more value than we
realised. (laughs)<br>
ALICE: Watch out, she's up to something. Look! <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Suddenly, Mimsy grabbed Mrs
Wibbsey by her upper arms and started dragging her away towards a small
door in the far corner of the room. The Doctor's housekeeper struggled
ferociously, but by now some of the cultists had started to come round,
and they got up to help Mimsy hold her. I was yelling out no, leave her
alone, she's just a feeble old woman. Mrs Wibbsey didn't look very
pleased at that either.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Demon, don't you dare hurt my Wibbsey.<br>
MIMSY: I think we can up the stakes in this little game of ours,
Doctor, and take it all to the next level. Congratulations on
recovering all the elements of your Tardis's spatial geometer. You're
going to need them. You see, Mrs Wibbsey and I are going on a journey
now.<br>
MIKE: Let her go, you animal! <br>
WIBBSEY: Help me, Doctor. Don't let her take me.<br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, Wibbs, the demon won't harm you. It can't. It
needs me on side.<br>
MIMSY: Are you sure, Doctor? Would you be so reckless with your
housekeeper's life? What does she matter to you anyway?<br>
WIBBSEY: Doctor, please. Oh! <br>
DOCTOR: Grit your teeth, Wibbs.<br>
MIKE: Doctor, where's the creature taking her?<br>
(Demon Mimsy's laughter fades away.)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: That question was soon answered.
The Doctor seemed to be weighing up possibilities, unsure of the best
course of action. As the rest of us hovered and dithered, looking for a
way in to help her, Mrs Wibbsey was bundled away. The small door at the
end of the room sprang open at Mimsy's touch. A weird green glow came
emanating from within. <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIBBSEY: No! Oh, no!<br>
BUDDY: Doctor, what is it?<br>
DOCTOR: It's a dematerialisation chamber. Think of it as the demon's
yellow cab.<br>
MIKE: We've got to stop them, Doctor. <br>
MIMSY: Come any closer, and I'll kill her.<br>
DOCTOR: And if we let you get away?<br>
MIMSY: You'll see, Doctor. You'll see. My chickens will come home to
roost.<br>
DOCTOR: Balderdash! <br>
MIMSY: Remember, Doctor, the Sepulchre is prepared for you!
Bwahahahahaha!<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: Alice, sorry, Miss Starfall,
wasn't taking any of that nonsense. She surged forward and knocked out
the last standing cultist with a killer blow. But even she was too
late. Just at that moment, Mimsy and Mrs Wibbsey vanished behind the
heavy door.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALICE: I can't budge it, Buddy. It's stuck.<br>
BUDDY: Wait, it's glowing. Something's happening! <br>
DOCTOR: Get back from there. Don't touch that door! There's nothing we
can do now.<br>
MIKE: Oh, no.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
BUDDY: What's it doing to her in there?<br>
ALICE: It's going to blow up.<br>
(Wibbly dematerialisation sound.)<br>
ALICE: (gasps) Oh, it's gone! There's nothing there but a wall.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: She was right. Alice, the
Doctor, Mike and I were left standing in a room full of unconscious
cultists, and no one else at all.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIKE: Mrs Wibbsey, she's gone.<br>
DOCTOR: We'll find her, Mike.<br>
MIKE: How?<br>
DOCTOR: It's what the demon wants. There has to be a clue. There just
has to be another clue. What did the demon say just then?<br>
MIKE: The Sepulchre is prepared.<br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Remember the inscription on the half of the heart, Mike?<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: The Doctor looked grimly
determined as he led the way downstairs and out of the Dakota Building,
back to Central Park and that strange blue craft of his.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Time for us to return to Nest Cottage,
Mike, to retrench and draw up plans.<br>
BUDDY: Hey, Doctor, you taking us with you?<br>
DOCTOR: You and Alice must stay in New York, Buddy.<br>
ALICE: Of course. I've got a job to do here.<br>
BUDDY: She's right. You're right, Alice, honey. This city needs a
heroine like you.<br>
DOCTOR: Ah yes, well, you see, there might be a problem with that.<br>
ALICE: Problem?<br>
BUDDY: She won't be harmed, will she? I mean, that meteorite won't<br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid that Alice's powers will fade, slowly but inevitably.<br>
ALICE: Oh. Oh no.<br>
DOCTOR: They were bestowed on you only temporarily, my dear. That
meteorite was planted in your path by the demon. Your powers were just
another part of its games. My guess is that the meteor came from its
unearthly abode, flung down to Earth for you to find. It was a
distraction, nothing more. The effects will soon wear off.<br>
MIKE: Are you sure, Doctor? I mean, you don't want to be leaving this
girl running around with superpowers.<br>
ALICE: I'm kinda disappointed to hear all that, Doctor. How long before
they fade? How long before I go back to being just normal again?<br>
BUDDY: Alice, you'll never be normal to me.<br>
ALICE: Oh, gee, thanks.<br>
BUDDY: No, what I mean is, I'll love you whether you can shoot laser
bolts or not.<br>
DOCTOR: It will be a matter of hours, I think. I've observed this
creature's powers at work. The demon's energy fades away when its
attention moves on, and it'll be elsewhere.<br>
ALICE: Then I guess we'd better fly, Buddy.<br>
BUDDY: Huh?<br>
ALICE: Before my gift fades away. If you want me to fly you over the
city?<br>
BUDDY: Sure. One last trip round the island.<br>
MIKE: Oh, do be careful, both of you.<br>
BUDDY: Hey, it's research for the comic book. Alice may lose her true
powers, but in the stories I'll write about her, she'll be fabulous
forever!<br>
ALICE: Hold on tight, buddy. Bye, Doctor. Bye, Mike.<br>
BUDDY: See you in the funny pages, guys. <br>
(Whoosh!)<br>
MIKE: So, what now, Doctor? Where do we even start looking for poor Mrs
Wibbsey?<br>
DOCTOR: We've got a lot of work to do, but we'll find her, you can be
sure of that. The hunt is on, Mike, and the game's afoot.<br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.)<br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BUDDY [narrating]: So, true believers, that was the
end of our run-in with the mysterious Doctor, back then in the
summertime of 1976. He was off in the blink of an eye. off into who
knows what kind of adventures, as he went in pursuit of poor, lost Mrs
Wibbsey. So remember, be sure to buy Incredible Comics for more amazing
adventures with the astounding Miss Starfall.<br>
