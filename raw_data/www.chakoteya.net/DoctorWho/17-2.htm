sky. The spherical spaceship sits on three legs, looking very out of
place.) <br>
JAGAROTH [OC]: Twenty soneds to warp thrust. <br>
SCAROTH: Confirmed. <br>
JAGAROTH [OC]: Thrust against planet's surface set to power three. <br>
SCAROTH: Negative. Power three too severe. <br>
JAGAROTH [OC]: Scaroth, it must be power three. It must be. <br>
SCAROTH: Warp thrust from planet's surface is untested. At power three
it is suicide. Advised. <br>
(The pilot is covered in little green worms for skin, and has one eye
high in its face.) <br>
JAGAROTH [OC]: Ten soneds to warp thrust. <br>
SCAROTH: Advise! <br>
JAGAROTH [OC]: The Jagaroth are in your hands. Without secondary
engines we must use our main warp thrust. You know this, Scaroth. It is
our only hope. You are our only hope. <br>
SCAROTH: And I am the only one directly in warp field. I know the
dangers. <br>
JAGAROTH [OC]: Three, two, one. <br>
SCAROTH: What will happen if <br>
JAGAROTH [OC]: Full power! <br>
(The centre of the spaceship starts to spin, then it begins to lift off
from the dead planet. The three landing legs tuck themselves in.
Suddenly, space seems to warp within the spaceship.) <br>
JAGAROTH [OC]: Help us, Scaroth! Help us! The fate of the Jagaroth is
with you! Help us! Scaroth, you are our only hope! Our only hope! Help
us! Scaroth! Scaroth! The Jagaroth! The Jagaroth! <br>

DOCTOR: Nice, isn't it? <br>
ROMANA: Yes, marvellous. <br>
DOCTOR: Marvellous. Absolutely. <br>
ROMANA: Absolutely marvellous. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I think it's marvellous. <br>
ROMANA: So do I. Though it's not quite as you described it. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? How did I describe it? <br>
ROMANA: You said it was nice. <br>
DOCTOR: It's the only place in the world where one can relax entirely. <br>
ROMANA: Mmm. That bouquet. <br>
DOCTOR: What Paris has, it has an ethos, a life. It has <br>
ROMANA: A bouquet? <br>
DOCTOR: A spirit all of its own. Like a wine, It has <br>
ROMANA: A bouquet. <br>
DOCTOR: It has a bouquet. Yes. Like a good wine. You have to choose one
of the vintage years, of course. <br>
ROMANA: What year is this? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah well, yes. It's 1979 actually. More of a table wine, shall
we say. Ha! The randomiser's a useful device but it lacks true
discrimination. Should we sip it and see? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I'd be delighted. Shall we take the lift or fly? <br>
DOCTOR: Let's not be ostentatious. <br>
ROMANA: All right. Let's fly then. <br>

ROMANA: Philosophically. <br>

KERENSKY: But I can proceed no further, Count. Research costs money. If
you want results, we must have the money. <br>
SCARLIONI: I assure you, Professor, money is no problem. <br>
KERENSKY: So you tell me, Count Scarlioni. So you tell me everyday.
Money is no problem. Look, what you want me to do about these equipment
invoices? Write no problem on them and send them back? <br>
SCARLIONI: Will a million francs ease the immediate cash-flow
situation? <br>
(He hands over a wad of Francs Nouveau. We are still over 20 years from
the Euro, remember.) <br>
KERENSKY: Yes, Count. That will help admirably. But I will shortly need
a great deal more. <br>
SCARLIONI: Yes, of course, Professor, of course. Nothing must stand in
the way of the work. <br>
(A black clad man with a white beard enters.) <br>
HERMANN: Your Excellency? <br>
SCARLIONI: Ah, Hermann. That Gainsborough didn't fetch enough. I think
we'll have to sell one of the Bibles. <br>
HERMANN: Sir? <br>
SCARLIONI: Yes, the Gutenberg. <br>
HERMANN: May I suggest we tread more carefully, sir? It would not be in
our best interest to draw too much attention to ourselves. Another rash
of priceless treasures on the market could <br>
SCARLIONI: Yes, I know, Hermann. I know. Just sell it discreetly. <br>
HERMANN: Discreetly, sir? Sell a Gutenberg Bible discreetly? <br>
SCARLIONI: Well, as discreetly as possible. Just do it, will you? <br>
HERMANN: Yes, sir. Of course, sir. <br>

SCARLIONI: Good, Professor. Excellent. I hope we are now ready to start
the next test on the equipment? <br>

DOCTOR: For a portrait of a Time Lady, that's not at all a bad
likeness. <br>
(It's a cracked clock face at ten to two, wearing a straw boater.) <br>
ROMANA: That's extraordinary. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, isn't it. <br>

fractured. <br>

SCARLIONI: Time, time, time. Nevertheless, a very impressive, if
flawed, demonstration. I'm relying upon you to make very fast progress
now, Professor. The fate of many people is in our hands. <br>
KERENSKY: The world will have much to thank you for. <br>

DOCTOR: I think there's a matter with time. Didn't you feel anything? <br>
ROMANA: Mmm, just a twinge. I didn't like it. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It must be because I've crossed the time fields so often.
No one there seemed to notice anything. You and I exist in a special
relationship to time, you know. Perpetual outsiders. <br>
ROMANA: Don't be so portentous. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? What do you make of that, then? <br>
ROMANA: Well, at least on Gallifrey we can capture a good likeness.
Computers can draw. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Computer pictures? You sit in Paris and talk of computer
pictures? Listen, I'll take you somewhere and show you some real
paintings painted by real people. <br>

collapsing into Catherine's lap. She rolls him onto the floor as she

here. <br>
COUNTESS: Good, Hermann. Show them in. <br>
HERMANN: Yes, my lady. <br>

the room by Hermann, at gun point. He falls onto the carpet. Romana and
Duggan walk in unaided) <br>
DOCTOR: I say, what a wonderful butler. He's so violent. Hello, I'm
called the Doctor. That's Romana, that's Duggan. You must be the
Countess Scarlioni and this is clearly a delightful Louis Quinze chair.
May I sit in it? I say, haven't they worn well? Thank you, Hermann,
that'll be all. <br>
COUNTESS: Doctor, you're being very pleasant with me. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm a very pleasant fellow. <br>
COUNTESS: But I didn't invite you here for social reasons. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I could see that the moment you didn't invite me to have a
drink. Well, I will have a drink now you come to mention it. Yes, do
come in, everybody. <br>
(The Doctor gets up and goes to the decanter and glasses on a side
table and pours.) <br>
DOCTOR: Romana, sit down over there. Duggan. Now, Duggan, you sit
there. Do sit down if you want to, Count. Oh, all right. Now, isn't
this nice? <br>
COUNTESS: The only reason you were brought here was to explain exactly
why you stole my bracelet. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, it's my job, you see. I'm a thief. And this is
Romana, she's my accomplice. And this is Duggan. He's the detective
who's been kind enough to catch me. That's his job. You see, our two
lines of work dovetail beautifully. <br>
COUNTESS: Very interesting. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
COUNTESS: I was rather under the impression that Mister Duggan was
following me. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Well, you're a beautiful woman, probably, and Duggan was
trying to summon up the courage to ask you out to dinner, weren't you,
Duggan? <br>
COUNTESS: Who sent you? <br>
DOCTOR: Who sent me what? <br>
COUNTESS: Doctor, the more you try to convince me that you're a fool,
the more I'm likely to think otherwise. Now, it would only be the work
of a moment to have you killed. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
COUNTESS: Put it down. <br>
(Romana has picked up the box.) <br>
ROMANA: It's one of those isn't it? <br>
COUNTESS: Yes, it's a very rare and precious Chinese puzzle box. You
won't be able to open it so put it down. <br>
(Romana opens it and takes out the green bracelet.) <br>
ROMANA: Oh, look. <br>
SCARLIONI: Yes. Very pretty, isn't it. <br>
ROMANA: Very. Where's it from? <br>
SCARLIONI: From? It's not from anywhere. It's mine. <br>
(Scarlioni takes the bracelet from Romana.) <br>
COUNTESS: My dear, these are the people who stole it from me at the
Louvre. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello there. <br>
SCARLIONI: How very curious. Two thieves enter the Louvre gallery and
come out with a bracelet. Couldn't you think of anything more
interesting to steal? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I just thought it was awfully pretty and a terribly
unusual design. Of course, it would have been much nicer to have stolen
one of the pictures, but I've tried that before and all sorts of alarms
go off which disturbs the concentration. <br>
SCARLIONI: Yes, it would. So you stole the bracelet simply because it's
pretty? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I think it is. Don't you? <br>
SCARLIONI: Yes. <br>
COUNTESS: My dear, I don't think he's as stupid as he seems. <br>
SCARLIONI: My dear, nobody could be as stupid as he seems. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
SCARLIONI: This interview is at an end. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Well, we'll be off. A quick stagger up the Champs
Elysees, perhaps a bite at Maxims. What do you think, Romana? <br>
ROMANA: Maxims <br>
SCARLIONI: I think a rather better idea would be if Hermann were to
lock you into the cellar. I should hate to lose contact with such
fascinating people. <br>
(Hermann moves forward, and Duggan picks up the chair he was sitting in
to hit him with it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Duggan, what are you doing? For heavens sake, that's a
Louis Quinze. <br>
DUGGAN: But you're not going to let them lock us up <br>
DOCTOR: Just behave like a civilised guest. I do beg your pardon,
Count. <br>
SCARLIONI: Thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Hermann, if you'd just be kind enough to show us to our
cellar, we'd be terribly grateful. Do come along, my good chap. <br>

HERMANN: Two hours, maybe three. <br>
DOCTOR: What happens after that? <br>
HERMANN: After that, you won't need any light. <br>

The noise of the computers in the lab is quite loud.) <br>
DUGGAN: What do you think you're playing at? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Light the lamp. <br>
DUGGAN: There's only one match. <br>
DOCTOR: Then get it right. <br>
DUGGAN: You tell me to get it right? We could have escaped at least
twice if you hadn't <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly, exactly. What's the point of coming all the way here
just to escape immediately? What we do is, we stay here. <br>
DUGGAN: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: Let them think they've got us safe. <br>
DUGGAN: Yes? <br>

Doctor tries his sonic screwdriver on the door.) <br>
DUGGAN: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: It's not working. <br>
DUGGAN: Oh, you and your stupid ideas. <br>
(Duggan hits the door lock with the screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't! <br>
DUGGAN: Well, what else use is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It was useful against the Daleks on Skaro. <br>
DUGGAN: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you wouldn't remember. Never mind. <br>
DUGGAN: That's all I need. Locked in a cellar, no way out, and two

ROMANA: The horizontal length of the stairs is about six metres, isn't
it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose so. Why? <br>
ROMANA: Well, this room runs alongside the stairs, and it's only two

DUGGAN: Right, let's get out of here. <br>
DOCTOR: No. There are bound to be a couple of guards at the top of the

DUGGAN: Exactly. I'm about ready to thump somebody. <br>
DOCTOR: I want to look at the lab first. <br>
DUGGAN: What use is looking at the lab? <br>
DOCTOR: In the last few hours I've been thumped, threatened, abducted
and imprisoned. I've found a piece of equipment which is not of Earth
technology and I've been through two time slips. I think this lab might
have something to do with it. <br>
DUGGAN: Cut that stuff out, will you? What about the Mona Lisa? <br>
DOCTOR: What about it? <br>
DUGGAN: Do you reckon the Count and Countess are out to steal it? <br>
(Romana carries some equipment into the cellar.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
DUGGAN: I don't know about you, but I'm going to stop them. <br>
DOCTOR: They're not going to steal it at five o'clock in the afternoon,
are they? <br>
DUGGAN: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Because the Louvre is still open. <br>
DUGGAN: Oh, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, while we're here, why don't you and I find out how they're
going to steal it and why. Or are you just in it for the thumping? <br>
DUGGAN: I'm in it mainly to protect the interests of the art dealers
who employ <br>
DOCTOR: I know, but mainly for the thumping. What do you think Romana's
up to? <br>
DUGGAN: I don't know. <br>
DOCTOR: Nor do I. Looks intriguing, don't you think? <br>
DUGGAN: I don't care. I'm going. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
(Duggan starts up the stairs but the door at the top opens and
Professor Kerensky enters, comes down and goes into another area out of
sight. He returns wearing his glasses and goes to the time slip
apparatus. The Doctor and Duggan watch from behind a pillars, while
Romana is inside the cellar. Kerensky then gets an egg from a cabinet
and places it in the middle of the apparatus. He checks some notes
while the Doctor stops Duggan from attacking him, then starts up the
apparatus. In the glow of the beams, the egg hatches and the chick
grows into a chicken in mere seconds.) <br>
DOCTOR: Which came first, the chicken or the egg? <br>
KERENSKY: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: Me? <br>
KERENSKY: Yes, who are you? What are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: Me? I'm the Doctor. What you're doing is terribly interesting,

I hope you'll agree. It makes the impossible, possible. <br>
(The equipment is a box with a rectangular light on the front,
semicircular grills sticking out of the sides and a switch on the top.)
<br>
SCARLIONI: Perhaps the Professor should see it. I should like him to
know that while he is no doubt a genius, the man he is working for is
altogether more clever. <br>
HERMANN: Without question, sir. Shall I go and fetch the Professor,

SCARLIONI: Yes. Ah, no. No, I would not disturb the work. Besides, I
don't think our Professor would be very amused. Are we ready? <br>

DOCTOR: Well, you're tinkering with time. That's always a bad idea
unless you know what you're doing. <br>
KERENSKY: I know what I'm doing. I am the foremost authority on
temporal theory in the whole world. <br>
DOCTOR: The whole world? <br>
KERENSKY: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's a very small place when you consider the size of
the universe. <br>
KERENSKY: Ah, but who can? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, some can. And if you can't, you shouldn't tinker with time.
<br>
KERENSKY: But you saw it work. The greatest achievement of the human
race. A cellular accelerator. You saw it! An egg developed into a
chicken in thirty seconds. With a large one, I can turn a calf into a
cow in even less time. It will be the end of famine in the world. <br>
DOCTOR: It'll be the end of you, if you're not careful, never mind the
cow. Look. <br>
(The skeletal remains of the chicken collapse into a heap.) <br>
KERENSKY: Well, there are a few technical problems. <br>
DOCTOR: A few technical problems! No, no, no. The whole principle
you're working on is wrong. You can stretch time backwards or forwards
within that bubble, but you can't break into it or out of it. It's true
you have created a different time continuum, but it's totally
incompatible with ours. <br>
KERENSKY: Ah. I don't know what you mean. <br>
DOCTOR: Have you tried this? <br>
(The Doctor reverses a control on the wall. The bones reassemble into a
chicken which then shrinks back into its egg.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's a more interesting effect, don't you think? Did you know
when you built that it could do something like that? <br>
KERENSKY: No. What did you do? <br>
DOCTOR: What do you mean, what did I do? I just reversed the polarity.
This is very expensive equipment, isn't it? <br>
KERENSKY: Oh, very expensive. The Count is very generous. A true
philanthropist. I do not ask too many questions. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you'd. What's your name? <br>
KERENSKY: Kerensky. <br>
DOCTOR: Kerensky? <br>
KERENSKY: Theodore Nikolai Kerensky. <br>
DOCTOR: Theodore Nikolai Kerensky, a scientist's job is to ask
questions. You should <br>

skin like lots of worms. Then it vanishes completely. Duggan hits
Kerensky on the back of the head.) <br>
DOCTOR: Theodore. Theo. Kerensky! He's fainted. <br>
DUGGAN: No, I hit him. Now, can we stop wondering about conjuring
tricks with chickens and get out of this place? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's your philosophy, isn't it. If it moves, hit it.
He's going to be all right. If you do that one more time, Duggan, I'm
going to take very, very severe measures. <br>
DUGGAN: Yeah? Like what? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm going to ask you not to. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
ROMANA: I was right. <br>
DOCTOR: About what? <br>
ROMANA: Those measurements. There's another room behind the wall,
bricked up. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, four to five hundred years. <br>
DUGGAN: In which case it can wait another hour or two while we sort
these guys out. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. In my view, a room that's been bricked up for four
or five hundred years is urgently overdue for an airing. <br>

projected from the box the Count has made.) <br>
SCARLIONI: So, there is the problem. A box constructed of steel and
plate glass, but merely a physical barrier to protect the painting from
attack. We cut through the glass with the aid of our sonic knife. <br>
(Hermann does so. Henchmen stick handles on and take the glass away.
Four red vertical lights appear in the gap.) <br>
SCARLIONI: Now wait. We now come to the second and far more interesting
line of defence. The laser beams. Interrupt them, and every alarm in
Paris will go off instantly. To get through them, we must alter the
refractive index of the very air itself. Hermann. <br>
HERMANN: Sir. <br>
(Herman switches on a second device and the laser beams bend sharply to
the left.) <br>
SCARLIONI: A prismatic beam now deflects the beams and the picture is
accessible. <br>
(The Count applauds as the henchmen remove the painting from the wall.
Then he removes the bracelet from the projector and the room returns to
its normal appearance.) <br>
SCARLIONI: A useful little device. Wear it always. <br>

DOCTOR: He seems to be financing some dangerous experiment with time.
The professor, of course, thinks he's breeding chickens. <br>
DUGGAN: Stealing the Mona Lisa to pay for chickens? <br>
ROMANA: Yes, but who'd want to buy the Mona Lisa? You can hardly show
it if it's known to be stolen. <br>
DUGGAN: There are at least seven people in my address book who'd pay
millions for that picture for their private collection. <br>
ROMANA: But no one could even know they'd got it! <br>
DUGGAN: It would be an expensive gloat, but they'd buy it. <br>

DOCTOR: It's the Mona Lisa. <br>
DUGGAN: Must be a fake. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know what's hanging in the Louvre, but this is the
genuine article. <br>
DUGGAN: What? <br>
(The Doctor opens the door below. Another Mona Lisa. To the side,
another, below that, another. In total he uncovers six paintings.) <br>
DUGGAN: They must be fakes. <br>
DOCTOR: The brushwork's Leonardo's. <br>
DUGGAN: How can you tell? <br>
DOCTOR: It's as characteristic as a signature. The pigment, too. <br>
DUGGAN: On all of them? <br>
DOCTOR: Every one. What I don't understand is why a man who's got six
Mona Lisas wants to go to all the trouble of stealing a seventh. <br>
DUGGAN: Come on, Doctor, I've just told you. There are seven people who
would buy the Mona Lisa in secret, but nobody's going to buy the Mona
Lisa when it's hanging in the Louvre! <br>
ROMANA: Of course. They'd each have to think they were buying the
stolen one. <br>
DUGGAN: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: I wouldn't make a very good criminal, would I? <br>
SCARLIONI: No. Good criminals don't get caught. I see you've found some

shall have a seventh. <br>

DOCTOR: Well, I do flit about a bit, you know. <br>
TANCREDI: Through time? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose so. <br>
TANCREDI: How, precisely? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. I don't seem to be able to help myself. There I
am, just walking along minding my own business and pop! I'm on a
different planet or even a different time. But enough of my problems.
What are you doing here? <br>
TANCREDI: I will tell you. The knowledge will be of little use to you,
since you will shortly die. I am the last of the Jagaroth. I am also
the saviour of the Jagaroth. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I mean, if you're the last of them, there can't be that
many about to save, can there? Jagaroth? <br>
TANCREDI: You've heard of us. <br>
DOCTOR: Jagaroth. I think it was on one of my trips. Yes, you all
destroyed yourself in some massive war. Wait, when. <br>
TANCREDI: Four hundred million years I think is the figure you're
looking for. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it really? How time passes. So what are you doing here? <br>
TANCREDI: Surviving. The prime motive of all species. We were not all
destroyed. A few of us escaped in a crippled spacecraft and made
planetfall in this world in its primeval time. We found it
uninhabitable. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, four hundred million years ago it would have been a
bit of a shambles. No life to tidy it up. No life. <br>
TANCREDI: We tried to leave but the ship disintegrated. I was
fractured. Splinters of my being are scattered in time. All identical,
none complete. I am not satisfied with your explanation. How do you
travel through time? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, as I was saying <br>
TANCREDI: What is that box? <br>
DOCTOR: What box? <br>
(Tancredi points over his shoulder to the Tardis, part hidden behind a
draped curtain.) <br>
TANCREDI: That box. <br>
DOCTOR: That box? I don't know. I've never seen that box in my life.
Ah! <br>
(He has spotted a portrait of a lady.) <br>
DOCTOR: The original, I presume? Completed in 1503 and it's now what,
1505, and you're getting the old boy to do you another six, yes, which
you then brick up in a cellar in Paris for Scarlioni to find in four
hundred and seventy four time. That's a very nice piece of capital
investment. <br>
TANCREDI: I can see that you are a dangerously clever man, Doctor. I
think it's time we conducted this conversation somewhat more formally. <br>

he wags his tongue, confiscate it. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. <br>

don't believe all that, do you? <br>

DOCTOR: Well, Jagaroth spaceships. Isn't it. Isn't it? <br>
SOLDIER: I'm paid simply to fight. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I mean, quite honestly, when you think about all
that Jagaroth spaceship. <br>
SOLDIER: When you work for the Borgias, you believe anything. <br>
DOCTOR: The Borgias? Yes, yes, I see your point. <br>
SOLDIER: As I said, I'm paid to fight. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. As I said, I see your point. <br>

soldier backs off a little, worried.) <br>

do it. There you are. <br>

with a nice uppercut to the jaw, catches him and puts him in the chair.
Then he gets a felt tip pen from his pocket and goes to a set of six

one face down then goes to the desk by the window to write a note.) <br>

damage. I was in the warp control cabin and when the explosion occurred
I was flung into the time vortex and split into twelve different parts
which lead, or have led, independent but connected lives in times in
this planet's history. Not a very satisfactory mode of existence. <br>
ROMANA: So you want to reunite yourself, yes? <br>

Was. And stop my original self from pressing the button. <br>
ROMANA: And you were hoping to do that with this lot? <br>
SCARLIONI: You underestimate the problems with which I was faced. My
twelve various selves have been working throughout history to push
forward this miserably primitive race so that even this low level of
technology could be available to me now. <br>
ROMANA: But this won't work. Put yourself in that bubble and you would
either regress back to being a baby again or go forward to old age. <br>
SCARLIONI: I had worked out a way, but it would have taken rather too
long. Now, with your help, I shall be able to return with ease. Now,
build me a field interface stabiliser. Do it. <br>
ROMANA: All right, I'll help you. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: I'd like to make an appointment with Count
Scarlioni at his earliest convenience, if you don't mind, that is. <br>
(The Doctor backs into the room, facing a thug with a gun. He nearly
bumps into the maid.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, someone in authority. I wonder, would you be kind and tell
the Count that I wait upon him, please? There's a good girl. <br>
(The maid leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: The silent type, eh? I once knew a boy like you. Never said a
word, very taciturn. Well, I said to him, there's no point in talking
if you've got nothing to say. Did well in the end, though. Name of
Shakespeare. Ever read any Shakespeare? Countess? <br>
COUNTESS: A little. <br>
(She goes to the back of the room and tweaks the head of a statuette. A
panel in the wall slides up and she removes a leather bound volume from
the secret library.) <br>
COUNTESS: Hamlet. The first draft. <br>
DOCTOR: What? It's been missing for centuries. <br>
COUNTESS: It's quite genuine, I assure you. <br>
DOCTOR: I know. I recognise the handwriting. <br>
COUNTESS: Shakespeare's. <br>
DOCTOR: No, mine. He'd sprained his wrist writing sonnets. Wonderful
stuff. To be or not to be, that's the question. Whether tis nobler in
the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to
take arms against a sea of troubles and. Take arms against a sea of
troubles? That's a mixed. I told him that was a mixed metaphor and he
would insist. <br>
COUNTESS: Oh Doctor, I'm quite convinced that you're perfectly mad. <br>
DOCTOR: Only Nor-norwest. Nobody's perfect. If you think I'm mad
because I say I met Shakespeare, where do you think your precious Count
got that? <br>
COUNTESS: He's a collector. He has money and contacts. <br>
DOCTOR: Contacts? Human contacts? How much do you really know about
him, eh? I think rather less than you imagine. </font></p>

runs down the stairs.) <br>
HERMANN: Excellency! <br>
SCARLIONI: Don't tell me. The Doctor's here. <br>
HERMANN: Why, yes, sir. So I've only just been told by the maid. <br>
SCARLIONI: I knew it. Bring him down here. <br>
HERMANN: Yes, sir. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Drawing room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: How long have you been married to the
Count? <br>
COUNTESS: Long enough. <br>
DOCTOR: Long enough. I like that. Discretion and charm. So civilised.
So terribly unhelpful. <br>
COUNTESS: Discretion and charm. I couldn't live without it, especially
in matters concerning the Count. <br>
DOCTOR: There is such a thing as discretion. There's also such a thing
as wilful blindness. <br>
COUNTESS: Blind? I help him to steal the Mona Lisa, the greatest crime
in the century, and you call me blind? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! You see the Count as a master criminal, an art dealer, an
insanely wealthy man, and you'd like to see yourself as his consort.
But what's he doing in the cellar? <br>
COUNTESS: Tinkering. Every man must have his hobby. <br>
DOCTOR: Man? Are you sure of that? A man with one eye and green skin,
eh? Ransacking the art treasures of history to help him make a machine
to reunite him with his people, the Jagaroth, and you didn't notice
anything? How discreet, how charming. <br>
HERMANN: Excuse me, my lady. Doctor, the Count is very anxious to see
you in the cellar. <br>
DOCTOR: Think about it, Countess. Think about it. <br>
(The Countess laughs as the men leave, then becomes very serious. She
goes back to the library and takes out another book. This one is
hollow, containing parchments which she unfolds. One is a plan for a
pyramid, the other a diagram for an Egyptian wall painting of various
gods and pharaoh. The end figure has a green blob of a head, with one
eye.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Ah, Count. Hello. I wonder if you could
spare me a moment of your time. Romana, hello, how are you? I see the
Count's roped you in as a lab assistant. What are you making for him? A
model railway? Gallifreyan egg timer? I hope you're not making a time
machine. I shall be very angry. <br>
SCARLIONI: Doctor, how very nice to see you again. It seems like only
four hundred and seventy four since we last met. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed, indeed, yes. I so much prefer the weather in the early
part of the sixteenth century, don't you? Where's Duggan? <br>
(Duggan is locked in the cellar.) <br>
DUGGAN: Doctor, get me out of here. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, there you are, Duggan. Are you behaving yourself? Good,
good. Now, Count, this is what I've come to say. If you're thinking of
going back in time, you'd better forget it. <br>
SCARLIONI: And why do you say that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, because I'm going to stop you. <br>
SCARLIONI: Oh no, on the contrary, Doctor, you're going to help me. <br>
DOCTOR: I am? <br>
SCARLIONI: You are indeed. And if you do not, it'll be so much the
worse for you, for this young lady, and for thousands of other people I
could mention if I happened to have the Paris telephone directory on my
person. <br>
DOCTOR: Count, that sort of blackmail won't work because I know what
the consequences will be if you get what you wanted. I can't let you
fool about with time. <br>
SCARLIONI: What else do you ever do? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, I'm a professional. I know what I'm doing. I also
know what you're doing. Romana, put the equipment down. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, it's all right. He just wants to get back to his
spaceship and reunite himself. <br>
SCARLIONI: Doctor, I think we can dispense both with your interference
and with your help. Your friend has done her work very well indeed. <br>
DOCTOR: Count, do you realise what will happen if you try to go back to
the time before history began? <br>
SCARLIONI: Yes. Yes, I do. And I don't care one jot. Hermann. <br>
HERMANN: Sir. <br>
SCARLIONI: Lock them in the cellar. They shall stay long enough to
watch my departure. <br>
HERMANN: Yes, sir. <br>
SCARLIONI: After that, kill them in whatever way takes your fancy. <br>
HERMANN: Very good, sir. <br>
SCARLIONI: I must say my farewells to the Countess. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Countess is waiting for him, holding a
pistol) <br>
SCARLIONI: My dear? <br>
COUNTESS: Close the door. Now, what are you? <br>
SCARLIONI: I beg your pardon? <br>
COUNTESS: What have I been living with all these years? Where are you
from and what do you want? <br>
SCARLIONI: If I may answer those questions in reverse order, what I
want is a drink. Will you have one? <br>
COUNTESS: Stay away! Put it down! Now, who are you? <br>
SCARLIONI: I am Scaroth. <br>
COUNTESS: Scaroth? <br>
SCARLIONI: Last of the Jagaroth. It has not been difficult keeping
secrets from you, my dear. A few fur coats, a few trinkets, a little
nefarious excitement. <br>
COUNTESS: What are the Jagaroth? <br>
SCARLIONI: The Jagaroth. An infinitely old race and an infinitely
superior one. I shall show you what you want to know, my dear. <br>
(Scarlioni pulls off the latex mask. The Countess drops the pistol in
horror.) <br>
SCAROTH: I am Scaroth. Through me, my people will live again. I'd glad
to see you are still wearing the bracelet I designed for you, my dear.
It is, as I said, a useful device. <br>
(Scaroth touches his signet ring and the Countess screams in agony
before falling to the floor.) <br>
SCAROTH: Goodbye, my dear. I'm sorry you had to die. But then, in a
short while you will have ceased ever to have existed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ROMANA: If I'd know I was helping the Jagaroth. <br>
DUGGAN: Jagaroth? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
DUGGAN: What's a Jagaroth? <br>
DOCTOR: They're not nice to know. <br>
ROMANA: So that's why he had to go back in time. He had to reverse
history in order to save the Jagaroth race, and I've made that
possible. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, without the stabiliser he only had the time bubble. <br>
DUGGAN: And he couldn't get into that. You saw what happened to the
Professor and the chicken. <br>
ROMANA: It doesn't travel in time, it just goes forwards or backwards
in its own lifecycle. If he'd got in it he'd just have become a baby
again. <br>
DOCTOR: What he was really trying to do was to put the whole world in
the bubble, like those tiny jumps in time when we first arrived. <br>
ROMANA: Of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Cracks in time. He shifted the whole world back in time for two
seconds, but what he really wanted to do was shift the whole world back
in time four hundred million years. <br>
ROMANA: But without the stabiliser, he couldn't have been there himself
to save his ship. Yeah, but how would he get the power? It would be
fantastic. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you think we've been chasing about for all this time? <br>
DUGGAN: The Mona Lisas. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. He couldn't have sold them anyway. <br>
DUGGAN: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, before Leonardo painted them, I wrote These are Fakes on
the blank board with felt tip. It would show up under any x-ray. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, there won't be any x-rays for it to show up on if he
gets back to that ship. <br>
DOCTOR: No, because you supplied him with the vital component he
needed. <br>
ROMANA: Wait a minute. When I made that component, I rigged it so that
it could only go back in time for two minutes. After that, he'd be
catapulted back to his own time, here. Now he couldn't do any harm. <br>
DOCTOR: One minute would be sufficient for him to go back in time,
contact his ship and prevent it exploding. He wouldn't then be
splintered in time and all history would be changed. <br>
ROMANA: We must do something to stop him. <br>
DOCTOR: I've got an idea. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: We'll ask Duggan. <br>
BOTH: Duggan? <br>
DUGGAN: Right, stand back again. <br>

SCAROTH: You now see me as I truly am. <br>
DOCTOR: Very pretty. <br>
SCAROTH: And you will see the culmination of my live's work. <br>
DOCTOR: How very fulfilling for you. <br>
SCAROTH: For thousands upon thousands of years my various splintered
selves have been working for this moment, and now, with the aid of this
device, so kindly supplied by the young lady, I shall be able to make
this equipment into a fully operational machine. I'm well aware of the
limitations you have built into it, my dear. They will not affect the
outcome. I shall return to my spaceship the moment before it exploded
and stop myself from pressing the button. You will not be able to read
the settings on the dial, Doctor. They will explode as soon as
activated. <br>
(Scaroth switches on and puts down the pistol.) <br>
SCAROTH: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>

DUGGAN: Well, that's got rid of that, then. I need a drink. <br>

DUGGAN: Where to? <br>
ROMANA: Four hundred million years ago. <br>
DUGGAN: Where? <br>

CLEESE: To me, one of the most curious things about this piece is its
wonderful afunctionalism. <br>
ELEANOR: Yes, I see what you mean. Divorced from its function and seen
purely as a piece of art, its structure of line and colour is curiously
counterpointed by the redundant vestiges of its function. <br>
CLEESE: And since it has no call to be here, the art lies in the fact
that it is here. <br>

ROMANA: Where's the Count? <br>

DOCTOR: The amniotic fluid from which all life on Earth will spring,
where the amino acids fuse to form minute cells. Cells which eventually
evolve into vegetable and animal life. You, Duggan. <br>
(The Doctor taps some of the sludge into Duggan's hand, and throws the
rest back into the pool.) <br>
DUGGAN: I come from that, that soup? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, not that soup exactly. It's inert. There's no life
in it yet. It's waiting on a massive dose of radiation. <br>
ROMANA: The Jagaroth ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. The explosion that caused Scarlioni to splinter in time
also caused the birth of the human race, and that's what's about to
happen. The birth of life itself. <br>
DUGGAN: Here, while we watch? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, if we were watching we'd be in dead trouble. We've got
to stop Scaroth. <br>

SCAROTH: Stop! Stop, my brothers! In the names of the lives of all of
us, stop! <br>

SCAROTH: Keep out of my way. I must get to the ship. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Scaroth, you can't. <br>
SCAROTH: I'm in that ship. I'm in the warp control cabin. I must stop
myself pressing the button. <br>
DOCTOR: No, Scaroth, no. You've pressed it once. You've thrown the dice
once. You don't get a second throw. <br>
SCAROTH: But I will splinter in time again, and all my people will be
killed! <br>
DOCTOR: No! The explosion that you in there are about to trigger off
will give birth to the human race. The moment your race kills itself,
another is born. That has happened. It will happen. <br>
SCAROTH: What do I care of the human race? Scum! The tools of my
salvation. <br>
DOCTOR: No, the product of your destruction. History cannot change. It
cannot! <br>
