say? Uncle Soon called in, he says hello. He keeps saying, you must be
missing her. I said, she's been gone for over two years now, I'm
getting used to it. <br>

DOCTOR: Actually, chat's second on my list, the first being gun pointed
at my head. Which then puts my head second and chat third, I think.

MAGGIE: Better start planting some more if there's an extra mouth to
feed. <br>
ANDY: The very first garden off Earth. Everything brand new. Eden.
That's what we should've called this place. <br>
(He washes the carrots and takes a bite.) <br>
MAGGIE: It's the Philippines. I bet. If there's someone else on Mars,
it's got to be the Philippines. All those stories about them building a
rocket. Adelaide's going to love that. Stealing her thunder. Mind you,
worth it to see her face. <br>
(Behind her back, Andy starts jerking.)&nbsp;<br>
MAGGIE: Or it could be the Spanish. They kept that Spacelink project
under wraps. Didn't your sister work for them? Are you all right, mate?
Come on, stop mucking about. Andy? Are you okay? <br>

big cracks in it and water is dribbling out. Margaret screams.)

ADELAIDE: Seventeen months. <br>

MD. Nurse Yuri Kerenski. Senior Technician Steffi Ehrlich. Junior
Technician Roman Groom. Geologist Mia Bennett. You're only twenty seven
years old. <br>

ADELAIDE: As I said, Doctor, everyone knows our names. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, they'll never forget them. What's the date, today? What is
it? Tell me the exact date. <br>
ADELAIDE: November 21st, 2059. <br>

November 21 2059.) <br>

STEFFI: Is there something wrong? <br>
MIA: What's so important about my age? <br>
DOCTOR: I should go. I really should go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry with all
of my hearts, but it's one of those very rare times when I've got no
choice. It's been an honour. Seriously, a very great honour to meet you
all. The Martian pioneers. <br>

he pads Gadget instead.) <br>

ED: Maggie, if you want to meet the only new human being that you're
going to see in the next five years, better come take a look. <br>

MIA: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I really should go. <br>
ED: This is Central. Biodome report immediately. <br>

ED: Internal cameras are down. <br>

ADELAIDE: I'm going over. Doctor, with me. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm sorry. Er, I'd love to help, but I'm leaving right
now. <br>

Adelaide. But one thing they never said. Was it worth it, the mission? <br>
ADELAIDE: We've got excellent results from the soil analysis. <br>
DOCTOR: No, but all of it. Because they say you sacrificed everything.
Devoted your whole life to get here. <br>
ADELAIDE: It's been chaos back home. Forty long years. The climate, the
ozone, the oil apocalypse. We almost reached extinction. Then to fly
above that, to stand on a world with no smoke, where the only straight
line is the sunlight? Yes. It's worth it. <br>

woman with starlight in her soul. <br>

I bought it myself. Georg says it's the thought that counts. <br>

bulkhead, but not in time.) <br>

DOCTOR [memory]: I'm not just a Time Lord, I'm the Last of the Time
Lords. They'll never come back. Not now. I've got a Tardis. Same old
life, last of the Time Lords. And they died and took it all with them.
The walls of reality closed, the worlds were sealed, gone for ever. The
Time Lords kept their eye on everything. It's gone now. But they died,
the Time Lords! All of them, they died. I'm the last of the Time Lords.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Section F]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Mia, take this sealant, fix that leak.
Yuri, open emergency oxygen. Adelaide, don't just sit there. That's
better. The Dome's still got integrity! It's ten feet of
steel-combination, made in Liverpool. Magnificent workmanship. <br>
ADELAIDE: It can't be stopped. Don't die with us. <br>
DOCTOR: No, because someone told me just recently. They said I was
going to die. They said he will knock four times, and I think I know
what that means, and it doesn't mean right here, right now, because I
don't hear anyone knocking, do you? <br>
(Andy thumps three times on the bulkhead door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Three knocks is all you're getting. <br>
(He electrifies the bulkhead.) <br>
DOCTOR: Water and electricity, bad mix. Now then, what else have we
got? <br>
ADELAIDE: But there's no way to fight them. <br>
DOCTOR: Heat! They use water, so we can use heat. Works against the Ice
Warriors, works against the Flood. Ramp up the environment controls and
steam them. <br>
ADELAIDE: But you said we die. For the future, for the human race. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, because there are laws. There are Laws of Time. Once upon
a time there were people in charge of those laws, but they died. They
all died. Do you know who that leaves? Me! It's taken me all these
years to realise the Laws of Time are mine, and they will obey me! <br>
(Bang! Sparks! Alarms!) <br>
ADELAIDE: Environment controls are down. Sorry, Doctor, it looks like
history's got other ideas. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not beaten yet. I'll go outside, find the heat regulator. <br>
(His spacesuit helmet is damaged.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not beaten. Not beaten! You've got spacesuits in the next
section. <br>
(But water is pouring through the ceiling.) <br>
DOCTOR: We're not just fighting the Flood, we're fighting time itself.
And I'm going to
win! <br>
(Maggie is in the Water Extraction module. She emits a high pitched
noise and the glacier starts to crack.) <br>
YURI: Something is happening to the glacier. <br>
DOCTOR: Think-a think-a think-a think. What have we got? Not enough
oxygen. Protein packs, useless. Glacier, glacier mints, minty, Monty,
molto bene, bunny, bonny, bish bash bosh. Argh. The room, the room,
look at the room. Section F. What's in Section F? Anyone! <br>
YURI: Nothing. It's just storage. <br>
DOCTOR: Storing what? <br>
YURI: I don't know. Er, the weather spikes, the robots, the atom
clamps. <br>
DOCTOR: Atom clamps. Atom clamps? Who needs atom clamps? I love a funny
robot. <br>
(The Doctor opens a unit to reveal -) <br>

DOCTOR: Off we go then. <br>

up with Warning.) <br>

MIA: Oh, my God. Action Five. <br>

their voice to the sonics that are making the crack bigger. Gadget
reaches the Tardis.) <br>

DOCTOR: He's lost his signal. Doesn't know where he is. <br>
ADELAIDE: That's my house. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you get it? This is the twenty first of November 2059.
It's the same day on Earth. And it's snowing. I love snow. <br>
MIA: What is that thing? It's bigger. I mean, it's bigger on the
inside. Who the hell are you? <br>
(Mia runs away.) <br>
ADELAIDE: Look after her. <br>
YURI: Yes, ma'am. <br>
(Yuri runs after Mia.) <br>
ADELAIDE: You saved us. <br>
DOCTOR: Just think though. Your daughter, and your daughter's daughter,
you can see them again. Family reunion. <br>
ADELAIDE: But I'm supposed to be dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Not any more. <br>
ADELAIDE: But Susie, my granddaughter. The person she's supposed to
become might never exist now. <br>
DOCTOR: Nah! Captain Adelaide can inspire her face to face. Different
details, but the story's the same. <br>
ADELAIDE: You can't know that. And if my family changes, the whole of
history could change. The future of the human race. No-one should have
that much power. <br>
DOCTOR: Tough. <br>
ADELAIDE: You should have left us there. <br>
DOCTOR: Adelaide, I've done this sort of thing before. In small ways,
saved some little people, but never someone as important as you. Oh,
I'm good. <br>
ADELAIDE: Little people? What, like Mia and Yuri? Who decides they're
so unimportant? You? <br>
DOCTOR: For a long time now, I thought I was just a survivor, but I'm
not. I'm the winner. That's who I am. The Time Lord Victorious. <br>
ADELAIDE: And there's no one to stop you. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
ADELAIDE: This is wrong, Doctor. I don't care who you are. The Time
Lord Victorious is wrong. <br>
DOCTOR: That's for me to decide. Now, you'd better get home. Oh, it's
all locked up. You've been away. Still, that's easy. <br>
(He points his sonic screwdriver at the front door, and it opens.) <br>
DOCTOR: All yours. <br>
ADELAIDE: Is there nothing you can't do? <br>
DOCTOR: Not any more. <br>
(Adelaide goes inside, drawing her gun and closing the door. Then we
hear the shot and see the energy blast light up the window. The Doctor
turns around and in his head, he watches the history record change her
place of death from Mars to Earth. Susie Fontana Brooke still goes into
space, though.) <br>
ADELAIDE [OC]: I don't care who you are. The Time Lord Victorious is
wrong. <br>
(The Doctor turns to see an Ood looking at him.) <br>
DOCTOR: I've gone too far. Is this it? My death? Is it time? <br>
(The Doctor falls to his knees. The Ood vanishes. He gets up again and
goes inside the Tardis.)
