<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (It is nighttime in the jungle. A group carrying
torches gather around a square hole that has been dug in the ground and
lined with planks, like a well. On one side is a rope winch. Two of the
group hold a man by his arms, and two women look down into the pit then
raise their arms. A man produces an enormous horn, almost as big as
himself, and blows, while the prisoner falls to his knees and clasps
his hands, whimpering. Below ground, something growls. The younger
woman nods, and the prisoner is pushed into the pit.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (K9 is reading from Peter Rabbit by Beatrix
Potter, held up for him by the Doctor, while Romana drags in a large
box of spare parts. K9 has a new voice, courtesy of David Brierley.) <br>
K9: Peter gave himself for lost and shed big tears, but his sobs were
overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew to him in great excitement
and implored him to exert himself. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, I've been cleaning out number four hold. You've got the
most awful lot of junk in there. <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Something terribly exciting's about to happen. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, really? What? <br>
DOCTOR: Mister McGregor. <br>
ROMANA: Who? <br>
DOCTOR: Mister McGregor. He's chasing Peter Rabbit. He's got a sieve.
He's going to pop it on top of Peter! <br>
ROMANA: Don't worry. He'll wriggle out, lose his jacket and hop into a
watering can. <br>
DOCTOR: Atchoo. <br>
K9: Bless you. <br>
DOCTOR: Junk? Did you say junk? I don't carry junk. <br>
ROMANA: What do you call this lot, then? <br>
DOCTOR: That's extremely valuable equipment. <br>
ROMANA: An old ball of string? <br>
DOCTOR: Give that to me. Come on, give it to me. <br>
ROMANA: (reads label on bottom) To the Doctor. A souvenir with love and
thanks for all his help with the Minotaur. Theseus and Ariadne. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. If I hadn't produced that ball of string to find a way out
of the labyrinth, they were going to unravel my scarf, the wretches. <br>
ROMANA: All right, but what can you possibly do with the old jawbone of
an ass? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't be a philistine. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: That jawbone's been about a bit, you know. <br>
(He puts in into his coat inside pocket.) <br>
ROMANA: All right, so what's this then? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's just a bit of old junk. <br>
K9: A mark three emergency transceiver, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: You mean it's part of the Tardis? <br>
K9: Correct, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: Then why isn't it plugged in, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Because is doesn't work. <br>
K9: Incorrect, master. The transceiver is fully operative. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but it's an awful nuisance. <br>
ROMANA: You mean you kept getting calls from Gallifrey all the time.
Would you do this, would you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Such a bore. <br>
ROMANA: That's what it's for. <br>
DOCTOR: What, to bore? <br>
ROMANA: No, to receive and send distress signals. <br>
DOCTOR: I was never in distress. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, not often. I mean, not what you'd call often. Go on, plug
it in. <br>
(Romana places the hemisphere where it belong. It lights up, makes a
metallic tinkling sound, and the Tardis promptly goes sideways,
knocking them off their feet and the coat stand falls onto the Doctor.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Switch it off! Switch it off! <br>
(Romana pulls it off the console and the Tardis stabilises.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's better. I told you that thing never worked properly. <br>
K9: Inaccurate, master. The transceiver has never been used properly
before. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's a fault in it then, isn't there. That was no
distress call. Was it? Was it? <br>
K9: Insufficient data, master, but there is no fault in the equipment. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I'm delighted to hear it. <br>
K9: But your last statement <br>
DOCTOR: But shush. We've landed. I wonder where we are? Anyone know? <br>
(The scanner shows lush vegetation and a geodesic structure close up.) <br>
ROMANA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: No idea. Let's find out, shall we? Not you, K9. You stay here.
By the way, how did you know about Peter Rabbit? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, Peter Rabbit, Squirrel Nutkin, Mrs Tiggywinkle, Jemima
Puddleduck </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: That's odd. <br>
ROMANA: It's so green. <br>
DOCTOR: It's very odd. <br>
ROMANA: What's odd? <br>
DOCTOR: This is. <br>
ROMANA: What is that thing? <br>
(The Doctor taps it with a spoon.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's an egg. <br>
ROMANA: An egg? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, part of a shell, anyway. Can't see the rest of it. <br>
ROMANA: It's huge. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
ROMANA: What kind of bird laid that? <br>
DOCTOR: If it was a bird. <br>
ROMANA: What do you think it was, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Semi-metallic. <br>
ROMANA: Metallic? You mean metal birds laying metal eggs? <br>
(The Doctor touches it and pulls his hand back quickly.) <br>
ROMANA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's alive. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: The shell. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, don't be ridiculous. <br>
DOCTOR: Listen. Can't you hear? <br>
ROMANA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's the same noise we heard in the Tardis. There must be a
transmitter here. <br>
ROMANA: In an eggshell? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, somewhere, somewhere. It stands to reason. <br>
ROMANA: Stands to reason. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Stands to reason. Stupid expression, stands to reason. <br>
(Romana walks round the back of the section, which has ivy growing up
it, while the Doctor gets out his stethoscope and listens to the
shell.) <br>
DOCTOR: Why doesn't it lie down to reason? Much easier to reason lying
down. Relaxes the cerebellum.) <br>
(He notices a large barrel cactus that might not have been behind them
before, then sits on the ground to continue his examination. The cactus
rolls forward.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! It's definitely the shell that's the transmitter. I wonder
what it's transmitting, and to whom? Well, I suppose to whatever laid
it. Hmm, that's not a very pleasant thought, is it, Doctor. <br>
(Now two barrel cacti move forward.) <br>
DOCTOR: Curious material. Almost looks as if it. Almost looks as if it
were woven. <br>
(Now there are four cacti inching forward. The Doctor looks away again
and they rush on top of him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! That's sharp. Romana. Romana! Romana, would you come here a
moment, please? Oh, hello. <br>
(A figure is silhouetted against the light. He is holding a large
sword-like thing.) <br>
DOCTOR: Have you seen my assistant? Romana! Romana! Obviously not. All
right, I won't bother you then. <br>
(A second figure arrives.) <br>
DOCTOR: Can you get these things off me? <br>
(A third figure cracks a whip and the cacti roll away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Did you get those things off me? <br>
HUNTSMAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. <br>
HUNTSMAN: Kill him. <br>
DOCTOR: What? And just as we're all getting on so well? <br>
HUNTSMAN: Kill him. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, I don't want to stand on protocol or anything like that,
but couldn't you at least do the done thing and take me to your leader?
<br>
(The first swordsman is ready to swing when the older woman from the
pit speaks.) <br>
KARELA: Wait. <br>
(The swordsman manages to miss.) <br>
DOCTOR: Wait! Are you in charge here? <br>
KARELA: I am. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. You saved my life and I am a doctor. What
are those things? <br>
KARELA: Wolfweeds. <br>
DOCTOR: Weeds? What, plant weeds? <br>
KARELA: Of course. Specially grown in the Lady Adrasta's nurseries. <br>
DOCTOR: Good lord. If I were you, I'd introduce her to geraniums before
it's too late. <br>
KARELA: What are you doing in the Place of Death? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just pottering around. I have this insatiable curiosity,
you see. Why do you call it the Place of Death? <br>
KARELA: Because anyone found here is automatically condemned to death. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Is that so? You know, I've always been fascinated by place
names and I trust you'll make an exception in my case. <br>
KARELA: Your commander says this is yours. <br>
(She nods towards the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: My commander? <br>
(Karela points to Romana, who shrugs.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that commander. Hello, commander. <br>
KARELA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's tricky to explain. <br>
KARELA: What does it do? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it travels. We travel in it. Look, I'll show you. You'll
like it. Come along, Romana. <br>
KARELA: Secure him. Travels? How? It has no wheels. <br>
(The Doctor's head and wrists are put into a portable stock.) <br>
KARELA: I hope you're not lying, Doctor. The Lady Adrasta will want to
question you. <br>
DOCTOR: There was no need to go to all this trouble. All she had to do
was make an appointment. <br>
HUNTSMAN: Madam, the wolfweeds sense danger. <br>
KARELA: We move out. Bring the woman. <br>
(Karela steps onto her litter and is carried along, while Romana and
the Doctor follow and the Huntsman brings up the rear. Someone is
watching.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Jungle]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: What do you think is going on? <br>
ROMANA: I don't know. At least we're still alive. <br>
DOCTOR: You realise, of course, we're being followed. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
HUNTSMAN: No talking! <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm? Nice place you've got here, old chap. Very green. <br>
HUNTSMAN: Silence! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Sorry. <br>
(Shaggy, dirty, bearded faces watch from the foliage, then with a yell
they leap out on the procession with large cudgels. The Doctor knocks a
couple of them over with his stock, but Romana is captured. The
primitives run off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Romana? Romana? Where's Romana? <br>
HUNTSMAN: Captured. Shall we go after the girl, madam? The wolfweeds
can follow the tracks. <br>
KARELA: And lead us into another ambush? No, Huntsman. <br>
DOCTOR: Who were they? <br>
KARELA: Bandits. These hills are full of them. No traveller's safe.
Unless you want to get your throat cut, you'd better keep up with us. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what about Romana? <br>
KARELA: Oh, pray that they kill her quickly. Come on. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Bandit camp]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (We are in a large wooden framed building with
lots of furs for a roof and walls. The table is littered with metal
objects - rusty chain, pewter goblets and more. A grey-haired man picks
up a small piece and acts like Fagin from Oliver Twist.) <br>
TORVIN: Oh, look at that. Pure bronze. Beautiful, beautiful. <br>
(He picks up a vase.) <br>
TORVIN: Oh, lovely. Exquisite. Such shape, such form, such delightfully
iron metal content. <br>
(Romana is hustled in.) <br>
TORVIN: Got anything, my lovely boys? What have you brought old
Torvin? <br>
EDU: Her. <br>
TORVIN: Her? What use is she? I mean, she's not metal, is she? <br>
EDU: She's one of Lady Adrasta's ladies in waiting. She has to be. Look
at her clothes. <br>
(Torvin takes a looted hunter's sword.) <br>
TORVIN: What do her clothes matter to me? Cloth is easy enough to come
by. Any metal on her? <br>
EDU: No. <br>
TORVIN: Oh, kill her, then. We've got enough mouths to feed. <br>
EDU: Maybe we could ransom her? <br>
TORVIN: Ransom? Use your brains. If she's one of Adrasta's ladies in
waiting, Adrasta will hunt us down. Kill her. <br>
EDU: She could be valuable. <br>
TORVIN: Valuable? Oh no, she's not valuable. Yeah, unless she's got a
metal leg or something. Kill her. <br>
AINU: I say we don't kill her unless we vote on it. <br>
EDU: He's right. You're not leader. <br>
TORVIN: No, no, dear boy. Well, of course you must vote. So, vote.
Yeah, well, I'm all for democracy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Entrance hall]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Karela leads the Doctor into an altogether more
solid building, with arched windows, tiled floor and woven rugs.) <br>
KARELA: Wait there. <br>
(The Doctor tries to follow her into the next room, but is barred by
guards. He returns to his escort.) <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mind? I've got a terrible itch. Itchy nose. No, no, no,
no, no. My nose, not your nose. Come on, come over here. Come on. Put
your finger up like that. Now, you scratch my nose. Ooo, other side.
That is so good. Atchoo! <br>
(He lunges forwards and knocks both men out with the wooden stock.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry about that, fellows. <br>
(The Doctor unbars the main door and is about to turn the handle when
-) <br>
ADRASTA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
(The younger woman comes out of the room, followed by Karela.) <br>
DOCTOR: You know how it is when you get an itch. <br>
ADRASTA: Perhaps I can be of help. <br>
(She reaches for his nose with her long, sharp fingernails.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, thank you. There's no itch any more. <br>
ADRASTA: Do let me take that thing off. <br>
(She removes the locking pin from the stock.) <br>
ADRASTA: I so like my guests to feel comfortable. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it was a bit incommodious. <br>
ADRASTA: It doesn't seem to have incommoded you too much, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose you could say the yoke's on him, if you were the sort
of person who said that sort of thing, which fortunately I'm not. You
must be the Lady Adrasta. <br>
ADRASTA: And you're the fellow who was found in the Place of Death. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes! Do you know, I'll tell you something fascinating about
that. <br>
ADRASTA: Anyone found there is put to death. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you knew. Well, don't you think you could at least put up a
notice? <br>
ADRASTA: Tell me, what did you make of the object? Some of the finest
brains on Chloris have devoted years to trying to unravel the problem. <br>
DOCTOR: Do you mean the egg? <br>
ADRASTA: Egg? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ADRASTA: Are you sure? <br>
DOCTOR: Well <br>
ADRASTA: Have you seen anything like it before? <br>
DOCTOR: No, but I'm full of theories about it. <br>
(Adrasta leads him into the room she came out of.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Throne room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Which contains a large gold throne on a dais.) <br>
ADRASTA: What kind of creature laid it? <br>
DOCTOR: Lady Adrasta, I'd like to talk to you about these things, but
at the moment I'm much more concerned about Romana. <br>
ADRASTA: Ah yes, Madam Karela told me. Your commander. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, she's not my commander. She's my companion. <br>
ADRASTA: Of course. I couldn't see a man of your obvious talents in a
subordinate position. <br>
DOCTOR: You couldn't see a man of my obvious talents in a sub. Oh, no,
of course. You're very kind. <br>
ADRASTA: Yes, aren't I. And I'll send a troop of guards to find her.
See to it. <br>
KARELA: Immediately, my lady. <br>
(Karela leaves.) <br>
ADRASTA: Don't worry, Doctor. My wolfweeds will hunt down those animals
that took Romana. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm, I wonder what they'll do to her? <br>
ADRASTA: The wolfweeds? <br>
DOCTOR: No, the bandits. <br>
ADRASTA: Kill her quickly, if she's lucky. <br>
DOCTOR: And if she's not? <br>
ADRASTA: Slowly. </font></p>

behind her back.) <br>
TORVIN: Ready, boys? <br>
(The bandits gather at the table and hold their hands over two bowls.) <br>
TORVIN: One, two. <br>
(They all drop brass strips into one of the two bowls. One bowl only
has one strip in it.) <br>
TORVIN: Everybody voted? We're all agreed, then. Good, my lovely boys,
good. Kill her. <br>
EDU: Now what will killing her achieve? <br>
ROMANA: Go ahead. <br>
TORVIN: What did you say? <br>
ROMANA: I said, go ahead and kill me. Commit suicide. Listen to that
hirsute moron. <br>
TORVIN: Here, who are you calling hair suit? <br>
ROMANA: You. Do you want to make something of it? <br>
TORVIN: No, I just want to know what it means. <br>
ROMANA: It means hairy. <br>
EDU: What do you mean, my lady? <br>
ROMANA: I should have thought that was obvious. Hairy, covered with
hair. <br>
EDU: No. What do you mean when you said we were committing suicide. <br>
ROMANA: Well, if this Lady Adrasta, whoever she might be, is going to
hunt you down for kidnapping me, what do you think she'll do if she
finds out you've killed me? <br>
EDU: She's right. <br>
AINU: What do you mean, whoever Lady Adrasta might be? You're her lady
in waiting, aren't you? <br>
ROMANA: No. <br>
AINU: Then who are you, milady? <br>
ROMANA: That's the first intelligent question you've asked. I'm a
traveller. I'm a Time Lord. And I am not used to being assaulted by a
collection of hairy, grubby little men. <br>
TORVIN: Well, she's no call to get personal. <br>
ROMANA: I don't intend to get used to it, either. Sit down. <br>
TORVIN: Kill her! <br>
ROMANA: Untie me. <br>
(Torvin fetches a large stone axe.) <br>
TORVIN: Here, don't listen to her. She's only trying to trick you. <br>
(Ainu unties Romana.) <br>
ROMANA: Sit. Sit. <br>
(All the bandits sit on the floor except Torvin, who finally wilts
under Romana's imperious glare.) <br>
ROMANA: That's better. Now, let's talk this over sensibly. <br>
(Romana takes K9's dog whistle from her cleavage.) <br>
TORVIN: Here, what's this? <br>
ROMANA: See for yourself. <br>
TORVIN: Here, do you know what this is? <br>
AINU: Yeah, it's a piece of metal. <br>
TORVIN: Yeah, I know what it is, but what is it? <br>
ROMANA: You blow through it. <br>
(Torvin hands it to Ainu, who blows through the ring on the end. Then
Edu blows across the top of it. Finally Torvin puts it in his mouth and
blows it properly.) <br>
TORVIN: What is it? <br>
ROMANA: It's a whistle. <br>
TORVIN: A whistle? <br>
ROMANA: Go on. Try blowing harder. <br>

on the wall behind the throne dais.) <br>
ADRASTA: Doctor, you said you had some theories about this eggshell? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. What is this thing? <br>
ADRASTA: Later, Doctor. About the eggshell. <br>
DOCTOR: Extraordinary texture. How long has it been there? <br>
ADRASTA: We discovered it about fifteen years ago. The shell, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: The shell? <br>
ADRASTA: Yes. My huntsman heard you say that the shell was alive. <br>
DOCTOR: Alive and screaming in pain. <br>
ADRASTA: The shell? Then why can no one hear it? <br>
DOCTOR: Because it can only be detected on very low frequency
wavelengths. <br>
ADRASTA: What's the shell screaming about? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. More to the point, for whom is it screaming? Its mummy? By
the pyramids, imagine the size of its mummy. <br>
(Adrasta snaps her fingers and two men step out from behind a curtain.)
<br>
ADRASTA: You heard? <br>
TOLLUND: Yes, my lady. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are these, the undertakers? <br>
ADRASTA: Engineers. Doran and Tollund. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, how do you do? <br>
TOLLUND: Our task is to discover the function of the object that you
mistakenly called an eggshell. <br>
DOCTOR: Why, what would you call it? <br>
TOLLUND: Well, Engineer Doran, in his latest paper on the subject, has
proved conclusively that it is part of an ancient building. Perhaps a
temple. <br>
DOCTOR: A temple. Ha! <br>
ADRASTA: You're not convinced, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Convinced? Pooh. <br>
ADRASTA: You still think it's a shell. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course it is, of a sort. <br>
TOLLUND: Well, I myself have calculated that a bird large enough to lay
that egg would have to have a wingspan of at least a mile. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
TOLLUND: Well, do you know many birds that large? <br>
DOCTOR: No, but it isn't only birds that lay eggs, is it? Fishes do. <br>
TOLLUND: Big fish. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, very big ones. Or a big reptile. <br>
TOLLUND: Mmm, yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps a gigantic frog. <br>
DORAN: Really, Doctor. How do you account for the marks of intense heat
on the exterior of the shell? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, someone tried to fry the egg? <br>
DORAN: My lady, this man is being facetious. <br>
DOCTOR: He's quite right. <br>
ADRASTA: Doran, I saw no mention in your paper that the shell was
alive. <br>
DORAN: It can't be, my lady. It's impossible. We detected nothing. <br>
ADRASTA: But this man did. <br>
DORAN: He's mistaken. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, to be fair, I did have a couple of gadgets which he
probably didn't, like a teaspoon and an open mind. <br>
ADRASTA: You have failed me, Engineer Doran. <br>
(A lady in waiting rings a bell. Doran sinks to his knees.) <br>
ADRASTA: Take him. <br>
(Two guards come to take him away.) <br>
DORAN: My lady, I beg you. No, please, no! <br>
DOCTOR: Where are they taking him? <br>
(Tollund hides his head in his cowl.) <br>
ADRASTA: Come and see. <br>
(Tollund dashes behind the curtain.) <br>
ADRASTA: Perhaps you will find it instructive. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps I will, and interesting too, I hope. <br>
ADRASTA: Doctor, you know more about the shell than you're prepared to
say. Perhaps a little demonstration will make you more cooperative.
Bring him. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, how nice to meet a well-mannered guard. </font></p>

ROMANA: Why is that? <br>
ADRASTA: Our researchers divide into two categories. The ones who have

ROMANA: But you must know something about it. <br>
ADRASTA: It kills people. What more is there to know? <br>

ROMANA: Why are you so interested in that shell? <br>
ADRASTA: There are some questions, my dear, it is better not to ask.
You do know about the shell? <br>

ADRASTA: Yes, Madam Karela told me, but you still haven't answered my

ADRASTA: Ah, your curious tin animal. <br>
ROMANA: What are you going to do with him? <br>
ADRASTA: On our planet, my dear, metal of whatever sort is valuable.
Far too valuable for mere toys. Guards, break up the tin dog. Smash it

anybody, like preventing them from being eaten by a monster, then do
so. They might be grateful. So I did. <br>

ADRASTA: How? My men can't break through the shell the creature has
woven. <br>
ROMANA: A shell? <br>
ADRASTA: If we are to rescue the Doctor, we have to break through the

evaluated. <br>

strong enough to kill the Creature, too. Come on. <br>

K9: Incorrect. I weaken the shell, but the material is self-renewing. <br>

ERATO: Please allow me to explain. This is not the Doctor speaking. I

ERATO: My name is Erato. <br>

ERATO: I am from the planet Tythonus. <br>
ROMANA: Then what are you doing here skulking about in a pit eating
people? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, please! You put that very crudely. <br>
ERATO: To skulk about in pits, as you so crudely put it, is not my
normal habit. I most emphatically do not eat people. I live by
ingesting chlorophyll and mineral salts. I would have you know that I
am the Tythonian High Ambassador. <br>
ORGANON: Really? <br>
ERATO: I am. I was on a trading mission to this planet when I <br>

DOCTOR: Of course! I should have guessed instantly. It's all the fault
of that woman Adrasta. <br>
ADRASTA: Yes, Doctor? <br>
(Karela and the Huntsman have arrived with the wolfweeds, who have
smothered K9 again.) <br>
ADRASTA: You were just saying? <br>
DOCTOR: I was just saying, lady Adrasta, that. K9, I thought you were
meant to be guarding her. <br>
K9: Apologies, master. I am immobile. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
K9: I was overpowered by the wolfweeds. <br>
ADRASTA: Doctor, order your dog to kill the Tythonian. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
ADRASTA: If you do not, your friend Organon dies. <br>
DOCTOR: Organon? Goodbye, old man. So sorry about this. Thanks for all
the help. <br>
ORGANON: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: If my deductions are correct, the well-being of two planets is
at stake. Erato must not die. <br>
ADRASTA: Huntsman, set the wolfweeds on the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, wait. That's all you've got on this planet, isn't it?
Weeds, weeds, forest and weeds. You scratch about for food wherever you
can, but you can't plough the land, can you? You can't do anything
until you've mastered the forests and the weeds. And you can't do that
without metal. <br>
ADRASTA: Don't listen to him. It's just the ravings of a demented space
tramp. Set the wolfweeds on him! <br>
DOCTOR: Do that, and you will hurl this planet back into the dark ages.
And for what? To satisfy the petty power cravings of that pathetic
woman. <br>
ADRASTA: Have a care, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Have a care yourself. Care for your people for a change. <br>
ADRASTA: Kill him! <br>
(The Huntsman moves towards the Doctor, then stops.) <br>
HUNTSMAN: Let him speak. <br>
ADRASTA: Huntsman, I order you. <br>
HUNTSMAN: Let him speak. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, if my deductions are correct. <br>
ADRASTA: They're not. <br>
DOCTOR: Erato came here fifteen years ago to propose a trading
agreement. Tythonus is a planet rich in metallic ores and minerals. Am
I not right, K9? <br>
K9: Checking data banks. Affirmative, master. <br>
DOCTOR: That was a good guess. <br>
ADRASTA: Fools! You listen to the opinions of an electric dog? <br>
DOCTOR: The Tythonions exist on ingesting chlorophyll. Large quantities
of it, judging by their size. Now, there's a superabundance of planet
life on Chloris, so <br>
ROMANA: So Erato came here to offer you metal in return for
chlorophyll. Of course! <br>
DOCTOR: Right. But who was the first person he met? <br>
ORGANON: The person who held the monopoly of metal here. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. And did she put the welfare of her struggling people
above her own petty power? No. She's tipped the ambassador into a pit
and threw astrologers at him. <br>
HUNTSMAN: Is this true, my lady? <br>
ADRASTA: Not a word of it. It's a pack of lies. <br>
DOCTOR: Let's see if Erato agrees with me, shall we? <br>
ADRASTA: That won't prove anything! You just take hold of that thing
and say exactly what you like. You expect intelligent people to fall
for your childish tricks? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's very simple. Why don't you come over here, take hold
of the communicator and we'll hear the truth from your larynx. <br>
ADRASTA: What? No. Don't talk such rubbish. Huntsman, I order you to
kill the Doctor! <br>
HUNTSMAN: My lady, I think we want to hear the truth of this. Go and
speak with the Creature. <br>
ADRASTA: No. I refuse. I utterly refuse. <br>
(The Huntsman cracks his whip.) <br>
HUNTSMAN: I think not, my lady. <br>
(The wolfweeds roll towards her, and she backs away towards Erato.) <br>
ADRASTA: No! Back! Back! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, just take hold of the communicator. <br>
(The Doctor puts her hand on the boss. Erato uses her larynx.) <br>
ERATO: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
(Adrasta pulls away, but the Doctor firmly puts her hand back.) <br>
ERATO: Your deductions are, of course, correct. We are running
dangerously short of chlorophyll on Tythonus, and have more metal than
we need. Reports reached us of this planet Chloris which had precisely
the opposite problem, and we thought that a trading agreement would be
mutually beneficial. <br>
ADRASTA: It's lies, lies! It's all lies! <br>
(The wolfweeds drive her back to Erato.) <br>
ERATO: No, it is you who are lying. Unfortunately, I ran foul of this
evil woman who tricked me into the Pit. If you will forgive me, I have
a score to settle. <br>
HUNTSMAN: Yes. So, I think, have we. <br>
(One firm crack of the whip, and the wolfweeds engulf Adrasta. She goes
down screaming. Erato surges forward and also rolls on top of the
squirming pile. Karela and the guards leave. When it is done, only
Adrasta is left with web over her.) <br>
DOCTOR: She's dead. <br>
HUNTSMAN: Yes. And with her die the dark ages for this planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Erato. <br>
ERATO: I'm sorry for all the unpleasantness, but thank you for the
weeds. <br>
DOCTOR: My pleasure. <br>
ERATO: They are the first solid meal I've had in fifteen years. I
wonder if you could arrange to have me hoisted out of the Pit? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. Huntsman? See to it. It is a bit
claustrophobic down here. <br>
HUNTSMAN: Thank you, Doctor. <br>

just trying any way he could to make contact. <br>
ROMANA: But we don't know anything about him. We don't even know how he
got here. <br>

DOCTOR: In an egg. When the shell's complete it's a blindingly simple
space vehicle complete with photon drive. <br>
ROMANA: Well, I didn't see a photon drive. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, of course he's not going to leave it lying round where
just anyone could take it. He protected it very carefully. <br>
ROMANA: How? <br>
(Organon puts a large astrological chart on the table.) <br>
DOCTOR: It was concealed in the pieces he kept hidden in the Pit. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
ROMANA: That shell. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
ROMANA: When we first landed, it was making a noise. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: Could it have been a distress signal? Perhaps it was calling
for help. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: But after fifteen years? <br>
K9: Tythonions live for up to forty thousand years, mistress. <br>
ROMANA: So fifteen years in the Pit for one of them would be no more
than the wink of an eye. <br>

craft before something dreadful happens. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>

go. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, Erato? <br>
ERATO: You must hold the star. I'm being dragged towards it. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold tight, everybody. <br>
(He switches the tractor beam on again.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's got it. Erato, get weaving! We're winning, Romana, we're
winning.<br>
ROMANA: We're placing a terrible strain on the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: How much longer, Erato? <br>
ERATO: You can turn off your gravity beam in five of your seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. <br>
ERATO: Four, three, two, one. <br>
(Bang! goes the console.) <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, what happened? <br>
DOCTOR: The control circuit. I can't turn off the beam! <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: We're pulling the star towards us. <br>
(Another bang, and they get thrown sideways.) <br>
ROMANA: We've got to dematerialise! <br>
(The Doctor gropes for the control, and the Tardis dematerialises just
as the neutron star reaches that point in space.) <br>
DOCTOR: Erato, we did it! <br>
ERATO: I still it was impossible. <br>
ROMANA: So do I, though I did calculate our changes of success at
seventy four million three hundred and eighty four thousand three
hundred and thirty eight to one against. <br>
DOCTOR: What? Seventy four million three hundred and eighty four
thousand three hundred and thirty eight? Well, that's extraordinary. <br>
ROMANA: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, that's my lucky number. </font></p>

into a crystal ball.) <br>
ORGANON: I see something tall, something dark. <br>
(The Tardis materialises by the door. The Huntsman walks in.) <br>
HUNTSMAN: How in Chloris did that get here? <br>
ORGANON: I don't know, but it's tall and dark and <br>
DOCTOR: Handsome! Yes, yes, I know, Organon. <br>
ORGANON: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Are you in charge here now? <br>
HUNTSMAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, good. Well, we've just dropped in to say goodbye and to
give you this. It's from Erato. <br>
(The Doctor hands over a large scroll. The Huntsman unrolls it, and
Organon sneaks a look over his shoulder.) <br>
HUNTSMAN: It's a draft contract for a trading agreement. <br>
(The Doctor and Romana sneak back into the Tardis.) <br>
HUNTSMAN: Do you know what this is? <br>
ORGANON: Yes. <br>
HUNTSMAN: What? <br>
ORGANON: It's a draft contract for a trading agreement. <br>
HUNTSMAN: How on Chloris did you know that? <br>
ORGANON: It was written in the stars. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) </font> </p>
