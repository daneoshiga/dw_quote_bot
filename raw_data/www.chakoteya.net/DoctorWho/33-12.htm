corridor]</b> </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Yorkshire 1893. In a small town perched on the
side of a hill, with factories belching smoke down by the river.) <br>
EDMUND: If I have not returned in an hour, you must fetch the police. <br>
EFFIE: Edmund! <br>
(She kisses her husband.) <br>
EDMUND: Don't fret, Effie, my dear. All will be well, but we must get
to the bottom of this dark and queer business no matter what the cost. <br>
(Edmund walks to the end of the corridor, where there is a room with a
red glow coming through the round window in the door. He goes inside. A
door opens behind Effie and a group of ladies in black gowns and
bonnets step through.) <br>
EFFIE: Mrs Gillyflower! <br>
(An elderly lady.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: We have come about your husband, my dear. A tragedy. <br>
EFFIE: My husband? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Your late husband. <br>
EFFIE: There must be some mistake. My husband is quite well. <br>
(A scream from behind the door.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: We're so very sorry for your loss. <br>
(Effie screams.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Morgue]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The attendant uncovers the corpse of Edmund. He
is frozen mid-scream and staring, and his skin is bright red.) <br>
AMOS: Hell fire. That's put me right off me mash. Another one. <br>
THURSDAY: Another? <br>
(The speaker is the spitting image of the late Edmund, but with a
moustache.) <br>
AMOS: He's not the first one I've had in here looking like that. The
Crimson Horror, that's what they're calling it. <br>
THURSDAY: I have no interest in the deplorable excesses of the Penny
Dreadfuls. <br>
AMOS: Hey, hey. Payment in advance, flower. Taking a big risk, you see,
I am. They'll have my vitals for fiddle-strings if they knew I'd let
you come to look at one of their precious stiffs. <br>
THURSDAY: This stiff is my brother. I've come up from London to bring
him home. <br>
AMOS: Oh aye? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Conservatory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (At the back of an elegant house - 13 Paternoster
Row, London.) <br>
THURSDAY: Thank you for agreeing to this meeting. I'm told you are the
investigator to see if there are strange goings-on. <br>
(The lady of the house is heavily veiled.) <br>
VASTRA: I read of your brother's death. Another victim of the Crimson
Horror, I believe. <br>
THURSDAY: So it is claimed. He was a newspaper man. He and a young
woman were working undercover. Tell me, madam, do you know what an
optogram is? <br>
VASTRA: It is a silly superstition, sir. The belief that the eye can
retain an image of the last thing it sees. <br>
(See the <a href="12-2.htm" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
Ark In Space</a>. Mister Thursday has taken photographs of his
dead brother Edmund's staring eyes. He passes one to Jenny the maid,
who hands it on to her mistress. Vastra throws back her veil.) <br>
VASTRA: Good grief. <br>
THURSDAY: Oh, god. <br>
(And faints.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Jenny and Vastra make enlargements of the
photographs.) <br>
JENNY: Well, I'll be blowed. I think, madam, that we'd better make
plans to head north. <br>
(The enlargement reveals an image of a red-faced, screaming Doctor.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Carriage]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VASTRA: According to my research, Sweetville's
proprietor holds recruitment drives for her little community. She is
only interested in the fittest and the most beautiful. <br>
STRAX: You may rely on me, ma'am. <br>
VASTRA: I was, in fact, speaking to Jenny. <br>
STRAX: Jenny. If this weak and fleshy boy is to represent us, I
strongly recommend the issuing of scissor grenades, limbo vapour and
triple blast brain splitters. <br>
VASTRA: What for? <br>
STRAX: Just generally. Remember, we are going to the north. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chapel]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The poster advertising the meeting proclaims Mrs
Winifred Gillyflower on the Present Moral Decay and the Coming
Apocalypse.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Bradford, that Babylon of the moderns with its crystal
light and its glitter, all aswarm with the wretched ruins of humanity.
Men and women crushed by the devil's juggernaut. <br>
(She has a good congregation, who agree with her. Jenny is listening
carefully.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: And moral turpitude can destroy the most delicate of
lives. Believe me, I know. I know. <br>
(A curtain is drawn back.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Me own daughter, blinded in a drunken rage by my late
husband. Her once beautiful eyes, pale and white as mistletoe berries. <br>
(The daughter gets up from a chair and taps her way to a covered
board.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: And what, my friends, is your story? Will you be found
wanting when the End of Days is come, when judgement rains down upon us
all? Or will you be preserved against the coming apocalypse? Do not
despair. I offer a way out. There is a different path. Sweetville! <br>
(The blind woman pulls the cover from an illustration of an ideal
community. Factory with two rows of terraced homes, its own chapel and
bandstand and gardens. Think along the lines of the original model
village of Bourneville.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Join us. Join us in this shining city on the hill. (sings)
Bring me my bow of burning gold. Bring me my arrows of desire. <br>
(Later, the congregation are queuing up in front of the pulpit.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: You wish to join us, my dear? <br>
JENNY: If it's all the same with you, ma'am. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Oh yes, dear. You'll do very nicely. <br>
(Jenny signs the big book.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Carriage]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VASTRA: If our stratagem succeeds, Jenny will
infiltrate deep into the black heart of this curious place. <br>
STRAX: And how will she locate the Doctor? <br>
VASTRA: To find him, she needs only ignore all keep-out signs, go
through every locked door, and run towards any form of danger that
presents itself. <br>
STRAX:: Business as usual, then. <br>
VASTRA: Business as usual. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the secret room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The blind girl makes her way upstairs with a
plate of food and goes to a locked room. She lifts a hatch at the base
of the door and slides the plate through.) <br>
ADA: Did you think I'd forgotten you, dear monster, hmm? <br>
(There is a crash and bang inside the room, and she leaves.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside a house]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mister Thursday knocks on the door. It is
opened.) <br>
THURSDAY: I have travelled from London expressly to see Madame Vastra.
If you'd be so kind as to announce me, my good man. <br>
(He hands over his card.) <br>
STRAX: Whom shall I say is calling? <br>
(Mister Thursday sees who he is talking to, and faints.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Drawing room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mister Thursday is lying on a couch, being fanned
by Strax.) <br>
STRAX: It asked for permission to enter and then it fell over. What are
we to make of it? <br>
VASTRA: I imagine Mister Thursday wants to know what progress we are
making. The question is, how did the Doctor's image come to be
preserved on a dead man's eye? It's a scientific impossibility. I
wonder how Jenny is getting on. <br>
STRAX: If she hasn't make contact by nightfall, I suggest a massive
frontal assault on the factory, madam. Casualties can be kept to
perhaps as little as eighty percent. <br>
VASTRA: I think there may be subtler ways of proceeding, Strax. <br>
STRAX: Suit yourself. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Factory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Prospective employees both male and female are
queuing up. A red-headed woman is talking to Jenny.) <br>
ABIGAIL: I'm dead nervous, aren't you? They have to be sure, you see.
Only the best for Sweetville. I hope me teeth don't let me down. I'm
Abigail. <br>
JENNY: Pleased to meet you. <br>
ABIGAIL: You're not local, are you. <br>
JENNY: Nah. Up from London. <br>
ABIGAIL: Different here, I bet. <br>
JENNY: Yeah. Like a bleeding horse market. Do you know anyone who's
come to live here? In Sweetville, I mean. <br>
ABIGAIL: I had a pal who come here three month back. She wrote to tell
me how perfect it all were. Funny, though. I've not heard a peep from
her since. <br>
PILGRIM [OC]: Next, please! <br>
ABIGAIL: Hang on, we're moving. <br>
(Jenny steps aside to a door and gets her roll of lockpicking tools
out.) <br>
ABIGAIL: What're you doing? <br>
JENNY: Do me a favour. Cause a distraction. <br>
ABIGAIL: What? <br>
JENNY: Swoon. Have a funny turn. Fit of the vapours. <br>
ABIGAIL: Are you crackers? <br>
JENNY: Go on. There's a guinea in it for you. <br>
ABIGAIL: Done. <br>
(Abigail gasps for breath loudly then faints. A crowd gathers around
her and Jenny gets through the locked door. It takes her to the factory
floor, where the deafening thumps of machinery are being broadcast
through three large gramophone horns. There is nothing else here. Jenny
sees two men carry a large bottle of red liquid through the room and
get into a lift.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Morgue]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> AMOS: Them new manufacturers can do horrible
things to a person. Horrible. I've pickled things in here that'd fair
turn your hair snowy as top of Buckden Pike. <br>
VASTRA: You know what I'm looking for. <br>
AMOS: Oh, aye. All them bits found in t'canal. The Crimson Horror. <br>
(He hands over a large bottle half full of red liquid. Vastra throws
back her veil with her back to him.) <br>
VASTRA: It hardly seems possible. <br>
AMOS: Eh? <br>
VASTRA: I think, I think I've seen these symptoms before. <br>
AMOS: Oh aye? <br>
VASTRA: A long time ago. <br>
AMOS: Oh aye? How long? <br>
(She turns around.) <br>
VASTRA: About sixty five million years. </font></p>

ADA: I trust you had a pleasant day, Mama? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Tolerable. <br>
ADA: Will Mister Sweet ever join us for dinner, Mama? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Mister Sweet is rather tired tonight, I fear. <br>
(His place at the head of the table is set, but vacant. Mrs Gillyflower
knocks over the salt dish.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Dear me. How clumsy I'm getting. <br>
(She throws a pinch of salt over her right shoulder.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: To keep the Devil at bay. <br>
(A manservant nods and leaves. Then Mrs Gillyflower sprinkles some salt
inside her clothes.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the secret room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Jenny has taken the lift up to the corridor with
the red lit door. There is a rhythmic thumping noise coming from above,
so she climbs a spiral staircase to another floor and finds another
locked door. The one with the hatch at the bottom. She raises the hatch
and a red hand grabs her. She struggles free and the hatch slides shut
again.) <br>
JENNY: All right, mate. You just stay calm now. (thump and rattle of
chains) I could open this door. Would you like that? (thump) Thought
you might. But you and me has got to come to an arrangement. Savvy?
(thump) Now, you stand well back, do you hear me? I don't mean no harm
to you, but you try anything funny and I'll leave you here to rot. Is
that understood? (thump, thump) Right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Secret room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JENNY: Doctor! <br>
(The Doctor has red skin, a gaping mouth, and is very stiff. He is in
chains and his clothes are lying nearby in the straw.) <br>
JENNY: What happened to you? Can't you speak? <br>
(His skin is tough as leather.) <br>
JENNY: Right. Right, we're getting out of here. </font></p>

the corridor.) <br>
JENNY: Come on. <br>

JENNY: Come on! <br>

Jenny guides the Doctor into the red glow room.) </font></p>

being manoeuvred over a large vat of bubbling red liquid, then lowered
in.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JENNY: What is it? You want to go in there? <br>
(He gets inside the small space. Jenny gives him his clothes, and with
groans of pain he powers up the sonic screwdriver. She shuts the door
and hides as two men walk past the entrance. A green glow comes from
the porthole in the metal door. Then it bursts open and a normal
looking and fully dressed Doctor bounces out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Missed me? <br>
JENNY: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Jenny. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny. Just when you think your
favourite lock-picking Victorian chambermaid will never turn up. Jenny.
<br>
(The Doctor takes her in his arms, bends her backwards and kisses her
long and hard on the lips. She slaps his face.) <br>
DOCTOR: You have no idea how good that feels. Right. Mrs Gillyflower.
We've got to stop her. And then there's Clara. Poor Clara. Where's
Clara? <br>
JENNY: Clara? Doctor, wait. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't. Clara. Got to find. <br>
JENNY: What happened to you? How long have you been like that? <br>
DOCTOR: Days, weeks, don't know. Long story. I'll keep it short. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Tardis materialises in a cobbled alley, in
sepia with tickly music in the background all the way through.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, so. Not London 1893. Yorkshire 1893. Near enough. <br>
CLARA: You're making a habit of this, getting us lost. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry. It's much better than it used to be. Ooo, I once spent a
hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow
Airport. <br>
(That would be Tegan Jovanka.) <br>
CLARA: What for? <br>
DOCTOR: Search me. Anyway <br>
(A woman screams.) <br>
DOCTOR: Brave heart, Clara. <br>
(By the canal.) <br>
EDMUND: It's another one. Don't you see? Another victim. Why won't any
one of you listen? <br>
DOCTOR: We'll listen. <br>
(They walk and talk on the way to the Sweetville main gates.) <br>
EDMUND: Mrs Winifred Gillyflower. An astonishing woman. Prize winning
chemist and mechanical engineer. So why <br>
DOCTOR: Why has she decided to open up a match factory in her old home
town. <br>
EDMUND: And no one who ever goes to live there ever seems to come out. <br>
(They go to the morgue.) <br>
EDMUND: Same as the rest. All dead from causes unknown and their flesh
glowing. <br>
AMOS: Like something manky in a coal cellar. They keep turning up in
t'canal. The Crimson Horror. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, good name. Hey, that's good, isn't it? The Crimson Horror.
I wonder what it is. Do you know the old Romany superstition, Clara?
That the eye of a dead person retains an image of the last thing it
sees. Nonsense, of course, unless the chemical composition of the body
has been massively corrupted. <br>
(Clara uses the Doctor's magnifying glass to look at the face of Mrs
Gillyflower in the dead woman's eye. The Doctor touches her skin and
the red comes off onto his white glove. He uses someone's chemistry
lab.) <br>
DOCTOR: Wow, this is nasty. An organic poison. A sort of venom. And you
think it's connected to Sweetville? <br>
EDMUND: I do. <br>
DOCTOR: Well then, we need a plan. <br>
(They visit Mrs Gillyflower at home.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Doctor and Mrs Smith. Oh yes, you'll do very nicely. <br>
(The Doctor does his best Michael Palin as a Yorkshireman accent.( <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, grand. Smashing. Eh, the missis and I couldn't be more
chuffed, could we, love? <br>
(Mrs Gillyflower leads them down the row of terraced homes.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Sweetville will provide you with everything you need. You
won't have to worry about a thing ever again. <br>
CLARA: The name, Sweetville. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Yes? <br>
CLARA: Why not name it after yourself. After al, it's your creation. <br>
DOCTOR: Gillyflowertown. Gillyflowerland. You could have roller
coasters. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: It is named in tribute to my partner. <br>
DOCTOR: Your late partner? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: No, my silent partner. Mister Sweet likes to keep himself
to himself. Shall we move on? <br>
DOCTOR: Who lives here? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Oh, names don't matter here. All you need to know is we
only recruit the brightest and the best. <br>
(She opens a front door to reveal a single living room. The man and
woman are seated at a tea table, under a giant bell jar. A pump is
providing air into in. Then her army of men and women come for the
Doctor and Clara. They get knocked out and dunked in the red liquid,
except the Doctor wakes up just as he is going under. Later, Clara is
with the other women.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Like pretty maids all in a row. The process improves with
every attempt. Mister Sweet is such a clever old thing. Oh, into the
canal with the rejects, Ada. <br>
ADA: Yes. <br>
(But one of the rejects takes Ada's hand.) <br>
ADA: Ma. <br>
(Ada shackles the Doctor in the secret room.) <br>
ADA: Sometimes the preservation process goes wrong. Only Mister Sweet
knows why, and only Mama is allowed to talk to Mister Sweet. But if
you're very good, you can stay here. You'll be my secret. My special
monster. Shush. <br>
(And there he stays until Edmund, another living reject of the process,
bursts in. Which is why his image was in Edmund's eye.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Factory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Poor Edmund must have come looking for us
and then fallen into a vat of the pure venom. Or was pushed. Didn't
stand a chance. <br>
JENNY: What is that stuff, though? <br>
DOCTOR: Deadly poison. And Mrs Gillyflower's been dipping her pilgrims
in a dilute form to protect them. Preserve them. Process didn't work on
me. Maybe because I'm not human. I ended up on the reject pile. <br>
JENNY: Preserve them against what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, according to her, the coming apocalypse.<br>
&nbsp;(The Doctor makes the universal cu-koo gesture.) <br>
JENNY: When the End of Days is come and judgement rains down upon us
all. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
JENNY: Nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. What? <br>
JENNY: Something Mrs Gillyflower said. One of her sermons. Madame will
come looking for me. We'd best get on. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Clara. Got to find Clara. <br>
JENNY: But, Doctor. Clara's dead. Isn't she? <br>

execution? The usual story. Fourth one this week, and I'm not even
hungry. <br>

STRAX: Do you know it? <br>
URCHIN: Turn around when possible. Then, at the end of the road, turn
right. <br>

ADA: A young man. Unlike the others, he survived rejection. He must be
strong. Worthy of salvation. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Wrecker. Berserker! You have loosed a reject onto the

STRAX: What now, madam? We could lay mimetic cluster mines. <br>
VASTRA: Strax. <br>
STRAX: Or dig trenches and fill them with acid. <br>
VASTRA: Strax! You're overexcited. Have you been eating Miss Jenny's
sherbet fancies again? <br>
STRAX: No. <br>
VASTRA: Go outside and wait for me until I call for you. <br>
STRAX: But madam, I <br>
VASTRA: Go! <br>
STRAX: I'm going to go play with my grenades. <br>
(Strax leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, I think she's about done. <br>
(The Doctor opens the cubicle.) <br>
DOCTOR: I know who you think she is, but she isn't. She can't be. <br>
VASTRA: I was right, then. You and Clara have unfinished business. <br>
(Clara falls into the Doctor's arms.) <br>
DOCTOR: There, there. Hello, stranger. <br>
CLARA: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha. <br>
CLARA: Hi. What's going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, haven't you heard, love? There's trouble at mill. She's a
lizard. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Factory corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> VASTRA: My people once ruled this world, as well
you know, but we did not rule it alone. Just as humanity fights a daily
battle against nature, so did we. And our greatest plague, the most
virulent enemy, was the repulsive red leech. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, the Repulsive Red Leech. Nah. On balance I think I prefer
the Crimson Horror. What was it, exactly? <br>
VASTRA: A tiny parasite. It infected our drinking water. And once in
our systems, it secreted a fatal poison. <br>
DOCTOR: If it's been hanging around, lurking in the shadows, maybe it's
evolved. Or maybe it's had help. <br>
CLARA: Doctor, I've been thinking. The chimney <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Way past that now. Yucky red
parasite from the time of the dinosaurs pitches up in Victorian
Yorkshire. Didn't see that one coming. <br>
CLARA: Yeah, but the chimney <br>
DOCTOR: But what's the connection to Mrs Gillyflower? Judgement will
rain down on us all. An empty mill. <br>
CLARA: A chimney that doesn't blow smoke. <br>
DOCTOR: Clever clogs. <br>
CLARA: Missed me? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, lots. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Boiler room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: She's going to poison the air. <br>
JENNY: How? <br>
(A pilgrim pulls a lever. They are looking at the base of a rocket.) <br>
CLARA: With that, I should think. <br>
DOCTOR: And there's the poison. All right, gang, I've got a plan. <br>
(They stand up and something metal clatters. They duck down as the
pilgrims turn towards the sound.) <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Okay. <br>
(Mrs Gillyflower pulls out the stops on a small pipe organ then presses
a lever. The contraption turns to present a control board to her.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Secret room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Ada is still crying in the corner when the Doctor
and Clara enter.) <br>
ADA: Who is that? Who is there? <br>
(The Doctor takes her hand and runs it over his face.) <br>
ADA: You. It's you. My monster. You've come back. But you're <br>
DOCTOR: Warm. And alive, thanks to you, Ada. You saved me from your
mother's human rubbish tip. Now then, what's wrong? <br>
ADA: She does not want me, monster. I am not to be chosen. Perhaps it
was my own sin, the blackness in my heart that my father saw in me. <br>
DOCTOR: Ada, no. That's nonsense. Stupid, backward nonsense, and you
know it. You know it. <br>
CLARA: What is it? <br>
ADA: Who is that? <br>
CLARA: I'm, I'm a friend. A friend of his. <br>
ADA: Then you are fortunate indeed. It isn't good to be alone. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Ada, I need you to tell me something. Who is Mister Sweet?
Ada? <br>
ADA: Oh, dear monster <br>
DOCTOR: Please, tell me. <br>
ADA: I cannot. Even now, I cannot. I cannot betray Mama. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, come with us, then. There's something you need to know. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Drawing room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (This is where the control mechanism is.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Oh, you do seem to keep turning up like a bad penny, young
man. <br>
DOCTOR: Force of habit. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Can I offer you something? Tea? Seed cake? Oh, a glass of
Amontillado? <br>
DOCTOR: No, thanks. We've had a skinful already, as you might say. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Ha, ha. Very funny. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm the Doctor, you're nuts and I'm going to stop you. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: I'm afraid Mister Sweet and I cannot allow that. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Would it be impolite to ask why you and Mister Sweet
are petrifying your workforce with diluted prehistoric leech venom? <br>
CLARA: So when do we get to meet him, this silent partner of yours?
Why's he so shy. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Mister Sweet is always with us. <br>
DOCTOR: You seem to have a very close relationship, you and your pal. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Oh yes, Doctor. Exceedingly close. Symbiotic, you might
say. <br>
(She opens the top of her dress to reveal a large red leech attached to
her skin. Meanwhile, the pilgrims continue to load bottles of venom
into the rocket.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor, what is it? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: A survivor. He has grown fat on the filth humanity has
pumped into the rivers. That's where I found him. <br>
DOCTOR: Very enterprising. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: His needs are simple, and in return he gives me his
nectar. <br>
DOCTOR: Mrs Gillyflower, you have no idea what you are dealing with. In
the wrong hands, that venom could wipe out all life on this planet. <br>
(Mrs Gillyflower holds out her hands.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Do you know what these are? Ha, ha! The wrong hands. <br>
(She goes to the control panel and pulls a lever. Red lights come on
all the way up the factory chimney. Young Thomas Thomas points them out
to Strax.) <br>
DOCTOR: Planning a little fireworks party, are we? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: You have forced me to advance the Great Work somewhat,
Doctor, but my colossal scheme remains as it was. My rocket will
explode high in the atmosphere, raining down Mister Sweet's beneficence
onto all humanity. <br>
CLARA: And wiping us all out. You can't! <br>
GILLYFLOWER: My new Adam and Eves will sleep for but a few months
before stepping out into a golden dawn. Is it not beautiful, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Now, tell us about Ada, Mrs Gillyflower. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Your daughter. You do remember your daughter? Tell us about
your daughter. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: How can you speak of such trivia when my hour is at hand?
The child is of no consequence. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that why you experimented on her? <br>
CLARA: Experimented? <br>
DOCTOR: The signs are all there. The pattern of scarring. You used her
as a guinea pig, didn't you. <br>
CLARA: God. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Sometimes sacrifices must be made. <br>
DOCTOR: Sacrifices? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: It was necessary. I had to find out how much of the venom
would produce an anti-toxin to immunise myself. Don't you see? It was
necessary! <br>
ADA: Mama? Is it, is it true? <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Ada. <br>
ADA: It is. It's true. True. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Ada, listen to me. <br>
ADA: You hag! You perfidious hag! You virago! You harpy! All these
years I have helped you, served you, looked after you. Do they count
for nothing, nothing at all? <br>
(Ada starts slashing at her mother with her white stick.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: No, stop. Stop. <br>
(Clara runs forward.) <br>
DOCTOR: Hang on, I've got a sonic screwdriver. <br>
CLARA: Yeah? I've got a chair! <br>
(Clara smashes it into the control panel, with a satisfying shower of
sparks.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: No! <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. That worked. I'm afraid your rocket isn't going anywhere,
Mrs G. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Please, come to me, Ada. Oh, my child. You have always
been so very useful. <br>
(Mrs Gillyflower puts a small revolver to Ada's head.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, Mrs Gillyflower. <br>
ADA: Please, Mama. No more. No more. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: And now, if you'll please forgive us, we must be going. It
is long past Ada's bedtime. <br>
(Mrs Gillyflower forces Ada out of the room and locks the door behind
her.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, Clara. If we follow straight after her, she'll shoot
Ada on the spot. <br>
CLARA: She wouldn't. <br>
DOCTOR: She would. Chairs are useful. <br>
(He pulls the chair out of the panel and uses it to break the window.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Factory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GILLYFLOWER: Come along, Ada. Don't dawdle. <br>
ADA: Please, Mama, stop. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Has the venom been loaded? <br>
PILGRIM: Yes, ma'am. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Then heaven awaits you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[By the rocket]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Mrs Gillyflower drags Ada up the staircase
encircling the rocket. The Doctor and Clara run through Sweetville and
get to the bottom of the stairs.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Stop! <br>
DOCTOR: Just let her go, Mrs Gillyflower. Let Ada go. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Secondary firing mechanism, Doctor. Mister Sweet and I are
too smart for you, after all. <br>
DOCTOR: Just let your daughter go, Mrs Gillyflower. <br>
(Ada gets free and stumbles down to the corner between the Doctor and
Mrs Gillyflower.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Ada! <br>
ADA: Shoot if you wish, Mama. It is of no matter, for you killed me a
long time ago. <br>
(Mrs Gillyflower shoots at the Doctor, making him retreat.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: (sings) I'll labour night and day to be a pilgrim. <br>
(The Doctor gets to Ada as Mrs Gillyflower pulls the lever and the
rocket's engines ignite. He shields her with his body as it takes off,
with so little flame as to not even singe any of them as it passes mere
inches away.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Now, Mister Sweet, now the whole world will taste your
lethal kiss! <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so, Mrs Gillyflower. <br>
(The Doctor snaps his fingers. Jenny and Vastra appear, in pilgrim
clothes, holding a bottle of venom.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Very well, then. If I can't take the world with me, you
will have to do. Die, you freaks. Die! Die! <br>
(Strax points his honking big gun down the chimney.) <br>
STRAX: Put down your weapon, human female. <br>
(Mrs Gillyflower shoots at Strax. He returns fire, sending her tumbling
over the railing to the floor two stories below.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ouch. <br>
(The leech detaches itself from her, and drags itself across the floor
by its suckered forelimbs.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: No. No. Mister Sweet, where are you going? You can't leave
me now, Mister Sweet. <br>
CLARA: What's it doing? <br>
DOCTOR: It knows she's dying. She's no longer of any use to it. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Mister Sweet. Ada? <br>
(Ada taps her way down the stairs.) <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Ada. Are you there? <br>
ADA: I'm here, Mama. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: Forgive me, my child. Forgive me. <br>
ADA: Never. <br>
GILLYFLOWER: That's my girl. <br>
(Mrs Winifred Gillyflower dies. The rocket explodes in the sky.) <br>
JENNY: What will you do with that thing? <br>
DOCTOR: Take it back to the Jurassic era, maybe. Out of harm's way. <br>
(Ada taps her way across the floor until her stick finds something
squishy. She smashes the leech to smithereens.) <br>
DOCTOR: On the other hand </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Right. Right, London. We were heading for
London, weren't we? <br>
CLARA: Was there any particular reason? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No. Just thought you might like it. <br>
CLARA: Yeah. Maybe had enough of Victorian values for a bit. <br>
DOCTOR: You're the boss. <br>
CLARA: Am I? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No. Get in. <br>
(Clara enters the Tardis. The Doctor walks back to Ada and the
Paternoster Gang.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, Ada, I'd love to stay and help clear up the mess, but <br>
ADA: I know, dear monster. You have things to do. <br>
DOCTOR: And what about you? <br>
ADA: Oh, there are many things a bright young lady can do to occupy her
time. It's time I stepped out of the darkness and into the light. <br>
DOCTOR: Good luck, Ada. You know, I think you will be just <br>
(He kisses her cheek.) <br>
DOCTOR: Splendid. Well, thanks a million, you three, as ever. Have some
Pontefract cakes on me. I love Pontefract cakes. See you around, eh, I
shouldn't wonder. <br>
JENNY: But Doctor. That girl, Clara. You haven't explained. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I haven't. <br>
(He goes to the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, look at the muck in here. Right! <br>
(He goes into the Tardis. Strax takes the bottle of venom from Vastra.)
<br>
STRAX: Another one for the vault. <br>
THURSDAY: Ah, there you are. I called to see whether there had been any
progress. <br>

CLARA: I am the boss. <br>
(Then she spots the laptop that the children have left open. On the
screen are photographs of her and the Doctor from their recent
adventures. 1983 Firebird - the Russian Submarine, the haunted house.) <br>
ANGIE: It's you, isn't it. It's from the seventies, but it's definitely
you. <br>
CLARA: Of course it's not. <br>
ARTIE: And that's you too, from 1983. I found it at school. <br>
CLARA: No, that's just someone who looks like me. <br>
ANGIE: And that's someone that looks like your boyfriend. <br>
ARTIE: Is he an alien? <br>
ANGIE: Why would he be an alien? <br>
ARTIE: The chin. <br>
ANGIE: And the time travel? <br>
(Angie clicks on a third image, of Victorian Governess Clara.) <br>
CLARA: That's not right. <br>
ANGIE: You were in Victorian London. <br>
CLARA: No, I was in Victorian Yorkshire. <br>
ANGIE: How come you didn't tell us? <br>
ARTIE: Time travel, that's so cool. <br>
ANGIE: Can we have a go? <br>
CLARA: Can you have a what? <br>
ARTIE: We want a shot at the time machine. <br>
CLARA: No, no, no, no. Listen <br>
ANGIE: Okay. Or, we'll have to tell Dad that our nanny's a time
traveller. </font> </p>
