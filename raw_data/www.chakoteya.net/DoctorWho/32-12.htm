KELLY: Better cash up then. Suppose John Joe can just wait for me. <br>
SHONA: No, I'll do it. You head off. <br>
(The lights flicker again.) <br>
KELLY: When's the council going to fix this? Last night my telly went
off in the middle of Top Model. <br>

CRAIG: I saw it. <br>
SOPHIE: And I've labelled the food and sort of numbered it. <br>
CRAIG: Sophie, you don't need to number food. <br>
SOPHIE: It's just a suggestion. Also, my mum might phone. <br>
CRAIG: Might? <br>
SOPHIE: And your Mum, and my Dad, and you know, just some people. <br>
CRAIG: I can cope on my own. Now, please go and have a rest. You need
it. I love you. <br>
SOPHIE: I love you, too. And thank you for this. And I do know you can
cope on your own. And I may have drawn some arrows in the fridge. <br>

you've redecorated. I don't like it. <br>
CRAIG: It's a different house. We moved. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it. <br>

DOCTOR: Social call. Thought it was about time I tried one out. How are
you? <br>
CRAIG: I'm fine. <br>
DOCTOR: This is the bit where I say I'm fine too, isn't it? I'm fine,
too. Good. Love to Sophie. Bye. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: So when you say on your own <br>
CRAIG: Yes, I meant on my own with the baby. Yes. Because no one thinks
I can cope on my own. Which is so unfair, because I can't cope on my
own with him. I can't. He just cries all the time. I mean, do they have
off switches? <br>
DOCTOR: Human beings. No. Believe me, I've checked. <br>
CRAIG: No, babies. <br>
DOCTOR: Same difference. Sometimes this works though. Shush. <br>
(Alfie goes quiet.) <br>
CRAIG: Can you teach me to do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Probably not. <br>
CRAIG: Oh, please. Come on, I need something. I'm rubbish at this. <br>
DOCTOR: At what? <br>
CRAIG: Being a dad. You read all the books, and they tell you you'll
know what to do if you follow your instincts. I have no instinct.
That's what this weekend's about, trying to prove to people I can do
this one thing well. <br>
(The Doctor is flicking through the books on the table. He laughs at
Daisy's Wild Ride.) <br>
DOCTOR: So, what did you call him? Will I blush? <br>
CRAIG: No, we didn't call him the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I didn't think you would. <br>
CRAIG: He's called Alfie. What are you doing here anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he likes that, Alfie, though personally he prefers to be
called Stormageddon, Dark Lord Of All. <br>
CRAIG: Sorry, what? <br>
DOCTOR: That's what he calls himself. <br>
CRAIG: And how do you know that? <br>
DOCTOR: I speak baby. <br>
CRAIG: Of course you do. I don't even know when his nappy needs
changing, and I'm the one supposed to be his dad. Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. He's wondering where his mum is? Where is Sophie? <br>
CRAIG: She's gone away with Melina for the weekend. She needs a rest. <br>
DOCTOR: No, he's your dad. You can't just call him Not Mum. <br>
CRAIG: Not Mum? <br>
DOCTOR: That's you. Also Not Mum, that's me. And everybody else is
peasants. That's a bit unfortunate. <br>
CRAIG: What are you here for? What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: I just popped in to say hello. <br>
CRAIG: You don't do that. I checked upstairs when we moved, it's real.
And next door, both sides, they're humans. Is it the fridge? Are there
aliens in my fridge? <br>
DOCTOR: I just want to see you, Craig! Cross my hearts. I've been
knocking about on my own for a bit. Bit of a farewell tour. One last
thing, popping in to see you, then I'm off to the Alignment of Exedor. <br>
CRAIG: The Alignment of Exedor? <br>
DOCTOR: Seventeen galaxies in perfect unison. Meant to be spectacular.
I can't miss it. Literally can't. It's locked in a time stasis field. I
get one crack at flying my Tardis straight into it, if I get my dates
right. Which I have. <br>
CRAIG: Sounds nice. <br>
(The Doctor looks through the local paper.) <br>
DOCTOR: So this is me, popping in and popping out again. Just being
social. Just having a laugh. Never mind that. <br>
CRAIG: Never mind what? <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing. <br>
CRAIG: No, you've noticed something. You've got your noticing face on.
I have nightmares about that face. <br>
DOCTOR: Ooo, nope, given up all that. Done noticing things. I didn't
even notice that, for example. Well, got to go. Good seeing you, Craig.
Goodbye, Stormageddon. <br>
CRAIG: No, no, wait, wait. Can you do the shushing thing? <br>
DOCTOR: No, it only works once, and only on life forms with
underdeveloped brains. <br>
CRAIG: Hang on. You said farewell tour. What do you mean, farewell? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR; Just go. Stop noticing. Just go. Stop
noticing, just go. Stop noticing, just go. Stop it. Am I noticing? No.
No, I am not. And what I am not doing is scanning for electrical
fluctuations. Oh, shut up, you. I'm just dropping in on a friend. The
last thing I need right now is a patina of teleport energy. I'm going.
Do you hear me? Going. Not staying, going. I am through saving them. I
am going away now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is demonstrating a remote control
helicopter to a group of children.) <br>
DOCTOR: It goes up tiddly up, it goes down tiddly down for only forty
nine ninety nine, which I personally think is a bit steep, but then
again it's your parents' cash and they'll only waste it on boring stuff
like lamps and vegetables. Yawn! <br>
CRAIG: Yeah, Soph. Just enjoy your holiday. Yeah, coping. <br>
DOCTOR: Nobody panic, but I appear to be losing control. <br>
(The helicopter crashes near Craig.) <br>
CRAIG: Yeah, love you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oops. Guys, guys, ladies and gentlemen. While I deal with this
awkward moment, you go and find your parents slash guardians. Try in
lamps. Craig! <br>
CRAIG: What the hell are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I work in a shop now. Here to help. Look, they
gave me a badge with my name on in case I forget who I am. Very
thoughtful, as that does happen. <br>
CRAIG: You were leaving. The Alignment of Exeter, what about that? One
chance to see it, you said. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I was on my way, you know. Saw a shop, got a job. You got
to live in the moment. Craig, mind Yappy. <br>
CRAIG: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Yappy. The robot dog. Not so much fun as I remember. You look
awful. <br>
CRAIG: I haven't slept, have I? I still can't stop him crying. I even
tried singing to him last night. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, he did mention that he thought you were crying, too. He
didn't get a wink. Yappy, say goodbye to Craig and Stormageddon.
Goodbye, Craig. Goodbye, Stormageddon. <br>
(As the Doctor puts down the little robot dog, something whizzes past
the end of the aisle.) <br>
DOCTOR: What was that? <br>
CRAIG: You're here for a reason, aren't you? You noticed something, and
you're investigating it. And because it's you, it's going to be
dangerous and alien. <br>
DOCTOR: Might not be. <br>
CRAIG: Doctor, I live here. I need to know. <br>
DOCTOR: No, you don't. <br>
CRAIG: My baby lives here. My son. <br>
DOCTOR: Sheila Clark went missing Tuesday. Atif Ghosh last seen Friday.
Tom Luker last seen Sunday. <br>
CRAIG: Why's none of this on the front page? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, page one has an exclusive on Nina, a local girl who got
kicked off Britain's Got Talent. These people are on pages seven,
nineteen, twenty two. Because no one's noticed yet. They're far too
excited about Nina's emotional journey, which in fairness, is quite
inspiring. <br>

just happen to coincide with the disappearances. <br>
CRAIG: That's just the council putting in new cables, isn't it? <br>
(He stops at an Out Of Order lift.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, that's it. Mystery solved. Wasting my time. Now, you
can go home and I can go to Exedor. Goodbye. <br>
(He uses his sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: And here's the lift. <br>
CRAIG: It says it's out of order. <br>
DOCTOR: Not any more. See? Here to help. <br>
CRAIG: It says danger. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish. Lifts aren't dangerous. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Just between you, me and Stormy, don't want
to frighten me punters. Someone's been using a teleport relay right
here in this shop. Missing people last seen in this area. Before you
ask, CCTV's been wiped. <br>
CRAIG: A teleport? A teleport? A teleport like, a beam me up teleport,
like you see in Star Trek? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. Someone's been using a beam me up Star Trek teleport.
Could be disguised as anything. <br>
(There are six circles in a circle on the ceiling.) <br>

DOCTOR: (strangled) Yes, that's it. That's all. It's the lights. <br>
CRAIG: Why did you say that like that? <br>
DOCTOR: Like what? <br>
CRAIG: Like that, in that high pitched voice. <br>
DOCTOR: Just keep looking at me, Craig. Right at me. Just keep looking.
<br>
CRAIG: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, because, because, because I love you. <br>
CRAIG: You love me? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Craig. It's you. It's always been you. <br>
CRAIG: Me? <br>
DOCTOR: Is that so surprising? <br>
(The Doctor puts his arms around Craig's neck and uses the sonic
screwdriver on whatever it behind the definitely not a lift any more
scene behind him.) <br>
CRAIG: Doctor, are you going to kiss me? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Craig. Yes, I am. Would you like that? Bit out of
practice, but I've had some wonderful feedback. <br>
CRAIG: Doctor, no. I can't. I'm taken. <br>

CRAIG: Oh, my God! <br>
DOCTOR: Or we could just hold hands if it make you'd feel more
comfortable. <br>

DOCTOR: It's got to be up there somewhere. Can't get a fix. It must be
shielded. <br>
CRAIG: But you fused the teleport. You sorted it. They can't come back.
<br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, I've just bought myself a little time. Still got to
work out what they're doing before I can stop it. <br>
CRAIG: But if they've got the teleport and they're that evil, why
haven't they invaded already? <br>
DOCTOR: Craig, take Alfie and go. <br>
CRAIG: No. <br>
DOCTOR: No? <br>
CRAIG: No. I remember from last time, people got killed. People that
didn't know you. I know where it's safest for me and Alfie, and that's
right next to you. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that so? <br>
CRAIG: Yeah. You always win. You always survive. <br>
DOCTOR: Those were the days. <br>

CRAIG: Where am I investigating? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, look round. Ask questions. People like it when you're
with a baby. Babies are sweet. People talk to you. That's why I usually
take a human with me. <br>
CRAIG: So, I'm your baby? <br>
DOCTOR: You're my baby. <br>

VAL: Hope you don't mind me saying, Doctor, but I think you look ever
so sweet, you and your partner and the baby. <br>
DOCTOR: Partner. Yes, I like it. Is it better than companion? <br>
VAL: Companion sounds old-fashioned. There's no need to be coy these
days. <br>
DOCTOR: You've not noticed anything unusual around here lately, Val? <br>
VAL: Well <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes? <br>
VAL: Mary Warnock saw Don Petheridge snogging Andrea Groom outside the
Conservative Club on his so-called day off golfing. <br>

DOCTOR: Let's ask it. We wait for the shop to shut. We stake the place
out and grab ourselves a Cybermat. <br>

KOVARIAN: Such a lovely old song. But is it about him? <br>
RIVER: You know about the Doctor? <br>
KOVARIAN: So very well. Oh, don't try and remember me. We've been far
too thorough with your dear little head. <br>
(Two Silence creep up behind River.) <br>
RIVER: Oh! What are they? What are those things? <br>
KOVARIAN: Your owners. <br>
RIVER: My what? <br>
KOVARIAN: So, they made you a Doctor today, did they? Doctor River
Song. How clever you are. You understand what this is, don't you? <br>
RIVER: According to some accounts, it's the day the Doctor dies. <br>
KOVARIAN: By Silencio Lake, on the Plain of Sighs, an Impossible
Astronaut will rise from the deep and strike the Time Lord dead. <br>
RIVER: It's a story. <br>
KOVARIAN: And this is where it begins. <br>
(Two soldiers enter with a NASA spacesuit.) <br>
KOVARIAN: You never really escaped us, Melody Pond. We were always
coming for you. <br>
RIVER: How do you know who I am? <br>
KOVARIAN: I made you what you are. The woman who kills the Doctor. <br>
RIVER: No! No! No! <br>
(River is injected with a sedative.) <br>
KOVARIAN: Tick tock, goes the clock, and all the years they fly. Tick
tock, and all too soon, your love will surely die. <br>
(River wakes up in the spacesuit, under water.) <br>
CHILDREN [OC]: Tick tock goes the clock, the cradle now be rocked. Tick
