<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (On Earth, in a rural part of the London Borough
of Barnet, a genuine policeman is using a genuine blue police box to
telephone the station. His words are muffled by the nearby traffic
noises. He has propped his bicycle up against the box and is just
dropping his rubbish in a nearby bin when the police box whibbles, and
his connection is interrupted. It sounds as if a Tardis has just
materialised in the police box. As the policeman tries to re-establish
communications, the door opens and he is dragged inside. There is the
sound of evil laughter.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cloister room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is pacing amongst the ivy-clad pillars
of this inner part of the Tardis.) <br>
ADRIC: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Chameleon circuit. <br>
ADRIC: What? Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, whenever you see me in this part of the Tardis, pacing up
and down like this, be a good chap and don't interrupt me, will you,
unless it's terribly urgent. It's not terribly urgent, is it? <br>
ADRIC: Well, no. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, so now you'll know in fact there's no need for you to
come barging in here at all, but if it is terribly urgent you can
always ring the Cloister Bell. <br>
ADRIC: The Cloister Bell? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ADRIC: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a sort of communications device reserved for wild
catastrophes and sudden calls to man the battle stations. <br>
ADRIC: But the Tardis doesn't have battle stations. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, nothing along those lines. I sometimes think I
should be running a tighter ship. <br>
ADRIC: A tighter ship? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. The second law of thermodynamics is taking its toll on the
old thing. Entropy increases. <br>
ADRIC: Entropy increases? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, daily. The more you put things together, the more they
keep falling apart, and that's the essence of the second law of
thermodynamics and I never heard a truer word spoken. Come on. Come on.
<br>
(They sit on a small stone bench.) <br>
DOCTOR: Have you seen the state of the time column recently? Wheezing
like a grampus. <br>
ADRIC: But it will get us to Gallifrey, won't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Gallifrey? Oh yes, yes. Are you really set on going to
Gallifrey? <br>
ADRIC: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. <br>
ADRIC: That is where we're going, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: That's one of the questions I was just pondering. There's bound
to be an awful lot of fuss about Romana. Why she stayed in E-space,
official investigations, that sort of thing. <br>
ADRIC: The Time Lords won't approve? <br>
DOCTOR: What? She has broken the cardinal rule of Gallifrey. She has
become involved, and in a pretty permanent sort of way. I think that
you and I should let a few oceans flow under a few bridges before we
head back home. <br>
ADRIC: So we don't get to go to Gallifrey. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Let me put another question to you. I have a place in mind
that's on the way, well, more or less, give or take a parsec or two.
It's my home from home. It's called Earth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Battersea, London]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A young Australian woman in purple air stewardess
uniform comes out of a house on Ursula Street, then remembers
something. Her aunt is waiting for her in a tiny soft-top convertible
car. Everyone say Hi to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0276148/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Janet Fielding</a>.) <br>
TEGAN: Passport. <br>
VANESSA: Oh, she's going to go back in there. Forget her head if it
wasn't screwed on, I tell you. <br>
(The little car refuses to start. Tegan comes back out of the house
again and gets into the car.) <br>
VANESSA: There we go. <br>
TEGAN: Okay, Aunty Vanessa, let's go. More choke. Easy on the throttle
as you turn her over. <br>
VANESSA: While I do that, dear, I wonder if you'd mind shutting the
front door. <br>
(The door to number 43 is standing ajar.) <br>
VANESSA: And don't forget your bag. You might need it. <br>
TEGAN: Rats. I promise I'll get organised one day. <br>
VANESSA: Now calm now, Tegan, dear. Look, we've got plenty of time. You
get yourself so excited. <br>
(Tegan runs back to the house as a plane passes overhead.) <br>
VANESSA: Wish you and I had half her energy, though. <br>
(Tegan returns with her bag, after finally remembering to close the
door.) <br>
TEGAN: Sorry, Aunty. First flight nerves, I guess. Here, let me have a
go. <br>
VANESSA: That's a good idea. I'm not having any luck here with it at
all this morning. It's really very cold. <br>
TEGAN: It's cold. <br>
(Tegan takes over the driver's seat.) <br>
VANESSA: There we are. Got all your things? Right. <br>
(Tegan turns the key and the engine starts first time.) <br>
TEGAN: I've got the knack. <br>
VANESSA: You sure have. <br>
TEGAN: Ladies and gentlemen. Although the fasten seatbelt sign is now
off, we suggest that you keep your seatbelt fastened when seated. If
necessary, you may move about the cabin. Smoking is now permitted. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cloister room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ADRIC: Earth's the planet with all the oceans,
isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: That's the chap. <br>
ADRIC: Wet. <br>
DOCTOR: Britain is. That's the one place where we can find these blue
boxes. <br>
ADRIC: Tardises? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but they're not. No spacious accommodation, no viewer
screens. They don't even time travel. Just elementary Earth
communications devices, and more or less obsolete by the time we'll be
arriving there. There's some in the North that are still in use. <br>
ADRIC: But we've got communications devices. <br>
DOCTOR: But not a police box. <br>
ADRIC: A police box? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. What the mathematical model of a Tardis exterior is based
upon. <br>
ADRIC: I'd like to see Earth, but why go all that way just to look at
something that looks like the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I want to measure it. <br>
ADRIC: Whatever for? <br>
DOCTOR: Block transfer computation. <br>
ADRIC: I've never heard of that. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not surprised. Logopolis is a quiet little planet. <br>
ADRIC: Logopolis? But I thought we were going to Earth? <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's the other place. We go to Logopolis afterwards. <br>
ADRIC: You mean we're going to measure Logopolis, too? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. It's all to do with the chameleon circuit problem.
We measure the police box on Earth, then we take the measurements
afterwards to Logopolis. Come on, I'll show you. <br>
(A bell begins to toll.) <br>
ADRIC: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: The Cloister Bell. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barnet lay-by]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The brave little car has got a flat tyre. Tegan
pulls into the lay-by with the blue police box.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ADRIC: It's stopped. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ADRIC: Well, what does it mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, nothing, when it's not ringing. <br>
ADRIC: But it did ring. Is there a wild catastrophe? <br>
DOCTOR: Apparently not. <br>
ADRIC: Well, something must have made it ring. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, or else our old friend entropy's nibbling away at the
system circuitry. Let's take a look. <br>
ADRIC: But you were saying about the chameleon circuit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barnet lay-by]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Hell's teeth, Aunty Vanessa. It is a flat. <br>
VANESSA: I thought there was something funny about that steering, but
you wouldn't listen to me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Well, it's only the exterior of a Tardis
that exists as a real space-time event. <br>
ADRIC: But mapped on to one of the interior continua. <br>
DOCTOR: Precisely. That's very good. <br>
ADRIC: So you can change it into anything you like. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well, that's a sore point. According to the handbook, yeah,
because the outer plasmic shell of a Tardis is driven by the chameleon
circuit, or so the theory runs. In practice I always meant to ask
Romana to help me fix it one day. <br>
(He opens the door to her room and they look in.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. I suppose we're going to miss Romana. <br>
ADRIC: And K9, too. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Still, the future lies this way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barnet lay-by]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Come on, Aunty. We've got to do something. <br>
VANESSA: Yeah. Telephone for help. <br>
TEGAN: Absolutely not. Cars. I hate 'em. <br>
VANESSA: That's not what you said when I offered you a lift. <br>
TEGAN: Sorry, Aunty, but you just don't get this sort of silly
aggravation with aircraft. <br>
VANESSA: Well, perhaps if we sit here and look helpless, someone might
offer us a lift. <br>
TEGAN: Pathetic. We'll crack this ourselves. Now then. <br>
(Tegan looks in the boot.) <br>
TEGAN: Where's the wheel spanner? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor and Adric finally get back to the
console room.) <br>
ADRIC: So the chameleon circuit's stuck? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
ADRIC: In Totter's Yard. <br>
DOCTOR: In a totter's yard. Anyway, it was ages ago. It doesn't matter.
She was in on Gallifrey for repair when I borrowed her. <br>
ADRIC: I thought she was yours? <br>
(The Doctor gets underneath the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, on a sort of finders-keepers basis, yes. I should have
waited till they'd done the chameleon conversion, but there were other
pressing reasons at the time. Anything happening up there? <br>
ADRIC: No. <br>
(A panel pops open and a control board comes out.) <br>
ADRIC: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Ah. <br>
ADRIC: What do these numbers and letters mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's an early version. The instructions have to be
punched in by machine code. <br>
ADRIC: Oh, how boring. <br>
DOCTOR: Boring? In theory we should be able to do things like this. <br>
(The Doctor hits a few keys and the scanner draws an outline of a
pyramid.) <br>
DOCTOR: There. You have a door there. <br>
ADRIC: Yes, I suppose that's useful. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we've got to be able to get in and out. <br>
ADRIC: No, no, I mean being able to change like that. <br>
DOCTOR: That's how the Master hid from us on Traken. Anyway, if this
worked, I'd just have to punch a few buttons like this, and we'd be a
pyramid. <br>
(The scanner diagram becomes the familiar police box in space.) <br>
ADRIC: It's very distinctive. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm not sure we should be distinctive. <br>
ADRIC: Why? Who's looking for us now? You've disposed of the Master. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. But since we left Traken, and then the Cloister Bell. <br>
ADRIC: Wild catastrophe? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>
ADRIC: Man the battle stations? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Ah, Earth. Nearly there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barnet lay-by]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Vanessa is reading from the car's handbook while
Tegan does the manual labour.) <br>
VANESSA: Completely remove the wheel-nuts, remove the hub trim,
exchange the road wheels and replace the hub trim and wheel-nuts. Oh,
dear. <br>
(Tegan is still struggling with one wheel nut when she looks up to see
an aeroplane passing overhead.) <br>
TEGAN: Now that's what I call travelling. <br>
VANESSA: You and your aeroplanes. I sometimes think you should have
been born with wings. <br>
(Clang!) <br>
TEGAN: Oh, rabbits. <br>
(The Tardis materialises unnoticed on the lay-by, near the real police
box.) <br>
VANESSA: By the way, dear, don't you think you should put a jack
underneath there before you take that wheel off? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: We've missed. <br>
ADRIC: What's supposed to happen? <br>
DOCTOR: At least, I suppose it's a miss, but I thought just for once
we'd materialise on the right coordinates. <br>
(The scanner shows the edge of the real police box and the two women
struggling with the car wheel.) <br>
DOCTOR: Two point six metres off target. What a landing. <br>
ADRIC: It's not bad for the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: That's what I just said. What a landing. No, no, no, no. Don't
open the door. <br>
ADRIC: Aren't we going out there to measure it? <br>
DOCTOR: There's no need to draw attention to ourselves. There's a
simpler way, if I can just organise it. The Tardis and I are getting
rather better at these short hops. <br>
(The policeman's bicycle falls over as the Tardis materialises around
the police box.) <br>
ADRIC: It's just like the Tardis! <br>
DOCTOR: I hope not. That could produce some unpleasant dimensional
anomalies. No, it's just an ordinary police box, around which we've
materialised with considerable finesse, I hope you've noticed. <br>
ADRIC: Police telephone, free for use of <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, leave it alone. <br>
(The Doctor puts the telephone back on it's cradle.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's a communications device. Adric, take down these
dimensions. I've been meaning to do this for centuries. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barnet lay-by]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan gets the spare wheel from the boot.) <br>
VANESSA: It's nearly done. <br>
TEGAN: I don't really belong at ground level, Aunt Vanessa. <br>
VANESSA: Yeah. <br>
TEGAN: I didn't mean to be rude about your car. It's very nice of you
to give me a lift to the airport. <br>
VANESSA: My little runabout's used to being insulted by now. <br>
(Across the road, a white figure watches from behind the fence.) <br>
TEGAN: Cars are all right, I guess. Just more fun to have your own
plane back home. What kind of a maintenance schedule are you running
here, Aunty Vanessa? This tyre's flat, too. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Three point six seven metres normal to the
back surface. <br>
ADRIC: How much more of this is there? <br>
DOCTOR: It has to be measured in every dimension. <br>
ADRIC: But it can't have thirty seven dimensions! You said it was an
ordinary Earth object. <br>
DOCTOR: In every dimension. I need every detail. The Logopolitans
convert that into a precise mathematical model. <br>
ADRIC: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, to overlay it on the Tardis. <br>
ADRIC: And that's block transfer computation. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's a way of modelling space-time events through pure
calculation. <br>
ADRIC: Really? <br>
DOCTOR: No, transcendentally. It's quite hard to explain in a word. <br>
ADRIC: Creating solid objects through pure mathematics. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I meant to do it all of course when they first offered to
do the chameleon conversion for me. It's highly specialised. But they
say it'll work. Leg up. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Barnet lay-by]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The mysterious Watcher sees Vanessa trying to
pump up the flat spare tyre.) <br>
VANESSA: Oh, please, dear, do let's get a man from the garage. <br>
TEGAN: No way. The stories I've heard about the way they exploit
helpless women. You want the job done well, you do it yourself, that's
what Dad used to say. <br>
VANESSA: Perhaps some knight errant will stop for us. <br>
TEGAN: You have to learn to fend for yourself in the outback, you know.
<br>
VANESSA: Your father's farm is hardly the outback, my dear, and neither
is this. You know, I can see a garage not even a quarter of a mile
away. <br>
TEGAN: Industry and application, Aunt Vanessa. Air stewardesses are
supposed to be resourceful. <br>
VANESSA: You're not an air stewardess yes, dear. <br>
TEGAN: I will be after today. <br>
VANESSA: If ever we get to the airport. <br>
TEGAN: We will, just as soon as I get this wheel off. <br>
VANESSA: Oh, god. You know, I thought I saw a man hovering over there.
Perhaps he needed a wave of encouragement. <br>
TEGAN: It's the 1980s, Aunt Vanessa. No knight errants. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Adric is on his stomach on top of the police
box.) <br>
ADRIC: So why do we have to go to Logopolis if the theory's as simple
as you say? <br>
DOCTOR: Because the actual working-out's incredibly tedious. Lots of
fiddly computations. Much better to leave it to the Logopolitans. They
do it standing on their heads. <br>
ADRIC: Not with a computer? <br>
DOCTOR: Standing on their heads is an expression. <br>
ADRIC: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: As a matter of fact, they don't use computers, they use word of
mouth. <br>
ADRIC: Is that another expression? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
ADRIC: They speak it? <br>
DOCTOR: Mutter. Intone. <br>
ADRIC: Intone the computations? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ADRIC: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: I've wondered that myself. I never quite had the nerve to ask
them. <br>
(An unexpected noise comes from the console. The Doctor rushes over to
it, and Adric joins him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Another instrumentation failure. <br>
ADRIC: A gravity bubble? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
(The Doctor hits the console and it starts beeping.) <br>
DOCTOR: Definitely a gravity bubble. Pretty local too, by the look of
it. <br>
ADRIC: Is that dangerous? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we'd better not dematerialise till I've investigated. I
have a feeling I'm overlooking the obvious again. Back in two shakes. <br>
(The Doctor stands in the Tardis doorway and looks at Vanessa and Tegan
arguing over the flat tyres. He is about to go back inside when he sees
the white figure across the road. Their eyes meet, then he goes back
inside. Adric is trying to pick the lock of the police box.) <br>
DOCTOR: What are you doing, Adric? <br>
ADRIC: I thought it might have something to do with the gravity bubble.
<br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
(The police box door creaks open invitingly.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you're right. No! You'd better leave this to me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor enters the police box and finds
himself in a more dimly lit console room. Adric has of course followed
him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Get back to the Tardis. <br>
ADRIC: But this is the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: A Tardis, perhaps. <br>
ADRIC: It looks just like yours. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, down to the last detail. No, wait, wait. <br>
(The second police box still has the telephone dangling on its wire.) <br>
DOCTOR: This could be terribly dangerous. You'd better stay with me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Vanessa has got the old flat tyre off its hub at
last.) <br>
VANESSA: There you are, Tegan, dear. I've got the knack too. <br>
TEGAN: I wish there was a knack to blowing up a spare tyre with a hole
in it. Really, Aunt Vanessa, what's the point in driving around with a
dud spare tyre? <br>
VANESSA: It's the garage, then. <br>
TEGAN: Crooks and swindlers, but I suppose we've got no choice. <br>
VANESSA: Unless we wait for a knight errant? <br>
TEGAN: No, thank you. Look, you stay here and get your breath back, and
I'll go. <br>
(Tegan sets off, rolling the flat tyre.) <br>
VANESSA: Take your bag, dear. You might have to pay for it. Ah, there's
a girl. Good girl. <br>
(Tegan stops at the police box and lets the tyre fall into a puddle.) <br>
TEGAN: (reads) Police telephone, free for use of public. Advice and
assistance obtainable immediately. Officers and cars respond to urgent
calls. Pull to open. <br>
(Instead, the door swings open.) <br>
TEGAN: That's funny. It's very peculiar indeed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Tegan enters as the 'police box' dematerialises

(She flicks a switch as if it is an intercom.) <br>
TEGAN: Hello? Anybody receiving me? Hello? Come in, anybody. My name's
Tegan Jovanka. I'd like to speak to the pilot. <br>

interested in such uses. Block transfer computation cannot be done with

DOCTOR: Bubble memory. <br>
TEGAN: Bubble memory. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. You realise what this means? <br>
TEGAN: No, as a matter of fact I don't, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Bubble memory is non-volatile. Remove the power and the bit
patterns are still retained in tiny magnetic domains in these chips.
The research team's final project is still here. <br>
TEGAN: Which would be great if we had a computer to run it on. <br>
DOCTOR: I've an idea where we could find one. On Earth. <br>

scientist is conducting music he is listening to on his headphones. He
leaves the room just before the Master's Tardis materialises and the
Doctor steps out, followed by the Master.) <br>

DOCTOR: Yes. I envy you your Tardis, Master. <br>
MASTER: Excellent, Doctor. Envy is the beginning of all true greatness.

DOCTOR: Shush. <br>
(He looks through the door to see the technician getting himself a
drink from a vending machine. They hide behind the Tardis as he comes
back. Once the man has settled back in his chair, the Master points a
device at him. The Doctor snatches it away.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
MASTER: It's the lightspeed overdrive, Doctor. You'll need that to
accelerate the signal from the transmitter. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry. I thought you meant to shoot him. <br>
MASTER: Oh, Doctor. You can explain. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>

his music.) <br>

drags the technician's chair aside. Tegan comes out of the Tardis.) <br>

MASTER: What makes you think this programme of the Monitor's is going
to work, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. It's a sort of vague faith in the nature of
things, I suppose. <br>
MASTER: It's in the very nature of things for entropy to win. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's the age-old battle, isn't it? Entropy versus
structure. Still, while there's life there's six of one and half a
dozen of the other. <br>

ADRIC: The Pharos Project on Earth. Now, I've got to set the exact
coordinates. Earth is in sector eighty twenty three of the third
quadrant. The temporal settings are laid in on this panel. It always
looks so easy when the Doctor does it. <br>
(Nyssa flicks the scanner switches. It shows a heavily condensed
cluster of galaxies.) <br>
NYSSA: Adric, the scanner. Adric. <br>
ADRIC: The whole universe. Of course. We're beyond space and time. <br>
NYSSA: That must be the entropy field. Where's the Earth? <br>
ADRIC: I can't see it. <br>
(The scanner zooms in on Sol and it's planetary system. Saturn is very
clear.) <br>

ADRIC: Earth's galaxy has a few more hours left. <br>
NYSSA: Adric, I can't see Traken. <br>

abandon this line of reasoning. <br>

(The Tardis materialises in some bushes below a giant radio telescope.
Jodrell Bank, probably, even though they are really at Crowsley Park
BBC receiver station with the big wire antennae stretched across
fields.) <br>
NYSSA: Just like Logopolis. <br>
ADRIC: The Earth people use it to beam messages to the stars. The
Doctor calls it reiterated invitation to alien intelligences in deep
space. <br>
NYSSA: And that's us. <br>

throws it away. This alerts a guard.) <br>

Adric and Nyssa are in the background.) <br>

his weapon in the grass. The Doctor reaches the telescope and goes up
to the control room. <br>

learned a great deal. And now I think it's time for you to go and
explain the presence of your friends. There's quite a hubbub outside. <br>

down that cable and the CVE would close forever. Even a humble

broadcast his message to the universe.) <br>

The Master runs back into the control room and changes the coordinates
of the antenna. The walkway begins to tilt as the antenna moves back
from vertical to horizontal. The Master watches from the doorway as the
Doctor tries to hang on. Meanwhile, guards climb the ladder to the
control room. The Doctor crawls to the other end of the walkway and
uses a wrench to try and stop the mechanism. He pulls out the cable,
