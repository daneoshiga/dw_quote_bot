ROSE: You don't know him. 'Cause he's not. I'm telling you, he's not.
And even if he was, how could I leave him all on his own, all the way
down there? No, I'm going to stay. <br>

would want? <br>
(Rose slumps back in her seat.) <br>

turn back. This is what the Doctor would have wanted. Isn't that right?

if you're getting this, Ida. Hope so. Anyway, they defeated the Beast
and imprisoned it. <br>
(He sees two bronze urns on a pedestals. There are two painted on the
wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Or maybe that's the key. <br>
(He touches one urn and they both light up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Or the gate, or the bars. <br>

chained to the wall by its horns and limbs.)

to fly away from a black hole. Toby, read me the stats. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: I accept that you exist. I don't have to
accept what you are, but you're physical existence, I'll give you that.
I don't understand. I was expected down here. I was given a safe
landing and air. You need me for something. What for? Have I got to, I
don't know, beg an audience? Or is there a ritual? Some sort of
incantation or summons or spell? All these things I don't believe in,
are they real? Speak to me! Tell me! You won't talk. Or you can't talk.
Oh, hold on, wait a minute, just let me. Oh! No. Yes! No. Think it
through. You spoke before. I heard your voice. An intelligent voice.
No, more than that. Brilliant. But, looking at you now, all I can see
is Beast. The animal. Just the body. You're just the body, the physical
form. What's happened to your mind, hmm? Where's it gone? Where's that
intelligence? Oh, no.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: You're imprisoned, long time ago. Before
the universe, after, sideways, in between, doesn't matter. The prison
is perfect. It's absolute, it's eternal. Oh, yes! Open the prison, the
gravity field collapses. This planet falls into the black hole! You
escape, you die. Brilliant! But that's just the body. The body is
trapped, that's all. The devil is an idea. In all those civilisations,
just an idea. But an idea is hard to kill. An idea could escape. The
mind. The mind of the great Beast. The mind can escape! Oh, but that's
it! You didn't give me air, your jailers did. They set this up all
those years ago! They need me alive, because if you're escaping, then
I've
got to stop you. If I destroy your prison, your body is destroyed. Your
mind with it. <br>
(The Doctor raises a rock to smash an urn, then drops it again.) <br>
DOCTOR: But then you're clever enough to use this whole system against
me. If I destroy this planet, I destroy the gravity field. The rocket.
The rocket loses protection and falls into the black hole. I have to
sacrifice Rose. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: It doesn't make sense. We escaped, but
there's a thousand ways it could've killed us. It could've ripped out
the air or, I don't know, burnt us, or anything. But it let us go. Why?
Unless it wanted us to escape? <br>
TOBY: Hey, Rose, do us a favour. Shut up. Almost there. We'll be beyond
the reach of the black hole in forty, thirty nine </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Pit]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: So, that's the trap. Or the test, or the
final judgment, I don't know. But if I kill you, I kill her. Except
that implies in this big grand scheme of Gods and Devils that she's
just a victim. But I've seen a lot of this universe. I've seen fake
gods and bad gods and demi-gods and would-be gods, and out of all that,
out of that whole pantheon, if I believe in one thing, just one thing,
I believe in her. <br>

fall inside a black hole. How about that? History. <br>
