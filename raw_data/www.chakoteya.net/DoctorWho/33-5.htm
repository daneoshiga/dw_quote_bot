the view of someone using a proper old-fashioned manual typewriter and
talking like a Raymond Chandler character.)<br>
GARNER [OC]: New York. The city of a million stories. Half of them are
true. The other half just haven't happened yet.
Statues, the man said. Living statues that moved in the dark.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Grayle's study]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(On the ground floor of a rich man's home.) <br>
GRAYLE: So, will you take the case, Mister Garner? <br>
GARNER: Sure. Why not? <br>
GRAYLE: Because you don't believe me. <br>
GARNER: For twenty five dollars a day plus expenses, I'll believe any
damn thing you like. <br>
GRAYLE: But you don't believe that statues can move. And you're right,
Mister Garner. They can't. Of course they can't. When you're looking. <br>
(Across the street, in the rain, is a statue of a woman and child.) <br>
GARNER: Good night, Mister Grayle. <br>
(Sam Garner leaves. Grayle looks out of the window again, and the woman
has vanished from the plinth across the road.) <br>
GARNER [OC]: The address Grayle gave me was an apartment block near
Battery Park.
He said it was where the statues lived. I asked him why he didn't go
look himself. He didn't answer.
Grayle was the scariest guy I knew. If something scared him, I kinda
wanted to shake its hand.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Winter Quay apartments]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The building is smothered in statuary, including a
Weeping Angel. A little girl looking out of a window covers her eyes,
then peeks out and covers them again. The doors open for Garner and he
goes inside. The Weeping Angel has removed her hands and is snarling.) <br>
GARNER: Hello? Hello? <br>
(The lift comes down for him. He steps inside and it goes up. The Angel
is in the foyer.) <br>
GARNER: What the? <br>
(Garner leaves the lift and goes along the red-carpeted corridor to
702, which has the nameplate S Garner. The door is unlocked and he goes
inside.) <br>
GARNER: Hello? Anyone home? <br>
(His had and coat are hanging on the rack, and his PI's id is in the
wallet. Older and more dog-eared, but the same one. Then he hears
someone grunting.) <br>
GARNER: Hello? <br>
(He looks at the old man in the bedroom.) <br>
GARNER: Who are you? <br>
OLD GARNER: They're coming for you. They're going to send you back. <br>
GARNER: Who's coming? Back where? <br>
OLD GARNER: In time. Back in time. I'm you. I'm you. <br>
(Garner leaves the apartment but is trapped between two Angels. There
are more on the stairs below, so he runs to the roof. A giant snarling
face is right behind him. Lady Liberty.) <br>
GARNER: You gotta be kiddin' me.

alien. I'm an Englishman in New York. <br>
(Picnicking near the Duck Pond.) <br>
DOCTOR: (reading) New York growled at my window, but I was ready for
it.
My stocking seams were straight, my lipstick was combat ready, and I
was packing cleavage that
could fell an ox at twenty feet. <br>
AMY: Doctor, you're doing it again. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm reading! <br>
AMY: Aloud. Please could you not? <br>
DOCTOR: There's something different about you, isn't there? <br>
RORY: What's the book? <br>
DOCTOR: Melody Malone. She's a private detective in old town New York. <br>
AMY: She's got ice in her heart and a kiss on her lips, and a
vulnerable side she keeps well hidden. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you've read it? <br>
AMY: You read it. Aloud. And then went yowzah! <br>
RORY: Only you could fancy someone in a book. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm just reading it. I just like the cover. <br>
AMY: Ooo, can we see the cover? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I'm busy. It's your hair! Is it your hair? <br>
AMY: Oh, shut up. It's the glasses. I'm wearing reading glasses now, on
my nose, see? There you go. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't like them. They make your eyes look all liney. No,
actually, sorry. They're fine. Carry on. <br>
RORY: Okay, I'm going to go and get us some more coffee. Who wants more
coffee? Me too. I'll go! <br>
AMY: Rory, do I have noticeable lines on my eyes now? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
RORY: No. <br>
AMY: You didn't look. <br>
RORY: I noticed them earlier. Didn't notice them. I specifically
remember not noticing them. <br>
AMY: You walk among fire pits, Centurion. <br>
RORY: Do I have to come over there? <br>
AMY: You can if you like. <br>
RORY: Well, we have company. <br>
AMY: I'll get a babysitter. <br>
(Rory and Amy kiss.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, do you know, it is so humiliating when you do that. <br>
RORY: Coffee? <br>
AMY: Coffee. <br>
DOCTOR: Can I have a go?&nbsp;<br>
(The Doctor puts on Amy's reading glasses.) <br>
DOCTOR; Oh, actually, that is much better. That is exciting. <br>
AMY: Read to me. <br>
DOCTOR: I thought you didn't like my reading aloud. <br>
AMY: Shut up, and read me a story. Just don't go yowzah. <br>
(The Doctor chuckles and tears out the last page of his book.) <br>
AMY: Why did you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have
to end. I hate endings. <br>
(He puts the page in the picnic basket.) <br>
DOCTOR: (reads) As I crossed the street, I saw the thin guy, but he
didn't see me. I guess that's how it began. <br>
(Rory is walking back with the coffees past a fountain with cherubs.
After he has past it, one of the cherubs is snarling, then it vanishes.
A child laughs. It's giggles make Rory keep looking around.) <br>
DOCTOR: (reads) I followed the skinny guy for two more blocks before he
turned and I could ask exactly what he was doing here.
He looked a little scared, so I gave him my best smile and my bluest
eyes. <br>
(Amy is playing Pooh sticks off the bridge.) <br>
AMY: Beware the yowzah. Do not, at this point, yowz. Doctor? What did
the skinny guy say? <br>
DOCTOR: He said, 'I just went to get coffees for the Doctor and Amy.
Hello, River.'

RIVER: I haven't the faintest idea, but you'll probably want to put
your hands up. <br>

puts his hands up. A big black man walks up behind River.) <br>

AMY: The Weeping Angels? <br>
DOCTOR: It makes sense. <br>
AMY: It makes what? <br>
DOCTOR: That's what happened to Rory. That's what the Angels do. It's
their preferred form of attack. They zap you back in time, let you live
to death. <br>
AMY: Well, we've got a time machine. We can just go and get him. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, tried that, if you've noticed, and we are back where we
started in 2012. <br>
AMY: We didn't start in a graveyard. What are we doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't know. Probably causally linked somehow. Doesn't matter.
Extractor fans on! <br>
AMY: Well, we're going to get there somehow. We're in the rest of the
book. <br>
DOCTOR: Doing what? <br>
AMY: Page 43, you're going to break something. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm what? <br>
AMY: (reads) 'Why do you have to break mine', I asked the Doctor. He
frowned and said, 'Because Amy read it in a book and now I have no
choice.' <br>
DOCTOR: Stop! No! No! Stop! You can't read ahead. You mustn't. And you
can't do that. <br>
AMY: But we've already been reading it. <br>
DOCTOR: Just the stuff that's happening now, in parallel with us.
That's as far as we go. <br>
AMY: But it could help us find Rory. <br>
DOCTOR: And if you read ahead and find that Rory dies? This isn't any
old future, Amy, it's ours. Once we know what's coming, it's fixed. 0
I'm going to break something, because you told me that I'm going to do
it. No choice now. <br>
AMY: Time can be rewritten. <br>
DOCTOR: Not once you've read it. Once we know what's coming, it's
written in stone. <br>

(An old man in the bed. He points at them, very 2001 A Space Odyssey.) <br>
OLD RORY: Amy. Amy, please. Amy, please. Please. <br>
AMY: Rory? He's you. <br>
OLD RORY: Amy. <br>
(Old Rory dies.) <br>
RORY: Will someone please tell me what is going on? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Rory, but you just died. <br>
(Chapter 11 Death at Winter Quay.) <br>
DOCTOR: This place is policed by Angels. Every time you try to escape,
you get zapped back in time. <br>
AMY: So this place belongs to the Angels? They built it? <br>
DOCTOR; Displacing someone back in time creates time energy, and that
is what the Angels feed on.
But normally, it's a one off, a hit and run. If they could keep hold of
their victims, feed off their time energy over and over again. This
place is a farm. A battery farm. How many Angels in New York? <br>
RIVER: It's like they've taken over every statue in the city. <br>
DOCTOR: The Angels take Manhattan because they can, because they've
never had a food source like this one. The city that never sleeps.
(Slow heavy footsteps outside the window.) <br>
RORY: What was that? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. But I think they're coming for you. <br>
RORY: What does that mean? What is going to happen to me? What is
physically going to happen? <br>
DOCTOR: The Angels will come for you. They'll zap you back in time to
this very spot, thirty, forty years ago. And you'll live out the rest
of your life in this room, until you die in that bed. <br>
RORY: And will Amy be there? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
AMY: How do you know? <br>
DOCTOR: Because he was so pleased to see you again. <br>
RORY: Okay. Well, they haven't taken me yet. What if I just run? What
if I just get the hell out of here? Then that never happens. <br>
DOCTOR; It's already happened. Rory, you've just witnessed your own
future. <br>
RIVER: Doctor, he's right. <br>
DOCTOR: No, he isn't. <br>
RIVER: If Rory got out, it would create a paradox. <br>
(Still the slow heavy footsteps.) <br>
AMY: What is that? <br>
RIVER: This is the Angels' food source. The paradox poisons the well.
It could kill them all. This whole place would literally unhappen. <br>
DOCTOR: It would be almost impossible. <br>
RIVER: Loving the almost. <br>
DOCTOR: But to create a paradox like that takes almost unimaginable
power. What have we got, eh? Tell me. Come on, what? <br>
AMY: I won't let them take him. That's what we've got. <br>
RORY: Whatever that thing is, it's getting closer. <br>
DOCTOR: Rory, even if you got out, you'd have to keep running for the
rest of your life. They would be chasing you for ever. <br>
AMY: Well, then. Better get started. <br>
(She opens the apartment door. There is an Angel outside.) <br>
AMY: Husband, run! <br>
(Amy and Rory run past the Angels. The lights flicker.) <br>
DOCTOR: River, I'm not sure this can work. <br>
RIVER: Husband, shut up. <br>

the room.) </font></p>

RORY: Er, no. But there's a way out. <br>

AMY: What are you doing? Rory, what are you doing? <br>
(Amy turns around and goes to him.) <br>
AMY: Rory, stop it. You'll die. <br>
RORY: Yeah, twice, in the same building on the same night. Who else
could do that? <br>
AMY: Just come down, please. <br>
RORY: This is the right thing to do. This will work. If I die now, it's
a paradox, right? The paradox kills the Angels. Tell me I'm wrong. Go
on, please, because I'm really scared. Oh, great. The one time you
can't manage it.
Amy, I'm going to need a little help here. <br>
(Rory takes Amy's hand and puts it on his chest.) <br>
AMY: Just stop it! <br>
RORY: Just think it through. This will work, this will kill the Angels.
<br>
AMY: It'll kill you too. <br>
RORY: Will it? River said that this place would be erased from time,
never existed. If this place never existed, what did I fall off? <br>
AMY: You think you'll come back to life? <br>
RORY: When don't I? <br>
AMY: Rory. <br>
RORY: And anyway, what else is there? Dying of old age downstairs,
never seeing you again? Amy, please. If you love me, then trust me, and
push. <br>
AMY: I can't. <br>
RORY: You have to! <br>
AMY: Could you? If it was me, could you do it? <br>
RORY: To save you, I'd do anything. <br>
(Amy gets up on the ledge next to Rory.) <br>
AMY: Prove it. <br>
RORY: No, I can't take you too. <br>
AMY: You said we'd come back to life. Money where your mouth is time. <br>

worked. We all pinged back where we belong. <br>
RORY: What, in a graveyard? <br>
AMY: This happened the last time. Why always here? <br>
DOCTOR: Does it matter? We got lucky. We could've blown New York off
the planet. I can't ever take the Tardis back there. The timelines are
too scrambled. I could have lost you both. Don't ever do that again. <br>
RORY: What did we do? We fixed it. We solved the problem. <br>
DOCTOR: I was talking to myself. <br>
(The Tardis has a bit of fire extinguisher damage. River appears from
behind it with a bucket of water and a rag.) <br>
RIVER: It could do with a repaint. <br>

love video games. <br>

(The Doctor sees Rory's gravestone - aged 82.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. Amelia, I'm so, so sorry. <br>
AMY: No. No, we can just go and get him in the Tardis. One more
paradox. <br>
DOCTOR: Would rip New York apart. <br>
AMY: No, that's not true. I don't believe you. <br>
RIVER: Mother, it's true. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, what are you doing? <br>
AMY: That gravestone, Rory's, there's room for one more name, isn't
there? <br>
DOCTOR: What are you talking about? Back away from the Angel. Come back
to the Tardis. We'll figure something out. <br>
AMY: The Angel, would it send me back to the same time? To him? <br>

AMY [OC]: Afterword, by Amelia Williams. Hello, old friend. And here we
are, you and me, on the last page.
By the time you read these words, Rory and I will be long gone. So know
that we lived well, and were very happy. And above all else, know that
we will love you always. Sometimes I do worry about you, though. I
think once we're gone, you won't be coming back here for a while, and
you might be alone, which you should never be. Don't be alone, Doctor.
And do one more thing for me. There's a little girl waiting in a
garden. She's going to wait a long while, so she's going to need a lot
of hope. Go to her. Tell her a story. Tell her that if she's patient,
the days are coming that she'll never forget. Tell her she'll go to sea
and fight pirates. She'll fall in love with a man who'll wait two
thousand years to keep her safe. Tell her she'll give hope to the
greatest painter who ever lived and save a whale in outer space. Tell
her this is the story of Amelia Pond. And this how it ends.<br>

this right, you're reading this letter a week after we left in the
Tardis. Er, the thing is, we're not coming back. We're alive and well,
and stuck in New York, fifty years before I was born. We can't come
home again. I won't ever see you again, and that breaks my heart. I'm
so sorry, Dad. I thought about this for years, and I realised there was
one thing I could do. I could write to you. Tell you everything about
how we lived. How despite it all, we were happy. But before I do, I
need you to know, you are the best dad any son could've had, and for
all of the times I've drove you mad, and you drove me mad, all the
times I snapped at you, I'm sorry. I miss everything about you.
