out.) <br>
ROSE: How long have I been gone? <br>
DOCTOR: About twelve hours. <br>
ROSE: Oh. Right, I won't be long. I just want to see my mum. <br>
DOCTOR: What're you going to tell her? <br>
ROSE: I don't know. I've been to the year 5 billion and only been gone,
what, twelve hours? No, I'll just tell her I spent the night at
Shareen's. See you later. Oh, don't you disappear. <br>

poster half stuck to a concrete pillar. Police Appeal for Assistance.
Can You Help?)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ROSE: I'm back! I was with Shareen. She was all
upset again. Are you in? So, what's been going on? How've you been?
What? What's that face for? It's not the first time I've stayed out all
night. <br>
(Jackie drops her mug of tea. It smashes on the floor. The Doctor
finishes reading the poster and runs to the flat. The poster says -
Rose Tyler has been missing from her home on the Powell Estate since
6th March 2005.) <br>
JACKIE: It's you. <br>
ROSE: Of course it's me. <br>
JACKIE: Oh, my God. It's you. Oh my God.
(Jackie hugs Rose, who spots several different types of missing person
posters on the table. The Doctor runs in.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not twelve hours, it's twelve months. You've been gone a
whole year. Sorry. <br>
(Outside, a young boy has spray-painted Bad Wolf on the side of the
Tardis. Inside, astonishment has given way to fury, and a policeman has
been called.) <br>
JACKIE: The hours I've sat here, days and weeks and months, all on my
own. I thought you were dead, and where were you? Travelling. What the
hell does that mean, travelling? That's no sort of answer. You ask her.
She won't tell me. That's all she says. Travelling. <br>
ROSE: That's what I was doing. <br>
JACKIE: When your passport's still in the drawer? It's just one lie
after another. <br>
ROSE: I meant to phone. I really did. I just I forgot. <br>
JACKIE: What, for a year? You forgot for a year? And I am left sitting
here. I just don't believe you. Why won't you tell me where you've
been? <br>
DOCTOR: Actually, it's my fault. I sort of er, employed Rose as my
companion. <br>
POLICEMAN: When you say companion, is this a sexual relationship? <br>
ROSE + DOCTOR: No. <br>
JACKIE: Then what is it? Because you, you waltz in here all charm and
smiles, and the next thing I know, she vanishes off the face of the
Earth! How old are you then? Forty? Forty five? What, did you find her
on the Internet? Did you go online and pretend you're a doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I am a Doctor. <br>
JACKIE: Prove it. Stitch this, mate! <br>
(Jackie hits the Doctor, hard. Later, in the kitchen, mother and
daughter are reconciled.) <br>
JACKIE: Did you think about me at all? <br>
ROSE: I did. All the time, but <br>
JACKIE: One phone call. Just to know that you were alive. <br>
ROSE: I'm sorry. I really am. <br>
JACKIE: Do you know, what terrifies me is that you still can't say.
What happened to you, Rose? What can be so bad that you can't tell me,
sweetheart? Where were you?

ROSE: I can't tell her. I can't even begin. She's never going to
forgive me. And I missed a year. Was it good? <br>
DOCTOR: Middling. <br>
ROSE: You're so useless. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if it's this much trouble, are you going to stay here
now? <br>
ROSE: I don't know. I can't do that to her again, though. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, she's not coming with us. <br>
ROSE: No chance. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't do families. <br>
ROSE: She slapped you! <br>
DOCTOR: Nine hundred years of time and space, and I've never been
slapped by someone's mother. <br>
ROSE: Your face. <br>
DOCTOR: It hurt! <br>
ROSE: You're so gay. When you say nine hundred years? <br>
DOCTOR: That's my age. <br>
ROSE: You're nine hundred years old. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
ROSE: My mum was right. That is one hell of an age gap. Every
conversation with you just goes mental. There's no one else I can talk
to. I've seen all that stuff up there, the size of it, and I can't say
a word. Aliens and spaceships and things, and I'm the only person on
planet Earth who knows they exist. <br>
(There is a deep horn and a spaceship, trailing black smoke passes
overhead and heads for the city. It misses Tower Bridge, weaves around
St
Paul's, then with a nasty back-fire and a splutter, dives for the
Thames, taking out the Clock Tower at what at first glance looks like
9:58 except the dial is actually backwards, silly special effects
people. Big Ben chimes once and the spaceship crashes into the river.
The Doctor and Rose watch a plume of black smoke rise into the air on
the horizon.) <br>

MAN: Just my luck. <br>
SOLDIER: Get back. Get back. <br>
DOCTOR: It's blocked off. <br>
ROSE: We're miles from the centre. The city must be grid locked. The
whole of London must be closing down. <br>
DOCTOR: I know. I can't believe I'm here to see this. This is
fantastic! <br>
ROSE: Did you know this was going to happen? <br>
DOCTOR: Nope. <br>
ROSE: Do you recognise the ship? <br>
DOCTOR: Nope. <br>
ROSE: Do you know why it crashed? <br>
DOCTOR: Nope. <br>
ROSE: Oh, I'm so glad I've got you. <br>
DOCTOR: I bet you are. This is what I travel for, Rose. To see history
happening right in front of us. <br>
ROSE: Well, let's go and see it. Never mind the traffic, we've got the
Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Better not. They've already got one spaceship in the middle of
London. I don't want to shove another one on top. <br>
ROSE: Yeah, but yours looks like a big blue box. No one's going to
notice. <br>
DOCTOR: You'd be surprised. Emergency like this, there'll be all kinds
of people watching. Trust me. The Tardis stays where it is. <br>
ROSE: So history's happening and we're stuck here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. <br>
MAN: It's got to be Ken Livingstone, hasn't it.&nbsp;<br>
ROSE: We could always do what everybody else does. We could watch it on
TV.

by taking the skull of a cat, gluing it to a fish and calling it a
mermaid. Now someone's taken a pig, opened up it's brain, stuck bits
on, then they've strapped it in that ship and made it dive bomb. It
must've been terrified. They've taken this animal and turned it into a

DOCTOR: That's the spaceship on its way to Earth, see? Except. Hold on.
See? The spaceship did a sling shot round the Earth before it landed. <br>
ROSE: What does that mean? <br>
