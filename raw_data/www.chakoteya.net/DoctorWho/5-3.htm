</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It is a land of glaciers, crevasses and massive
icicles. In the hi-tech control room, workers in plastic tunics and
knee-high boots rush around turning dials on the four curved control
panels surrounding a circular central computer interface.) <br>
ANNOUNCER [OC]: This is a preliminary warning. Preliminary warning.
Prepare phase one base evacuation procedure. Phase one evacuation. <br>
(Clent enters, leaning on a walking stick in his right hand. Say Hi to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055134/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Peter
Barkworth</a>, everyone.) <br>
CLENT: Why has the ioniser been allowed to deteriorate to danger level?
<br>
GARRETT: (woman) There was a power stoppage. I've done all I can to
boost it. <br>
CLENT: Well, it can't be allowed to fall any lower. <br>
GARRETT: We still have time to evacuate. <br>
CLENT: We will certainly not evacuate. We've beaten its tantrums
before. <br>
GARRETT: It's falling again. <br>
CLENT: Well, hold it! You must hold it steady. <br>
GARRETT: I can't. <br>
CLENT: Switch the stabilising circuits through to computer control. <br>
GARRETT: I have. It's still not holding! <br>
CLENT: All circuits, woman. All circuits! <br>
GARRETT: We're nearly there. <br>
CLENT: There's not enough power. <br>
GARRETT: It's slowing down. <br>
CLENT: Maybe it'll hold there. <br>
GARRETT: I doubt it. <br>
CLENT: Well, at least it gives us time. <br>
GARRETT: We need Scientist Penley. <br>
CLENT: He is no longer a member of this post. You will make this
machine work. <br>
GARRETT: Yes, Leader Clent. <br>
CLENT: That's better. <br>
GARRETT: Emergency evacuation phasing set. <br>
WOMAN: Yes. <br>
GARRETT: Ioniser state fault check. <br>
WOMAN 2: Yes. <br>
GARRETT: Reactor safety sequence in operation. Good. <br>
CLENT: You'll make an Organiser First Class yet, Miss Garrett. <br>
GARRETT: I only follow your example, Leader Clent. <br>
(Clent sits at the central unit.) <br>
CLENT: What is the latest report from all other ioniser bases? <br>
COMPUTER: All bases are in phase. America, glaciers held. Australasia,
glaciers held. South Africa, glaciers held. Asia, some improvement
claimed. <br>
CLENT: They would. <br>
COMPUTER: Britannicus Base Europe, slipping out of phase. Glacial
advance imminent. <br>
GARRETT: If we fail, the whole programme for glacier containment is in
danger. <br>
CLENT: I'm fully aware of that fact. <br>
GARRETT: But in two hours the ioniser will be useless. <br>
CLENT: And then the glaciers will move again. Five thousand years of
history crushed beneath a moving mountain of ice. <br>
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Phase two evacuation. Emergency. Phase two evacuation.
Red state emergency. Red state emergency. <br>
CLENT: Priority override. <br>
GARRETT: Yes, of course. But Penley was the expert. <br>
CLENT: I've had enough of experts and their crazy ideas. Where's Arden?
<br>
GARRETT: Still at the ice face, completing the instrumentation project.
<br>
CLENT: Well, hasn't he been warned? <br>
GARRETT: We couldn't get through. Surface communication's impossible
when <br>
CLENT: Well, we have to tell him immediately. I cannot lose any more
men. Leader Clent to Scientist Arden at glacier face. Come in, Arden.

with metal helmets and goggles too. Very appropriate for arctic
conditions I don't think.) <br>
ARDEN: Walters, drill here. Now clear that trench, Walters, while I
prepare the seismograph probe. <br>
WALTERS: Sir. Get your drill ready, Davis. Sir! <br>
ARDEN: Yes? <br>
WALTERS: Come quickly, sir! <br>
(Walters rubs snow off a wall of clear ice.) <br>
WALTERS: I could swear there's something inside. <br>
ARDEN: Oh, not another mastodon. <br>
WALTERS: Well, look for yourself, sir. <br>
ARDEN: Is it a man? <br>
WALTERS: Perhaps it's an animal. <br>
ARDEN: Well, we'll soon find out. Davis, the heavy drill. <br>
DAVIS: Yes, sir. <br>
(Walter's wrist-com beeps.) <br>
WALTERS: Base calling, Sir. <br>
ARDEN: What do they want? <br>
WALTERS: There's nothing coming through. Poor reception. I suppose they
<br>
ARDEN: They'll have to wait. This is more important. Come on, Davis. <br>
WALTERS: Well, what are we going to do, sir? <br>
ARDEN: Do? Excavate. This could be a brilliant discovery. <br>
WALTERS: But, sir, the computerised schedule. We must stick to that. <br>
ARDEN: Oh, must we? <br>
WALTERS: Leader Clent will be furious, sir. <br>
ARDEN: Well, that's just too bad. For once we'll do something on our
own account, eh? <br>
WALTERS: There's not much base can do about it, sir. After all, we
can't even ask permission, can we? <br>
ARDEN: Come on, Davis. Hurry, man! <br>
(ARDEN wipes away more of the snow)

is urgent! <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Snow piles up against the modular base walls, and
the remains of dead trees stick out of it. The Tardis materialises on
its side on a pile of snow, then slides down with the roof pointing to
the ground. There are screams and squeals from inside. Someone pushes
at the doors.) <br>
JAMIE [OC]: Up you go. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: Just got to get my hand there. <br>
JAMIE [OC]: You can. Now the other one. <br>
(The Doctor emerges, wearing his fur coat.) <br>
JAMIE [OC]: Argh! <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter? <br>
JAMIE [OC]: You're on my head! <br>
(The Doctor falls back inside. Victoria squeals. The Doctor clambers
out again.) <br>
JAMIE [OC]: Careful. <br>
DOCTOR: Up you come. There we are. Come on, Victoria. Give me your
hand. <br>
(All three are leaning on the Tardis 'doorstep'. Victoria has put a
fur-trimmed velvet cape over her tweed jacket.) <br>
DOCTOR: It was a blind landing. <br>
JAMIE: Is that what you call it? <br>
VICTORIA: Well, no broken bones. Hey, look at the snow. <br>
JAMIE: Oh no, not again. Tibet was bad enough, but I think you've put
us down just further up the mountain. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's see, shall we? Very careful. I'm going to get out.
It's quite a long drop. <br>
JAMIE: Up you go. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, Victoria. That's right. <br>
VICTORIA: Hey, it looks like a great big wall of ice. <br>
(The Doctor's eyes pop out of his head.) <br>
JAMIE: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: You're on my hand! <br>
VICTORIA: But Doctor, look. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's not ice, that's plastic. <br>
JAMIE: Yes, and see how smooth it is, and curved. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It's a dome. A protective dome. <br>
(Jamie shuts the Tardis doors.) <br>
VICTORIA: It's so big. Can't see the end of it. Wonder what's inside. <br>
(A door in the dome opens and a scruffy man in furs comes out. The
travellers duck down behind the Tardis. A second scruff comes out
carrying boxes.) <br>
PENLEY: Don't worry. Those alarms weren't meant for us. I wonder what's
wrong, though. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0758608/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Peter
Sallis</a>.) <br>
STORR: (Scots) Aye, that's their problem. Come on. <br>
(The two men leave and the travellers go to the now-shut door. A wolf
howls nearby. The Doctor waves his hand in front of a panel and the
door opens. On the opposite wall is a picture of a street with
colonnaded shops. They go in and the door closes behind them.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GARRETT: Leader Clent, the video! Arden has made
contact. <br>
CLENT: Arden, can you hear me? <br>
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes. What is it? <br>
CLENT: You must return to base immediately. <br>
ARDEN [on monitor]: Well, don't panic. I've almost finished setting up
the seismograph probes. Davis, hurry up. <br>
CLENT: Yes, but the ioniser's nearly at disintegration point. <br>
ARDEN [on monitor]: Oh, I wonder if Penley's ears are burning. <br>
CLENT: It's not a laughing matter, man! You know what it means. <br>
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes. Cold weather ahead. I thought it felt a bit
nippy. <br>
CLENT: There'll be a full enquiry into your delay, you realise that. <br>
ARDEN [on monitor]: Yes, and I've got a very good reason. A fantastic
discovery in the ice. <br>
CLENT: Your task was to set up movement probes in the ice, not indulge
in amateur archaeology. <br>
ARDEN [on monitor]: This is a man! <br>
CLENT: Oh, congratulations. Makes a change from fossils. Now leave it
and return. <br>
ARDEN [on monitor]: I'm bringing the body back with me. <br>
CLENT: Arden. <br>
ARDEN [on monitor]: I'm sorry, I can't hear you. There seems to some

DOCTOR: We're discovered. <br>
(She pins labels on the travellers.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. <br>
JAMIE: Thank you. Excuse me, miss, I'm Jamie McCrimmon, do you think
you could tell us where we are? <br>
(The woman walks away.) <br>
DOCTOR: She doesn't want to know, Jamie. <br>
VICTORIA: Hey, this says we're on evacuation flight seven. <br>
DOCTOR: Rather inhospitable. We've only just arrived. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, and this tag, it says I'm a scavenger. And yours does too!
Here, we're not beggars. <br>
DOCTOR: Hush, Jamie. <br>
VICTORIA: What is it Doctor? <br>
(The Doctor listens at a door.) <br>
DOCTOR: It sounds like electronic machinery. Like a computer. There's
something wrong with it's pitch. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, no. Now look, it might be dangerous. Now let's leave it. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, there's something very wrong here. <br>
CLENT: Now is (something) still out of phase? Seven two point four. <br>
DOCTOR: Seven two point four? That's bad. <br>
(The Doctor follows Clent around the control desks.) <br>
CLENT: Now balance those gauges, Miss Henry. 17 degrees out of norm. <br>
DOCTOR: 17 degrees? Well, this is serious! <br>
CLENT: Miss (something), report to me <br>
GARRETT: level will you? Minus one seven degrees. <br>
CLENT: One three seven-nine. <br>
DOCTOR: One three seven nine? Excuse me, I <br>
CLENT: Who the blazes are you? Get these scavengers out of here, quick!
<br>
DOCTOR: No! We're not scavengers! <br>
(General shouting as security try to grab the Doctor's coat.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! In two minutes thirty eight seconds, you're going to have
an almighty explosion! The readings say so! <br>
CLENT: Well how can you possibly know that? I haven't even, I haven't
even processed them through the computer yet! <br>
DOCTOR: I don't need a computer. <br>
GARRETT: If he's right it's already too late to escape. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It doesn't have to happen. If you'll excuse me. <br>
(The Doctor runs round the control desks, giving instructions.) <br>
DOCTOR: Cut out the reactor link for a start! Uncouple the transformer
unit. (something) the density phase and power. <br>
GARRETT: There's insufficient power for that. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a quick short burst then from the reactor unit, now. Off!
Now link the circuits with the reactor link. Now, bring in the computer
stabiliser. Yes, that should hold it steady. It's not a perfect job,
mind you. You ought to get an expert in, you know. <br>
CLENT: How did you? It was all a bluff, wasn't it, that two minutes
thirty eight seconds to danger. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, it was near enough correct. Give or take a second. <br>
CLENT: Rubbish. <br>
DOCTOR: Check it on your precious computer then. <br>
CLENT: Miss Garrett, do so. <br>
(Garrett reads Clent's notes to the central terminal.) <br>
GARRETT: Ioniser fall rate, seven two point four. Ion compensator,
minus one seven degrees. Ion flow rate, one three seven nine.
Assessment please. <br>
COMPUTER: Immediate emergency. In two minutes thirty seven seconds, the
reactor will explode. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, a second out. We can't all be perfect. <br>
GARRETT: We're at half power now, Leader Clent. <br>
CLENT: Why, even Penley couldn't have done better. Where on earth did
you spring from? It doesn't matter. Now look <br>
(Clent wobbles and puts his hand to his head.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter? <br>
GARRETT: Are you all right? <br>
CLENT: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, no, it's nothing. It's just an
emergency added to a ten hour duty spell. <br>
GARRETT: The vibro-chair. <br>
CLENT: Yes, you're right. Contact the Medi-Control centre the moment
there's a further downward fluctuation. We'll talk at the same time,
come with me. (he leaves the room) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, Jamie, (something) <br>
JAMIE: Ask him where we are.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(There's a sort of humanoid inside the ice,
towering above the men.) <br>
ARDEN: A giant among prehistoric men. <br>
WALTERS: See the kind of armour he's got on? <br>
ARDEN: Yes, that's rather strange. He looks pre-Viking. But no such
civilisation existed in pre-historic times, before the first ice age. <br>
WALTERS: Proper Ice Warrior, isn't he, sir? I reckon Leader Clent'll be
interested. <br>
ARDEN: Yes. What'll the mighty computer make of it, ay? <br>
WALTERS: Sir, hadn't we better get back while the weather still holds? <br>
ARDEN: Good point, Walters. Davis, try bringing the air-sled a little
closer, will you? <br>
(Davis walks out into the storm, watched by Storr and Penley,
sheltering in another finger of the glacier face.) <br>
STORR: What are they up to? <br>
PENLEY: Arden's found something in the ice. Something to take back to
Clent. It won't be appreciated. <br>
STORR: Aye, they ought to leave way alone. <br>
PENLEY: Arden was always a researcher. He wanted to be an archaeologist
when I knew him. <br>
STORR: Archaeology. What good's that? <br>
PENLEY: It's good to know things, even when they're dead. <br>
STORR: Nothing's sacred to you, is it? <br>
PENLEY: I only ask questions. It's in my character, I suppose. <br>
STORR: Aye, you swore you'd give all that up. <br>
PENLEY: Discovery is as exciting to me as the hunt is to you. But with
Clent, he uses scientists craniums as stepping stones for his
ambitions. <br>
STORR: Aye, that's about all you lot are fit for. Door steps. <br>
PENLEY: Well we're not totally useless, surely? <br>
STORR: To me you are. Come one, we've got to move. Leave them to their
stupid games. <br>
(Penley and Storr walk out into the storm, then take cover as Davies is
coming back. He looks up as a wall of snow falls off the ice face above
him.) <br>
WALTERS: Avalanche! Come on! <br>
PENLEY: Look out! Avalanche! <br>
(Davis is swept off his feet and down into a crevasse in front of the
glacier face.)
PENLEY: Storr, are you alright? <br>
STORR: Penley. <br>
PENLEY: What's the damage? <br>
STORR: My arm. It's gone, I think. <br>
PENLEY: Broken? <br>
STORR: Feels like it. <br>
PENLEY: Well, you're lucky. There's one down there who's staying on the
mountain for good. <br>
STORR: They'll come looking for him. We must move out a bit. Unless you
fancy trying to turn me over to your friends. <br>
PENLEY: Six weeks ago they were my friends, but not any more. Can you
walk? <br>
STORR: Aye. Just you try and keep up. Come on. <br>
WALTERS: All clear, sir. <br>
ARDEN: Yes, but how about Davis? <br>
WALTERS: I'll go look for him. <br>
ARDEN: Well, let's hope he's safe. With another man gone, Clent'll skin
me alive. <br>

warrior on him, hey, sir? </font></p>

equipment scattered around and bookshelves line the walls.) <br>
CLENT: But you've no valid proof of your qualifications? <br>
DOCTOR: Look, aren't we wasting time? If you want our help, why not
tell us all about it? <br>
CLENT: All about it? All about what? Where have you been all these
years? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, as a matter of fact, we've been in retreat. In Tibet. We
are sanctifiers. <br>
CLENT: Oh, I see. In Tibet. Well, if you'll take a simple test, I'll
soon know if you're up to our scientific standards. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And if I fail? <br>
CLENT: You'll be evacuated with the other scavengers in due course. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, where to? <br>
GARRETT: The African rehabilitation centres, of course. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, no, not Africa. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well, fire away. <br>
CLENT: I present you a problem. All the major continents are threatened
with destruction under the glaciers of the second ice age. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
CLENT: How would you halt the ice surge and turn the climate back to
normal? Forty five seconds starting from now. <br>
(Garrett starts the countdown.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, possible causes. The reversal of the magnetic field. <br>
CLENT: No such change has occurred. <br>
DOCTOR: Interstellar clouds obscuring the suns rays? An excessive burst
of sunspot activity. A severe shift of the Earth's angle of rotation. <br>
VICTORIA: Come on, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: There aren't that many alternatives. Gigantic heat loss? <br>
CLENT: I asked for an answer, not a question. Twelve seconds left. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, in that case the answer's simple. A severe drop
in the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's lower atmosphere. Is that
it? <br>
I would use ionisation. <br>
(The timer goes ding!) <br>
JAMIE: Well, is he right? <br>
(Clent stands up.) <br>
CLENT: Yes, he is. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh. But I still don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere helps
retain the sun's heat. Take that gas away, and there's a sudden freeze
up. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, where does the gas go to? <br>
DOCTOR: Well <br>
CLENT: You know how efficient our civilisation is, thanks to the
direction of the great World Computer. And you also know how we
conquered the problem of world famine a century ago by artificial
foods. <br>
(Clent gets himself one of these from a dispenser.) <br>
CLENT: On the land that was once used to grow the food we needed, we
built up to date living units, to house the ever-increasing population.
<br>
DOCTOR: Up to date? <br>
CLENT: Well, there were exceptions, of course. I mean, this house was
classified as being of historic interest. So, the amount of growing
plants on the planet, was reduced to an absolute minimum. <br>
DOCTOR: No plants, no carbon dioxide. <br>
CLENT: Then suddenly, one year, there was no spring. Even then it
wasn't understood. Not until the ice-caps began to advance. <br>
JAMIE: But, what's this ioniser? <br>
CLENT: Miss Garrett. <br>
GARRETT: Ionisation is a method of intensifying the sun's heat onto the
Earth, but into particular areas. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's like a magnifying glass, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, aye. <br>
VICTORIA: You mean you can melt glaciers and change the weather? <br>
CLENT: When certain difficulties are overcome. <br>
GARRETT: Precise control is not easy. <br>
CLENT: We can't afford to make mistakes. Ionisation can produce
temperatures intense enough to melt rock. <br>
GARRETT: Only by maintaining a perfect balance can we prevent
widespread flooding. <br>
DOCTOR: Can't your computers solve the problem of control? <br>
GARRETT: Of course they can. <br>
DOCTOR: Well. <br>
GARRETT: When the imprint data is complete they will give us the
solution. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. And when will that be? <br>
GARRETT: Soon, Doctor, soon. <br>
DOCTOR: What's the position now? <br>
CLENT: Well, we're barely holding the glacier in check. Now, there you
see a world map of the situation at the moment. And there you see
what's going on in our sector. But if we fail, then not only will
Europe be swallowed up, but the balance of power will be ruined, and
the whole world programme will go under. <br>
DOCTOR: And the glaciers will win. I see. <br>
CLENT: My senior scientist, Penley, is missing. I think you have the
capabilities to join us here in this great mission. Will you help us? <br>
DOCTOR: Well I'm willing to try. <br>
CLENT: Jolly good. Jolly good. Miss Garrett will give you some
background information. You've worked with computers, I presume? <br>
DOCTOR: Only when I have to. <br>
GARRETT: Well, Miss Garrett is our computer specialist. She'll help
you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I'll try and remember that. <br>
GARRETT: Here we are completely computerised. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, never mind. <br>
GARRETT: Every decision is checked to eliminate risk of failure.
Because of course, all decisions, all actions, must conform to the

(Clent, Garrett and Arden leave.) <br>
JAMIE: Well, what's supposed to happen, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: You see, this fellow Arden has set the electricity so that the
ice melts very slowly, allowing for the resistance. <br>
VICTORIA: It's working quite quickly. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I suspect there are some impurities in the ice. I say.
Look at that. <br>
JAMIE: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: It's an electronic connection. I'm sure of it. <br>
VICTORIA: It can't be. <br>
DOCTOR: Now you wait here, and don't touch anything. <br>

blocking the ice off from the rest of the room.) <br>

VICTORIA: I don't know. Scientists are all alike. Eureka and all that. <br>
JAMIE: Aye. He could do with a go on this, maybe. <br>
(Jamie lies on the vibro-chair. Behind the curtain, chunks of ice are
quickly falling off a very non-human figure with no fingers on its
hands.) <br>
JAMIE: Victoria? <br>
VICTORIA: What? <br>
JAMIE: You see how those lassies were dressed? <br>
VICTORIA: Yes, I did. And trust you to think of something like that. <br>
JAMIE: Well, I couldn't help thinking about it. <br>

DOCTOR: This headpiece is no warriors tin-hat. It's a highly

CLENT: Aren't you jumping to conclusions, Doctor, for a scientist? <br>
ARDEN: But if this is true? <br>
DOCTOR: If this is true your project is in danger. <br>
CLENT: In what way? How can one preserved body, however old, effect us?
<br>
DOCTOR: How did he get here? Well, he didn't walk, did he? <br>
CLENT: Well, if what you say is true, by spaceship. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and where is that spaceship now? <br>
ARDEN: In the glacier. Then it must still be intact. He had no signs of
mutilation. He couldn't have crashed. He must of landed. Clent, can't
you see the importance of such a discovery? <br>
CLENT: The propulsion unit of the spacecraft is probably <br>
GARRETT: Probably atomic powered. <br>
CLENT: Quite. And, er, if we use the ioniser at full power <br>
DOCTOR: This reactor pile could be exploded or be activated. <br>
CLENT: But if we don't <br>
GARRETT: The whole area will be contaminated. <br>
CLENT: But if we don't use the ioniser, what then? We are part of a

if we hold back that plan cannot go into operation. <br>
GARRETT: We could hold it at minimal power. <br>
CLENT: Not good enough. <br>
ARDEN: No, we daren't take the risk. The contamination level would last
for five decades or more. <br>
CLENT: It merely makes the fine control of the heat level even more
vital. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I thought you ought to know. <br>
CLENT: Yes, you were right, thank you. I must inform the computer

tread carefully. <br>

ARDEN: Now listen, Clent, we both know that I'm responsible for what
has happened. If I hadn't brought that creature back here in the first
place, none of this would have occurred. I also caused the death of
Davis. I can't forget that, either. <br>
CLENT: Well, you just remember your mission, that's all. And no wild
sorties after the girl. It's vital that you get your information back
to us immediately. <br>
JAMIE: Look, we'll not leave Victoria to the warriors, if that's what
you mean. If there's half a chance of us two <br>

ARDEN: Come along, boy. <br>
CLENT: Arden? <br>
ARDEN: Yes? <br>
CLENT: Don't be to too hard on yourself. Scientists must question, you
know. I mean, if I'd been in your shoes I think I'd have done the same.
I'd have, I'd have brought it back. So, anyway, good luck. <br>

CLENT: Miss Garrett? I like things done properly. Where is she? <br>
DOCTOR: Now Clent, just remember I am not a member of your staff. I'm
just a working guest, as you might say. <br>
CLENT: Yes, of course. But this is a formal establishment, and our
regulations <br>
DOCTOR: Your regulations do not apply to me. I work in my own way,
freely. <br>
CLENT: I see. Like Penley. Regulations seemed to bother him, too.
Probably caused his eventual breakdown, in fact. <br>
DOCTOR: Breakdown? I thought you said he defected? <br>

PENLEY: You're fit enough now. To do the cooking, at least. Thanks to

STORR: Science! Och, it wasn't science, it was just good plain

PENLEY: Yes, you're definitely back to your normal witty self. What's
the matter? <br>
STORR: Someone's outside. <br>
PENLEY: They must have tracked me here from the base. Hide yourself. We
don't want you carted off to Africa yet. You! <br>
GARRETT: I followed you. It's all right, I'm alone. <br>
PENLEY: What do you want? <br>
GARRETT: Elric, we're in desperate trouble at the base. You're the only

rose-tinted. <br>
GARRETT: He does need you to make the ioniser work again. <br>
PENLEY: Is that all? <br>

World Control. <br>
PENLEY: Oh well, now we're coming to it, aren't we? The great Clent
would have to admit failure. That's it, isn't it? Poor old Clent. He
never could face the music. Here, what about this creature at the
glacier? <br>
GARRETT: That's only part of our trouble. The real problem is the
ioniser. Will you come? <br>
PENLEY: It's typical of him to send you, instead of armed guards. <br>
GARRETT: He doesn't know I'm here. I'm asking you. <br>
PENLEY: I won't come. <br>
GARRETT: But you can't just step aside. A man like you, living like a
scavenger? It's utterly wrong. Civilisation needs you. <br>
PENLEY: Jane, I chose this existence. I chose it because I refuse to be
sucked into that computerised ant-heap you call a civilisation. I'm a
man, not a machine. I will not return. <br>
GARRETT: Not even to save the world? <br>
PENLEY: Save the world? Well, that has a fine Clentian ring to it. No
thanks, no. It'll take more than me to do that. But don't you worry,
you don't get rid of my sort all that easily. Machines corrode and
rust, but mankind goes on. You'll find Clent one of these days in a
museum, like that ancient stove, with an inscription round him.
Robotised human mark two, now extinct. But you'll find others like me
still alive. <br>
GARRETT: Surely, Elric, that's all the more reason to come back. To
change things. <br>
PENLEY: Don't you understand, Jane? Clent's just a talker. He's a glib
political animal. Even if I did change things, the Clent's of this
world would still come out on top. Running things according to their
own whims and indulgences. And the pity of it is, they believe they're
right. <br>
GARRETT: Then you leave me no alternative. You will come, and now! <br>
PENLEY: You must be desperate. But tranquillising me isn't going to
make it any easier. You'd never be able to carry me all that way. <br>
STORR: Oh no you don't! <br>
GARRETT: Who's this? <br>
PENLEY: Just a friend. Now what are you going to do? <br>
GARRETT: Return to base and wait for the inevitable disaster. <br>
STORR: Oh no, you don't. I'm not having you set the dogs on me. I'd as
soon put an end to her game. Give me that. <br>
PENLEY: Storr, no. She won't put us away. <br>
GARRETT: No, I won't. <br>
STORR: I don't trust any of them. <br>
GARRETT: Please trust me enough to come with me to safety. Apart from
the danger of the glacier, these creatures. <br>
PENLEY: Oh yes, your ice warriors. Well, we shall just have to take our
chance. No, I won't return. And now you must go. But if Sir Genius does
have trouble with the ioniser, look up my notes on the Omega factor. <br>
GARRETT: Thank you for that at least. <br>

GARRETT: That will? <br>
DOCTOR: I will. <br>
CLENT: With the help of ammonium sulphide? <br>

know about their planets atmospheric conditions? <br>
GARRETT: Chiefly nitrogen, with virtually no oxygen or hydrogen. <br>
DOCTOR: Then they're not going to enjoy this little concoction much,
are they? <br>
CLENT: What? You mean you intend to use it as a kind of toxic gas? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if I'm going to an alien spaceship it may come in handy. <br>

DOCTOR: Arden fell into a trap. I know what to expect. <br>
CLENT: I refuse to allow you to go! <br>
DOCTOR: Splendid! You go instead then! <br>
GARRETT: No one can be spared. Least of all Leader Clent. <br>
DOCTOR: I can be spared. I've done all I can here. The ioniser will
work without me. I'd start getting it ready if I were you. <br>
CLENT: But if anything goes wrong with the countdown? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you'll manage. <br>
CLENT: No. <br>
DOCTOR: It's as simple as this. Someone has to get to the spacecraft,
find out what sort of propulsion unit it has, and bring the information
back to you, or we can't use the ioniser. Now, who better than me? <br>
CLENT: I've come to regard you as Penley's replacement, and. All right,
all right. But it's strictly under protest. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
GARRETT: How will you get the information back to us? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. Now I don't suppose you have a small radio transmitter? <br>
CLENT: No, our video links are the only communicators available. Pure
sound is no longer in use. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, you won't see me, but you'll hear me. As soon as I
get to the glacier face I'll switch it on and you'll overhear. I hope. <br>
GARRETT: Is that all you're taking? <br>
DOCTOR: Why, what else do I need? <br>
CLENT; But the Warriors are armed. <br>
DOCTOR: But I'm not going to fight a duel. <br>
GARRETT: But you must be in a position to defend yourself. They'll try
to kill you out of hand. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. This is my defence. <br>
CLENT: But how can you rely on that? They've already proved themselves
to be utterly ruthless. <br>
DOCTOR: I think they'll listen to me. <br>
GARRETT: You mean you're going to let them take you prisoner? <br>
DOCTOR: That is exactly what I'm going to do.

VARGA: The gun is useless.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Victoria, see if you can find Jamie. <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor, Jamie's in there. He's alive! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh thank goodness for that. Now you get back to the Tardis, and
close the doors. <br>
(The Doctor waves the remains of the ammonium sulphate under Penley's
nose. It wakes him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry about that. Up you get. Come along. <br>
PENLEY: What happened? Did you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: No time for questions. Come along. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Spacecraft]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VARGA: So, you allowed them to trick you. <br>
ZONDAL: I await your punishment, Commander. <br>
VARGA: We have no time. Everything depends on being ready to break free
from the ice as soon as they evaporate it.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Ioniser control room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Up you get. Come along, Miss Garrett. There
you are. <br>
GARRETT: Oh, the ioniser. They made me disconnect it. <br>
DOCTOR: Then it must be switched on again immediately. <br>
GARRETT: I don't take orders from you. <br>
CLENT: Miss Garrett, if we are to obey Computer Control, it must be
reconnected. Do so, please. <br>
GARRETT: Yes, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: Clent, their spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor. <br>
CLENT: Well, that means we dare not use the ioniser at full force.
That's our last chance gone. <br>
PENLEY: Why, for heavens sake? <br>
CLENT: Because of the risk, man. You know what would happen. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course there's a risk, but it's a risk we must take. It's
the only way! <br>
PENLEY: Exactly. <br>
CLENT: The computer says no! <br>
PENLEY: The computer <br>
CLENT: Is our supreme advisor. <br>
PENLEY: And what sort of advice is that. Do nothing? <br>
GARRETT: We must obey! <br>
PENLEY: And be destroyed? Has the computer considered that? <br>
CLENT: The computer considers everything. <br>
DOCTOR: But that's why in this case you cannot rely on its judgement! <br>
GARRETT: We trust the computer. It is our strength and our guide. <br>
DOCTOR: Not this time. <br>
JAMIE: Well, why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Because Jamie, the computer is faced with an insoluble problem.
Either way it risks destroying itself and this it cannot do. It must
play safe. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, but if it does nothing that's just as bad. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll explain to you another time, Jamie. <br>
PENLEY: There's only one way out. <br>
CLENT: What? <br>
PENLEY: We must over-ride the computer. <br>
GARRETT: You can't do that! <br>
PENLEY: We must. This is a decision for a man to take, not a machine.
The computer isn't designed to take risks, but that is the essence of
man's progress. We must decide. <br>
CLENT: But if you do that you'll soon ruin the world plan. All the
ioniser bases must act together through World Computer Control! If we
act too soon it's as bad as being too late! <br>
PENLEY: Yes, I know that, but the other bases haven't got a glacier
right on top of them and apart from that what about these ice warriors?
If they live they threaten our entire civilisation. <br>
DOCTOR: A decision must be taken, and quickly! <br>
CLENT: I can't. <br>
GARRETT: I daren't. <br>
DOCTOR: Penley, it's up to you. <br>
PENLEY: Well, Clent? <br>
CLENT: I reserve the right to consult the computer. <br>
PENLEY: Go ahead. <br>
CLENT: Problem. Alien spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor. Dare we
use the ioniser? What are the alternatives? Answer. <br>
(The computer spins and gibbers.) <br>
JAMIE: It's as though it's gone mad! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Penley? <br>
PENLEY: We will use the ioniser at full strength to turn back the
glacier. Miss Garrett, inform World Control. <br>
JAMIE: But the spaceship, if you release it from the ice? <br>
PENLEY: At full strength the ioniser will melt rock.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ZONDAL: Commander, the glacier is breaking up. Soon
we will be free. <br>
VARGA: What use is our freedom if we are helpless? Our engines must
still dead. <br>
ZONDAL: I have not given up yet. <br>
VARGA: Nor I. There must be some life left in the elements. <br>
ZONDAL: Commander, power. <br>
VARGA: What? The ice is our friend. We still have power. <br>
ZONDAL: Shall I increase it? <br>
VARGA: Carefully. We must time full take-off boost perfectly. <br>
ZONDAL: And when we are free and in flight, we will be invincible.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLENT: Instrument readings on the glacier face show
a steady rise in temperature. Now near to maximum. <br>
JAMIE: Well, do will we know? <br>
GARRETT: The instruments on the ice face have the highest heat and
shock resistance known to man. When they cease to function, everything
about them will be destroyed. <br>
CLENT: You're wrong! You're wrong! We'll all be killed! <br>
PENLEY: It is a risk I willingly take. <br>
(Penley slides the control down past generator, circuit lock, energy
feed to activator)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The spacecraft is full of smoke.) <br>
VARGA: It was not power in the engines, Zondal, it was heat. Heat from
the ioniser. <br>
(The instruments burst into flames.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The seismograph shows a small blip.) <br>
GARRETT: Only a minor explosion. We're safe! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Goodness me! <br>
PENLEY: Set all circuits to automatic, Miss Garrett, and tie in with
the World Ioniser instrumentation. Clent, will you check these readings
with me? And you've a report to prepare, haven't you? <br>
CLENT: Yes, yes, yes, I have. Penley, you are the most insufferably
irritating and infuriating person I've ever been
privileged to work with. <br>
PENLEY: Thank you. <br>
CLENT: Can't write a report though, can you? Something I've got to do
for you. Well don't worry, it's something that I've been trained to do.
<br>
PENLEY: Without the computer? <br>
CLENT: Now, Penley, I've always written my own speeches and my own
reports. <br>
PENLEY: Are you going to include? Well, where's the Doctor? <br>
