del Fuego on Lanzarote, two men trudge over the volcanic rocks. The
younger one stops, exhausted.) <br>
AMYAND: Come on, Roskal. <br>
ROSKAL: It's no good, I can't make it. <br>
AMYAND: Give me your hand. <br>
ROSKAL: No. Amyand, I'm afraid. <br>
AMYAND: So am I. We've come this far. We can't turn back now. Come on,
just a short climb then we can see into the heart of the mountain. The
others are depending on us. </font></p>

halls of the Mirador del Rio. Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943936/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Peter Wyngarde</a> in
flowing robes very suitable to the climate.) <br>
TIMANOV: Since my father's time, unbelievers have been sent to the
flames. <br>
MALKON: That was barbaric. <br>
TIMANOV: Yes, a little overzealous, perhaps. In those days, people
didn't tolerate dissenters as they do now. <br>
MALKON: But the unbelievers are harmless. <br>
TIMANOV: Yes, but it's still a wise precaution to send the occasional
free-thinker to the flames. Encourages faith in our traditions. <br>
MALKON: I could never order a burning. <br>
TIMANOV: When the time comes, you will be given the strength. It can be
a rewarding experience for those consumed in the flames. Unbelievers
are such, such unhappy souls. <br>
MALKON: Is it not sometimes good to doubt, Timanov? <br>
TIMANOV: Malkon, for our people to survive we must have faith, and
never more so than at this moment. Logar is testing us. We must not
seem to be wanting. </font></p>

loose slope of the volcano.) <br>
ROSKAL: I can't breathe. My feet are burning. <br>
AMYAND: Timanov says Logar is benevolent. Perhaps he's waiting with a
cool drink and new shoes. <br>
ROSKAL: How can you joke? <br>
AMYAND: Keep going. It's now or never, Roskal. <br>
(They reach the edge of the caldera and look down into a gash with
steam rising from it.) <br>
AMYAND: There's nothing there! <br>
ROSKAL: Not even a machine. <br>
AMYAND: Logar's a myth. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In the waters off Papagayo Beach, two men are
hauling up a basket of encrusted antiquities that have been found by a
sub-aqua diver.) <br>
CURT: Be careful. Do you wish to achieve what the sea could not? These
items are fragile. <br>
(One item has no encrustation on it. Like a dumbbell, but with one end
larger than the other, and with a pair of intersecting triangles as a
design on the end. He picks it up and shows it to a younger man.) <br>
CURT: Howard? <br>
FOSTER: Sure isn't Greek. <br>
CURT: Neither is it Roman. <br>
FOSTER: You're right. The metal's modern. Must be some kind of alloy.
Do you recognise the logo? <br>
CURT: No. <br>
FOSTER: I'll get one of the crew to take it to the police. <br>
CURT: Yes, but first we must get the statue safely ashore. I won't be
happy until it's safely in the workshop at the museum. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Settlement balcony]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TIMANOV: Only Logar could create a place of such
beauty. <br>
MALKON: Then why is he now trying to destroy the planet? <br>
TIMANOV: The ways of the gods are complex. Why with his own hands did
he build such a place? For his Chosen One. <br>
MALKON: I don't know. <br>
TIMANOV: Same with the Day of Fire. But why does he test us in this
way? <br>
MALKON: I only wish I had your faith. <br>
TIMANOV: Accept. Accept what you see and hear and feel all around you,
and the faith will come. <br>
MALKON: Perhaps. But I don't think I will ever understand why this
makes me special. <br>
(Malkon rolls up his sleeve to reveal a marking on his arm like the one
on the artefact on Earth.) <br>
TIMANOV: The sign of Logar. You are the Chosen One. The people of Sarn
expect your leadership. <br>
MALKON: But why? Why the importance of this mark? <br>
TIMANOV: Tradition! You were found on the slopes of the volcano. But
you know all this. How many times must I tell you? <br>
MALKON: I know only that I am confused. What of the memories and
strange dreams that I have? <br>
TIMANOV: I keep forgetting how very young you still are. Come, we must
hurry. One day, it'll all be clear to you. <br>

man with a telescope on a tripod.) </font></p>

TURLOUGH: Doctor, you're becoming obsessed. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, obsessed and depressed. <br>
TURLOUGH: You miss Tegan? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we were together a long time. <br>

on the floor surrounded by an aura. He is plugged into a mechanism
behind a roundel.) <br>
KAMELION: Help me! Pain. <br>
TURLOUGH: He's connected to the Tardis databank. <br>
(Turlough moves to unplug Kamelion.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. No, we need to stop the spasming. Go and programme
an alpha rhythm on the computer. It should calm him. <br>
KAMELION: Help me, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, Kamelion. Help's on its way. <br>
(Turlough programmes the console as instructed.) <br>
KAMELION: Point of contact. Point of contact will be made. Contact me. <br>

distress signal stops. The Doctor enters.) <br>
TURLOUGH: How's Kamelion? <br>
DOCTOR: The spasming's stopped and he's fully conscious. I just wish I <br>
(The Doctor discovers Turlough's sabotage.) <br>
DOCTOR: What have you done? <br>
TURLOUGH: We were picking up some sort of random emission, and I, I
thought it might be interfering with Kamelion. <br>
DOCTOR: And why have you reset the coordinates? <br>
TURLOUGH: I haven't. <br>
DOCTOR: Someone has. <br>
TURLOUGH: Kamelion's plugged into the computer. He must have
computerised the signals we heard. </font></p>

PERI: Hi. <br>
FOSTER: What are you doing here? I thought you were going sight-seeing
with your mother. <br>
PERI: No, she's taken up with that Mrs van Geysingham from the hotel,
and I'm not spending all afternoon exploring a Cro-Magnon cave with
some octogenarian from Miami Beach. Hey, what's this? Looks like Elton
John. <br>
(The statue is carried past.) <br>
FOSTER: It's Eros, if you really want to know. <br>
PERI: The god of love and fertility. <br>
FOSTER: That's right. Beautiful, isn't he? A personification of natural
forces in an anthropomorphic deity. In the same pantheon, Hephaestus
rules fire, Poseidon the sea and earthquakes. <br>
PERI: Howard, do you have to talk at me like it was the Albuquerque
Women's League or something? <br>
FOSTER: I'm sorry. If you're not interested, then I <br>
PERI: I am interested. I just don't like being lectured, that's all. <br>
FOSTER: I must get on. I've got a great deal to do. <br>
PERI: Sure. <br>
CURT: Howard, I've got to go and find out what's happened to the
transport. <br>
FOSTER: Okay. Look, Peri, I'm really sorry I don't have the time to
talk. <br>
PERI: It's all right. I only came out to say hello and goodbye. <br>
FOSTER: Goodbye? What are you talking about? <br>
PERI: This island, Howard. I'm bored out of my mind. <br>
FOSTER: How can you be bored, for heaven's sakes? <br>
PERI: Look, I've met a couple of really nice English guys and I'm going
with them to Morocco. <br>
FOSTER: Morocco? But you're due back at college in the fall. <br>
PERI: In three months time. <br>
FOSTER: But what about your work, your ecology project, your reading
schedule? You've got exams coming up. Come on, Peri. No way are you
going to north Africa. <br>
PERI: I'm not a child. You can't stop me. <br>
FOSTER: Okay. So what are you going to use for money? <br>
PERI: I've already cashed in my return ticket for New York. I leave for
Morocco this afternoon. <br>
FOSTER: You what? How do you expect to get home? <br>
PERI: I'll get a job. <br>
FOSTER: Oh, don't make me laugh. <br>
PERI: Oh, stop playing the heavy step-father, Howard. You're not
dressed for it. <br>
FOSTER: Damn it, Peri. <br>
PERI: Please, don't let's argue. I've made up my mind. <br>
FOSTER: Okay, have it your own way. <br>
PERI: I can go? <br>
FOSTER: It's your life. <br>
PERI: You mean it? I knew you'd understand. <br>
FOSTER: There's just one thing. Reclaim your ticket to New York. I'm
not having you stranded in Morocco. Your mother'd never forgive me. <br>
PERI: But I <br>
FOSTER: Don't say it. I'll advance you the money and you can pay me
back out of your allowance. <br>
PERI: That's great. You're marvellous. <br>
FOSTER: I know. My money's on the boat. Once they've unloaded the
dinghy, we'll go out there. <br>

Did you get a precise fix on the signal? <br>
TURLOUGH: It stopped. There wasn't time. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, if it transmits again we'll get a fix on it with
this. <br>

FOSTER: I'm a fool. <br>
PERI: What's the matter? <br>
FOSTER: I've left my wallet in the hotel. <br>
PERI: I'll cable my address from Morocco. You could send the money to
me there. <br>
FOSTER: Sure, of course. <br>

FOSTER: Don't worry.</i> <br>
(The Tardis materialises on the beach. Peri hands the briefcase to
Foster who has got back into the dinghy.) <br>
FOSTER: Vamos. Sorry, Peri. You'll have to wait for the next trip. <br>
PERI: Howard! <br>
FOSTER: I'll send over another dinghy. Keep an eye on the ship, will
you? <br>
PERI: Get one of the crew to stay behind! I have to be at the airport
in an hour! <br>
FOSTER: Sorry, honey. <br>
PERI: You're doing this deliberately! <br>
FOSTER: As if I would. <br>
PERI: I will not be treated like this! <br>
FOSTER: Morocco's not going anywhere at the moment. You've got your
whole life to see it. <br>

with it, Howard! You hear me? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MALKON: Citizens of Sarn, you have all seen the
smoke from the fire mountain and felt the quaking ground. These signs
tell us it is the Time of Fire. Logar, lord of fire, is testing our
faith. <br>
(A woman walks in.) <br>
SORASTA: Testing our common sense, you mean. <br>
MALKON: The old men will tell you that soon Logar will send a sea of
fire from the heart of the mountain. <br>
SORASTA: Then we must all leave this place. <br>
MALKON: We must do nothing! <br>
SORASTA: Nothing? <br>
TIMANOV: If we have faith in Logar and are not found wanting, we will
survive and prosper. And as a reward, the Outsider will come. There
will be food and gifts we have forgotten existed. <br>
AMYAND: No! It's a lie. Logar's a myth. <br>
TIMANOV: Heretic. Unbeliever. <br>
AMYAND: We have climbed the mountain. <br>
TIMANOV: It is death to trespass on the mountain of fire. <br>
AMYAND: We've climbed the mountain and we're still alive. Logar doesn't
exist. </font></p>

everything myself? <br>
(The Doctor and Turlough look at Eros in the box on the vehicle.) <br>
CURT: And what do you want? <br>
DOCTOR: A kouros, late Classical period. It's really rather fine. I'd
hazard a guess by a pupil of Praxiteles. <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor, you're showing off. <br>
CURT: I'm inclined to agree. <br>
FOSTER: But a remarkably well-informed guess, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. It's a pity about the erosion, but the overall effect is
not unattractive, like the marine Venus on Rhodes. Has this just been
brought up from the seabed? <br>
FOSTER: Earlier today. It's proving to be a very interesting wreck out
in the bay. A real mixed bag, just like your English Mary Rose. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. But more of a mixed bag than you realise. <br>
CURT: And what does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, nothing. <br>
FOSTER: Oh, come on, Curt. No one's going to take your wreck away from
you. Nice talking to you. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye. <br>
(Foster and Curt leave.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Do you think the divers disturbed something? <br>
(The Doctor's portable detector beeps.) <br>
DOCTOR: Without a doubt. We'll need two readings to pinpoint the spot
exactly. <br>
TURLOUGH: You take one from here. It's quicker if I go back to the
Tardis. <br>

KAMELION: Do not interfere. Tardis will be taken to point of contact. I
must obey. Find point of contact. <br>
TURLOUGH: You're not taking the Tardis anywhere, and you're not
listening to any more messages from Trion. You're finished, Kamelion! <br>
(Turlough presses buttons. Kamelion squeals and stops working. <br>
(On the boat, Peri has stripped down to a bikini and put all her
belongings into a plastic bag. She jumps into the water and swims for
shore. Having removed Kamelion from the console room, Turlough spots
Peri on the scanner. She is getting into difficulties.) <br>

pulling her back to shore. <br>
The Doctor is sitting at a table sipping a drink when his detector
beeps. He puts a handful of alien tokens on the table and runs off. The
waiter is not amused, and gives chase. <br>

know the lock it operates. <br>

TURLOUGH: If it's still intact, I think I can operate the main

TURLOUGH: There was civil war on my planet. My mother was killed. My
father was on the wrong side and was exiled here with my younger

DOCTOR: But how could they possibly know you've absconded? <br>
TURLOUGH: The Trions have agents on every civilised planet. An agrarian

DOCTOR: Oh, don't be too hard on them. It's their technology that's
maintained the stability of the planet. <br>
AMYAND: You call this stability? <br>
DOCTOR: They did their best. The silver things that were seen on the
mountain, they were Trion volcanologists attempting to control the
eruptions. <br>
AMYAND: So they could imprison here their own undesirable elements.
Like fools, we've tried to make sense of things, inventing legends and
myths to explain them away. <br>

be no more Outsiders, no more Chosen Ones. <br>

caused the seismic machinery to become unstable. If I can override the
