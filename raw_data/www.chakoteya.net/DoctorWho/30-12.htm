down, which puts everything in danger. Everything. But how? <br>

storms, freak weather, patterns in the sky? <br>
DONNA: Well, how should I know? Er, no. I don't think so, no. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, okay, never mind. <br>
DONNA: Although, there were the bees disappearing. <br>
DOCTOR: The bees disappearing. The bees disappearing. The bees
disappearing! <br>
ARCHITECT: How is that significant? <br>
DONNA: On Earth we had these insects. Some people said it was pollution
or mobile phone signals. <br>
DOCTOR: Or, they were going back home. <br>
DONNA: Back home where? <br>
DOCTOR: Planet Melissa Majoria. <br>
DONNA: Are you saying bees are aliens?. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't be so daft. Not all of them. But if the migrant bees felt
something coming, some sort of danger, and escaped? Tandocca. <br>
ARCHITECT: The Tandocca Scale. <br>
DOCTOR: Tandocca Scale is the series of wavelengths used as a carrier
signals by migrant bees. Infinitely small. No wonder we didn't see it.
It's like looking for a speck of cinnamon in the Sahara, but look,
there it is. The Tandocca trail. The transmat that moved the planets
was using the same wavelength, we can follow the path. <br>
