monitor next to a logo of the Statue of Liberty.) <br>
SALLY [on monitor]: Salutations! This is Sally Calypso with the traffic
news at ten fifteen. We've got reports of a multiple stackpile at
junction five zero nine, with a spate of carjackings reported on New
Fifth Avenue. So you take care now, and drive safely. <br>
(The car shakes. The occupants are dressed in American Gothic clothes.)
<br>
MA: They're going to get in. There's no stopping them. <br>
PA: The police are on their way, I promise. I've sounded the alarm.
Repeat. This is car one zero hot five. We have a problem. Require
urgent assistance. <br>
COMPUTER: Thank you for your call. You have been placed on hold. <br>
MA: It's all your fault. You lied to the computer. You said there were
three of us. You told them three. <br>
PA: Repeat. Urgent assistance. Car one zero hot five. This is an
emergency! Help us! Oh my God, I'm begging you, please, help us! <br>
(Big bang. Sparks fly. Smoke starts to fill the car. Our last view of
the screaming occupants is a hand sliding down the monitor.) <br>
SALLY [on monitor]: The weather is at 36 degrees, and it's blue skies
all the way home. This is Sally Calypso, signing off. Missing you
already.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Just one trip. That's what I said. One trip
in the Tardis, and then home. Although I suppose we could stretch the
definition. Take one trip into past, one trip into future. How do you
fancy that? <br>
MARTHA: No complaints from me. <br>
DOCTOR: How about a different planet? <br>
MARTHA: Can we go to yours? <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, there's plenty of other places. <br>
MARTHA: Come on, though. I mean, planet of the Time Lords. That's got
to be worth a look. What's it like? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's beautiful, yeah. <br>
MARTHA: Is it like, you know, outer space cities, all spires and stuff?
<br>
DOCTOR: I suppose it is. <br>
MARTHA: Great big temples and cathedrals! <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
MARTHA: Lots of planets in the sky? <br>
DOCTOR: The sky's a burnt orange, with the Citadel enclosed in a mighty
glass dome, shining under the twin suns. Beyond that, the mountains go
on forever. Slopes of deep red grass, capped with snow. <br>
MARTHA: Can we go there? <br>
DOCTOR: Nah. Where's the fun for me? I don't want to go home. Instead,
this is much better. Year five billion and fifty-three, planet New
Earth. Second hope of mankind. Fifty thousand light years from your old
world, and we're slap bang in the middle of New New York. Although,
technically it's the fifteenth New York from the original, so it's New
New New New New New New New New New New New New New York. One of the
most dazzling cities ever built.

MARTHA: Well, it looks like the same old Earth to me, on a Wednesday
afternoon. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on. Let's have a look. <br>
(The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to get a monitor working.) <br>
SALLY [on monitor]: And the driving should be clear and easy, with
fifteen extra lanes open for the New New Jersey expressway. <br>
(A picture of a high-tec Manhattan and flying cars.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's more like it. That's the view we had last time. This
must be the lower levels, down in the base of the tower. Some sort of
under-city. <br>
MARTHA: You've brought me to the slums? <br>
DOCTOR: Much more interesting. It's all cocktails and glitter up there.
This is the real city. <br>
MARTHA: You'd enjoy anything. <br>
DOCTOR: That's me. Ah, the rain's stopping. Better and better. <br>
MARTHA: When you say last time, was that you and Rose? <br>
DOCTOR: Er, yeah. Yeah, it was, yeah. <br>
MARTHA: You're taking me to the same planets that you took her? <br>
DOCTOR: What's wrong with that? <br>
MARTHA: Nothing. Just ever heard the word rebound? <br>
(A man opens the front of his stall.) <br>
PHARMACIST 1: Oh! You should have said. How long you been there? Happy.
You want Happy. <br>
(More hatches open. The next two are women.) <br>
PHARMACIST 2: Customers. Customers! We've got customers! <br>
PHARMACIST 3: We're in business. Mother, open up the Mellow, and the
Read. <br>
PHARMACIST 1: Happy, Happy, lovely happy Happy! <br>
PHARMACIST 2: Anger. Buy some Anger! <br>
PHARMACIST 3: Get some Mellow. Makes you feel all bendy and soft all
day long. <br>
PHARMACIST 1: Don't go to them. They'll rip you off. Do you want some
happy? <br>
DOCTOR: No, thanks. <br>
MARTHA: Are they selling drugs? <br>
DOCTOR: I think they're selling moods. <br>
MARTHA: Same thing, isn't it? <br>
(More people start to enter the area, listless and dressed in rags.) <br>
PHARMACIST 3: Over here, sweetheart! That's it, come on, I'll get you
first! <br>
PHARMACIST 1: Oi! Oi, you! Over here! Over here! Buy some Happy! <br>
PHARMACIST 3: Come over here, yeah. And what can I get you, my love? <br>
WOMAN: I want to buy Forget. <br>
PHARMACIST 3: I've got Forget, my darling. What strength? How much do
you want forgetting? <br>
WOMAN: It's my mother and father. They went on the motorway. <br>
PHARMACIST 3: Oh, that's a swine. Try this. Forget Forty three. That's
two credits. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, but hold on a minute. What happened to your parents? <br>
WOMAN: They drove off. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, but they might drive back. <br>
WOMAN: Everyone goes to the motorway in the end. I've lost them. <br>
DOCTOR: But they can't have gone far. You could find them. No. No, no,
don't. <br>
(The woman sticks the Forget 43 tab to her neck.) <br>
WOMAN: I'm sorry, what were you saying? <br>
DOCTOR: Your parents. Your mother and father. They're on the motorway. <br>
WOMAN: Are they? That's nice. I'm sorry, I won't keep you. <br>
(The young woman leaves.) <br>
MARTHA: So that's the human race five billion years in the future. Off
their heads on chemicals. <br>
(A man grabs Martha from behind, and a woman points a gun at the
Doctor. The stalls all close their hatches.) <br>
MILO: I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. We just need three, that's
all. <br>
DOCTOR: No, let her go! I'm warning you, let her go! Whatever you want,
I can help. Both of us, we can help. But first you've got to let her
go. <br>
CHEEN: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Sorry. <br>
(Milo drags Martha through a green door, and Cheen locks it behind
them. They run along a passageway while the Doctor tries to get it
open.)

MARTHA: The Doctor is so going to kill you, and never mind him, I'm
going to kill you myself! Let go of me! <br>
MILO: Give her some Sleep. <br>
MARTHA: Don't you dare! Don't put that stuff in me, don't! Get off me! <br>
CHEEN: It's just Sleep Fourteen. No, baby, don't fight it. <br>

PHARMACIST 3: Thought you'd come back. Do you want some happy Happy? <br>
DOCTOR: Those people, who were they? Where did they take her? <br>
PHARMACIST 1: They've taken her to the motorway. <br>
PHARMACIST 3: Looked like carjackers to me. <br>
PHARMACIST 2: I'd give up now, darling. You won't see her again. <br>
PHARMACIST 1: Used to be thriving, this place. You couldn't move. But
they all go to the motorway in the end. <br>
DOCTOR: He kept on saying three, we need three. What did he mean,
three? <br>
PHARMACIST 3: It's the car-sharing policy, to save fuel. You get
special access if you're carrying three adults. <br>
DOCTOR: This motorway. How do I get there? <br>
PHARMACIST 3: Straight down the alley, keep going to the end. You canna
miss it. Tell you what. How about some happy Happy? Then you'll be
smiling, my love. <br>
DOCTOR: Word of advice, all of you. Cash up, close down and pack your
bags. <br>
PHARMACIST 3: Why's that, then? <br>
DOCTOR: Because as soon as I've found her, alive and well. And I will
find her alive and well. Then I'm coming back, and this street is
closing tonight!

be worth it. <br>
(Martha wakes and takes the tab from her neck.) <br>
CHEEN: Yeah. The view from the windows. You can see all the way out to
the flatlands. Clear blue sky. They say the air smells like apple
grass. Can you imagine? <br>
MILO: The houses are made of wood. There are jobs going in the
foundries. Everyone says so. <br>
(Martha points Cheen's gun at them.) <br>
MARTHA: Take me back. Whoever you are, just take me back to my friend.
That's all I want. I won't cause any trouble. Just take me back. <br>
CHEEN: I'm sorry. That's not a real gun. <br>
MARTHA: Yeah, well, you would say that. <br>
CHEEN: Where do you get a gun from, these days? I wouldn't even know
how to fire. <br>
MARTHA: No, nor me. Okay. <br>

CHEEN: What's your name? <br>
MARTHA: Martha. Martha Jones. <br>
CHEEN: Well, I'm Cheen, and this is Milo. And I swear we're sorry.
We're really, really sorry. We just needed access to the fast line, but
I promise, as soon as we arrive, we'll drop you off and you can go back
and find your friend. <br>
MARTHA: Seriously? <br>
CHEEN: I swear! Look. Honesty patch. <br>
MARTHA: All the same, it's still kidnapping! Where are we, anyway? <br>
MILO: We're on the motorway. <br>
MARTHA: What's that, then? Fog? <br>
CHEEN: That's the exhaust fumes. <br>
MILO: We're going out to Brooklyn. Everyone says the air's so much
cleaner, and we couldn't stay in Pharmacy Town, because <br>
CHEEN: Well, because of me. I'm pregnant. We only discovered it last
week. Scan says it's going to be a boy. <br>
MARTHA: Right. What do I do now, congratulate my kidnappers? <br>
CHEEN: Oh, we're not kidnappers. Not really. <br>
MARTHA: Nope? You're idiots. You're having a baby, and you're wearing
that? <br>
(Martha pulls the Honesty patch from Cheen's neck.) <br>
MARTHA: Not anymore. <br>
MILO: This'll be as fast as we can. We'll take the motorway to the
Brooklyn flyover, and then after that it's
going to take awhile, because then there's no fast lane, just ordinary
roads, but at least it's direct. <br>
CHEEN: It's only ten miles. <br>
MARTHA: How long is it going to take? <br>
CHEEN: About six years. <br>
MARTHA: What? <br>
CHEEN: Be just in time for him to start school. <br>

come?

(Brannigan removes the scarf and goggles.) <br>
BRANNIGAN: There's this story, says back in the old days, on Junction
forty seven, this woman stood in the exhaust fumes for a solid twenty
minutes. By the time they found her, her head had swollen to fifty
feet. <br>
VALERIE: Oh, you're making it up. <br>
BRANNIGAN: A fifty foot head! Just think of it. Imagine picking that
nose. <br>
VALERIE: Oh, stop it. That's disgusting. <br>

forward a short distance.) <br>

sir? Very well-dressed for a hitchhiker. <br>
DOCTOR: Thanks. Sorry, I'm the Doctor. <br>

the bane of my life, the lovely Valerie. <br>
VALERIE: Nice to meet you. <br>

basket.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, that's nice. Hello. How old are they? <br>
VALERIE: Just two months. <br>
BRANNIGAN: Poor little souls. They've never known the ground beneath
their paws. Children of the motorway. <br>
DOCTOR: What, they were born in here? <br>
VALERIE: We couldn't stop. We heard there were jobs going, out in the
laundries on Fire Island. Thought we'd take a chance. <br>
DOCTOR: What, you've been driving for two months? <br>
BRANNIGAN: Do I look like a teenager? We've been driving for twelve
years now. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry? <br>

DOCTOR: Twelve years? How far did you come? Where did you start? <br>
BRANNIGAN: Battery Park. It's five miles back. <br>
DOCTOR: You travelled five miles in twelve years? <br>
BRANNIGAN: I think he's a bit slow. <br>
VALERIE: Where are you from? <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind that. I've got to get out. My friend's in one of
these cars. She was taken hostage. I should get back to the Tardis. <br>

MARTHA: Oh, thanks. But how far down is it to this fast lane? <br>
MILO: Oh, it's right at the bottom, underneath the traffic jam. But not
many people can afford three passengers, so it's empty down there.
Rumour has it you can reach up to thirty miles per hour. <br>
MARTHA: Wow. That's, like, crazy. But how are you supposed to live
inside this thing? It's tiny. <br>
CHEEN: Oh, we stocked up. Got self-replicating fuel, muscle stimulants
for exercise, and there's a chemical toilet at the back. And all waste
products are recycled as food. <br>

MILO: It's the sound of the air vents. That's all. The exhaust fumes
travel down, so at the base of the tunnel they've got air vents. <br>
CHEEN: No, but the stories are much better. They say people go missing
on the motorway. Some cars just vanish, never to be seen again, because
there's something living down there in the smoke. Something huge and
hungry. And if you get lost on the road, it's waiting for you. <br>

BRANNIGAN: By all the cats in the kingdom! <br>
(The roof over the motorway starts to open.) <br>
VALERIE: What is it? <br>
(Daylight streams in.) <br>
VALERIE: What is it? <br>
(The travellers all start to laugh.)

it's the sunlight. <br>
DOCTOR [on monitor]: Sorry, no Sally Calypso. She was just a hologram.
My name's the Doctor. <br>
BRANNIGAN: He's a magician. <br>
DOCTOR [on monitor]: And this is an order. Everyone drive up. Right
now. <br>
BRANNIGAN: Is he serious? <br>
DOCTOR [on monitor]: I've opened the roof of the motorway. Come on.
Throttle those engines. Drive up. All of you. The whole under-city.
Drive up, drive up, drive up! Fast! <br>
BRANNIGAN: Here we go. <br>
DOCTOR [on monitor]: We've got to clear that fast lane. Drive up and
get out of the way.

MARTHA: That's the Doctor! <br>
MILO: We can't go up! We'll hit the layer! <br>
MARTHA: Just do as he says! Go up! <br>
DOCTOR [on monitor]: You've got access above. Now go! <br>
(Milo steers the car up out of the reach of the Macra.) <br>
CHEEN: It's daylight. Oh my God, that's the sky. The real sky. <br>
MARTHA: He did it! I told you, he did it!

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Hame is tending to the Face of Boe.) <br>
DOCTOR: You keep driving, Brannigan. All the way up. Because it's here,
just waiting for you. The city of New New York, and it's yours. And
don't forget I want that coat back. <br>
BRANNIGAN [OC]: I reckon that's a fair bar gain, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: And Car four six five diamond six, I've sent you a flight path.
Come to the Senate. <br>
MARTHA [OC]: On my way. <br>
DOCTOR: It's been quite a while since I saw you, Martha Jones. <br>
HAME: Doctor! <br>
(A big crack is spreading across Boe's tank. A little later, Martha
runs in and sees all the skeletons.) <br>
MARTHA: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Over here. <br>
MARTHA: Doctor! What happened out there? <br>
(The Face of Boe is out of his tank.) <br>
MARTHA: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: It's the Face of Boe. It's all right. Come and say hello. And
this is Hame. She's a cat. Don't worry. He's the one that saved you,
not me. <br>
HAME: My lord gave his life to save the city, and now he's dying. <br>
DOCTOR: No, don't say that. Not old Boe. Plenty of life left. <br>
BOE: It's good to breathe the air once more. <br>
MARTHA: Who is he? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't even know. Legend says the Face of Boe has lived for
billions of years. Isn't that right? And you're not about to give up
now. <br>
BOE: Everything has its time. You know that, old friend, better than
most. <br>
HAME: The legend says more. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't. There's no need for that. <br>
HAME: It says that the Face of Boe will speak his final secret to a
traveller. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, but not yet. Who needs secrets, eh? <br>
BOE: I have seen so much. Perhaps too much. I am the last of my kind,
as you are the last of yours, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: That's why we have to survive. Both of us. Don't go. <br>
BOE: I must. But know this, Time Lord. You are not alone. <br>
(Boe breathes out for one last time, and closes his eyes. Hame weeps.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Pharmacy Town]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: All closed down. <br>
MARTHA: Happy? <br>
DOCTOR: Happy happy. New New York can start again. And they've got
Novice Hame. Just what every city needs. Cats in charge. Come on, time
we were off. <br>
MARTHA: But what did he mean, the Face of Boe? You're not alone. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. <br>
MARTHA: You've got me. Is that what he meant? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so. Sorry. <br>
MARTHA: Then what? <br>
DOCTOR: Doesn't matter. Back to the Tardis, off we go. <br>
(Martha straightens up a chair and sits down, arms and legs crossed.) <br>
DOCTOR: All right, are you staying? <br>
MARTHA: Till you talk to me properly, yes. He said last of your kind.
What does that mean? <br>
DOCTOR: It really doesn't matter. <br>
MARTHA: You don't talk. You never say. Why not? <br>
CHOIR: (singing) Fast falls the eventide. <br>
MARTHA: It's the city. <br>
CHOIR: The darkness deepens <br>
MARTHA: They're singing. <br>
CHOIR: Lord, with me abide. When other helpers fail <br>
DOCTOR: I lied to you, because I liked it. I could pretend. Just for a
bit, I could imagine they were still alive, underneath a burnt orange
sky. I'm not just a Time Lord. I'm the last of the Time Lords. The Face
of Boe was wrong. There's no one else. <br>
MARTHA: What happened? <br>
CHOIR: Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day. <br>
DOCTOR: There was a war. A Time War. The last Great Time War. My people
fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they
lost. They lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family, my
friends, even that sky. Oh, you should have seen it, that old planet.
The second sun would rise in the south, and the mountains would shine.
The leaves on the trees were silver, and when they caught the light
every morning, it looked like a forest on fire. When the autumn came,
the breeze would blow through the branches like a song. <br>
CHOIR: The darkness deepens. Lord, with me abide. </font> </p>
