K9: Negative. Prognostication impossible in matters concerning Doctor. <br>
LEELA: Prog what? <br>
K9: I cannot tell. <br>
LEELA: Can you tell me where we've landed? <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
LEELA: Well? <br>
K9: Materialisation took place on alien spacecraft. <br>
LEELA: Why wouldn't the Doctor let me go with him? <br>
K9: I do not know. Prognostication impossible <br>
BOTH: In matters concerning. I know, I know. Well, he may need my help.
I'm going to take a look. <br>
K9: Do not touch the scanner control, mistress. <br>
LEELA: Oh, I know the Doctor said we weren't supposed to, but wouldn't
you like to see where he is? Who he's talking to? <br>
K9: Negative. Wishing for such things is emotion. I am not programmed <br>
LEELA: Oh, shut up. You're no help at all. <br>
(Leela operates the scanner controls, but nothing happens.) <br>
LEELA: What's wrong? Why won't it work? K9? K9, what's? K9, sulking is
also an emotional thing. If you cannot wish, you cannot sulk. K9! K9,
I'm sorry. <br>
(Leela tickles K9 under his chin, and he lifts his head.) <br>
LEELA: I didn't mean to shout at you. <br>
K9: Apologies are not necessary. <br>
LEELA: No, no, no, of course they're not. Now, can you tell me, please,
why this scanner will not work? <br>
K9: The Doctor immobilised the mechanism before he left in order to
prevent you switching it on. <br>

DOCTOR: But here in paragraph four sub <br>

Doctor, where have you been? <br>
DOCTOR: Order K9 to tell you to shut up. <br>
LEELA: Yes. K9, the Doctor said you're to tell me to shut up. How dare
you! <br>

Castellan is using a hand computer.) <br>

ANDRED: A report, sir. <br>
KELNER: Continue. <br>
ANDRED: Temporal scan indicates unidentified capsule approaching. <br>
KELNER: Unidentified? <br>
ANDRED: At this distance, within our own continuum, unidentified, sir. <br>
KELNER: But our own? <br>
ANDRED: Molecular patina indicates Gallifreyan origin, yes, sir, but
it's too early for a positive. <br>
KELNER: When, then? <br>
ANDRED: Approximately two minutes relative, sir. <br>
KELNER: Defences? <br>
ANDRED: Green level. <br>
KELNER: No sense in taking chances, Commander. Go to amber alert. <br>
ANDRED: Yes, sir. <br>
(Kelner gives Andred a yellow ball from his desk. Andred takes it back
to his little alcove and picks up the comm. again.) <br>
ANDRED: Main security. Commander Andred speaking. Please establish
amber alert. <br>

K9: Cheek? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, cheek. <br>
K9: Physical characteristics, humanoid facial component. <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong. <br>
K9: Tertiary data check insists definition correct. <br>

Gallifreyan. <br>
KELNER: Then what is all the fuss about? <br>
ANDRED: Still unidentified. <br>
KELNER: Unidentified? <br>
(Kelner activates his wall monitor, which displays Gallifreyan
writing.) <br>
KELNER: Only two Time Lords are absent from their duties here on
authorised research missions. You will find their molecular codes in <br>
ANDRED: Yes, sir. Neither match. I've checked. <br>
KELNER: Then who is in that capsule? Unauthorised use of a time capsule
has only one penalty, Commander. See to it. <br>
ANDRED: Yes, sir. <br>
(Andred returns to his comm. unit and makes a tannoy broadcast.) <br>
ANDRED: Commander Andred to all guard leaders. An unidentified capsule
is approaching Gallifrey. Any sentient form on board is to be arrested
on arrival. If there is no sign of life, destroy capsule as soon as it
materialises. </font></p>

K9: Immersed, master. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
K9: Totally immersed in H2O, master. <br>
DOCTOR: Fine time to take a bath. <br>
(Actually, she's swimming in a luxury indoor pool, with mosaics on the
wall and a Grecian statue holding her towel. There are ferns and potted
palms around the place too.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ANDRED: Excuse me, sir. I've decided to supervise
the destruction of the capsule personally. <br>
KELNER: Yes, of course. Remember, Commander. A sentient who can control
a time capsule is a danger. Capture, interrogate <br>

same shape and size as the Panopticon. Andred signals the other guards
to stay back. He walks forwards, then signals the seven to come
forward. They line up as a sort of honour guard. The Doctor steps out
of the Tardis, followed by Leela, and salutes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gentlemen, I'm delighted to be back on Gallifrey. <br>
(The guards all aim their small hand weapons at him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I like it. Yes, I like you. Where are you from, soldier? <br>
GUARD: Gallifrey. <br>
DOCTOR: Gallifrey? Never heard of it. Guard of honour? You're a rabble.
Nothing but a rabble. You're not fit to guard a jelly baby. (to Andred)
Would you like a jelly baby? <br>
ANDRED: We're here to arrest you. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, let's get on with it. Come on, Leela. Where do you think
you're going? <br>
LEELA: You just told me to follow you. <br>
DOCTOR: You stay here till I send for you. <br>

ANDRED: No, you follow me. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>

his gun to the Doctor's head.) <br>

ANDRED: That's the Chancellor's office. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I know it's the Chancellor's office. <br>
ANDRED: Well, no one goes in there unannounced. <br>

ANDRED: Forgive the intrusion, sir. An unexpected emergency has arisen.
<br>
(The Doctor enters.) <br>
BORUSA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: I am here to claim my legal right. <br>
BORUSA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: I claim the inheritance of Rassilon. I claim the titles,
honour, duty and obedience of all colleges. I claim the Presidency of
the Council of Time Lords. <br>

BORUSA: No, only the arrogance with which you present it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Borusa, how you used to bore me with your interminable
lectures on responsibility and duty. <br>
BORUSA: Which obviously failed. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>
BORUSA: You make me regret teaching you anything at all. <br>
DOCTOR: You taught me nothing. Nothing that instinct couldn't provide
better. <br>
BORUSA: Then you must trust your instincts. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. And you yours, Lord Borusa. <br>
BORUSA: I'll do what I can to persuade the Cardinals to accept you as
their President. <br>
DOCTOR: I am the President! No persuasion is necessary. <br>
BORUSA: Politeness dictates <br>
DOCTOR: I am the President! Is there another candidate legally? <br>
BORUSA: No. That was an unfortunate oversight. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
BORUSA: I meant no disrespect. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes you did. Borusa, before you go, another lesson. <br>
BORUSA: On what particular subject? <br>
DOCTOR: The Constitution. <br>
BORUSA: You had that at your fingertips last time we met. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and if I hadn't, you would have killed me. <br>
BORUSA: Not I, the then Chancellor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, Did you, did you just assume his Office? <br>
BORUSA: The Council ratified my appointment. <br>
DOCTOR: Without a President, the Council can ratify nothing. <br>
BORUSA: There was no President, and the President-elect was elsewhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. But my point is. Borusa! You haven't been give leave to
depart yet. <br>
BORUSA: And until you have been confirmed and inducted as President, I
do not need your leave to do anything. <br>
DOCTOR: The ceremony must take place at once. <br>
BORUSA: As soon as possible. <br>
DOCTOR: At once! <br>
(Borusa nods, and leaves by a pair of double doors.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LEADER: This needs thought. <br>
VARDAN: The course is obvious. <br>
LEADER: I may reconsider. The Doctor could be more use to us alive. He
understands discipline. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Castellan's office]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BORUSA: No discipline, that's always been the
trouble. <br>
KELNER: He understands the dangers? He accepts the risks of induction
without the necessary preparations? <br>
BORUSA: He accepts nothing. That's always been the trouble with him. No
discipline. <br>
(Andred enters.) <br>
ANDRED: Forgive me, sirs. The President-elect desires your immediate
attendance. <br>
BORUSA: Then let him rot in a black star. <br>
ANDRED: It is his request, sirs. <br>
(Andred's hand moves towards his holster.) <br>
KELNER: After all, Chancellor, a request is a request. And it's only a
matter of time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Chancellory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: It's always a matter of time, eh,
Castellan? Especially for Time Lords. What do you think about my
office? <br>
KELNER: Oh, it's simply a formality. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes, I know that. No, I meant my quarters. You know,
room of ones own, somewhere to be. I do so hate squatting. <br>
BORUSA: The President's quarters are inadequate. <br>
DOCTOR: Correct. Have them refurbished. <br>
KELNER: In what style? <br>
BORUSA: We are not his lackeys. We are Time Lords of the Supreme
Council. I am Chancellor. <br>
DOCTOR: Illegally. <br>
BORUSA: I am a Cardinal, then. That at least. <br>

KELNER: With the merest hint of Simian Empire? <br>
DOCTOR: Second dynasty, of course. <br>
KELNER: Of course. <br>
BORUSA: In short, Earth, twentieth century. <br>

KELNER: Now, that's Sol Three, relative dates zero three four one four

DOCTOR: No, no, no. I prefer four three seven zero eleven nine. <br>
KELNER: Yes, of course, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
KELNER: It will, of course, take a little time, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Well that's something we've plenty of, eh, Cardinal? I mean,
Chancellor-elect? <br>
KELNER: Will that be all, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: No. See to my friend, Leela. Make sure she has comfortable
quarters and suitable clothes for my induction. She will attend. <br>
(Borusa opens his mouth to protest.) <br>
KELNER: Yes, of course, sir. <br>
(Kelner bows and leaves.) <br>
BORUSA: May I go also, President-elect? <br>
DOCTOR: No. We have things to discuss. <br>
BORUSA: What things? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the redecorations, for one. <br>
BORUSA: I'm sure the Lord Castellan is quite capable of <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes. Quite. But I'd be so very grateful if you'd help him
with the small things. The good Castellan has his flaws, hmm? I mean,
his experience hardly extends to Earth zero seven three period. <br>
BORUSA: Zero seven three? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you remember all those marvellous panels, hmm? Very
primitive, of course. <br>
BORUSA: Yes, I remember. Where would you like them? <br>
DOCTOR: Everywhere. <br>
BORUSA: Everywhere? <br>
DOCTOR: Everywhere. Floor, ceilings, wall, everywhere. <br>
BORUSA: But lead? <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. <br>

DOCTOR: It is. <br>
BORUSA: Only a few have mastered the art. <br>

Everything. All the information that has ever been stored, all the
