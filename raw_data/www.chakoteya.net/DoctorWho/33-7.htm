DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
GIRL: Why are you sitting on a swing? <br>
DOCTOR: Why shouldn't I? <br>
GIRL: Because you're old. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true. That is very true. <br>
GIRL: My mum says I shouldn't talk to strange men. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, you mum's right. <br>
GIRL: Are you strange? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. I'm way past strange. I think I'm probably
incredible. <br>
GIRL: Are you lonely? <br>
DOCTOR: Why would I be lonely? <br>
GIRL: Because you're sad. Have you lost something? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
GIRL: When I lose something, I go to a quiet place and I close my eyes,
and then I can remember where I put it. <br>
DOCTOR: Good plan. <br>
GIRL: I'm always losing things. I lost my best pencil, my schoolbag,
and my gran, and my mojo. <br>
DOCTOR: Your mojo? <br>
GIRL: I got it back, though. <br>
DOCTOR: Hey, that's good. <br>
GIRL: What did you lose? <br>
DOCTOR: My friend. I met her twice before and I lost her both times,
and now I don't think I'll ever find her again. <br>
GIRL: Have you been looking? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, everywhere. <br>
GIRL: That's sad. <br>
DOCTOR: It is a bit. Hey, is that your mum? <br>
GIRL: Yeah, I'd better go and see if she's all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I think you better had. <br>
GIRL: How are you going to find her? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, the first two times I met her, I just sort of bumped into
her, so I thought maybe if I just wandered about a bit, I might bump
into her again. You know, like destiny, sort of. <br>
GIRL: That's rubbish. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I think it probably is. Hey, maybe I could find a quiet
room and have a good think about it instead. <br>
GIRL: That would be better. Goodbye. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye. <br>
GIRL: Mister, I hope you find her again. <br>
DOCTOR: So do I. <br>
MUM: Who was that? <br>
GIRL: I was talking to a sad man. <br>
MUM: Look, Clara Oswald, what have I told you about talking to strange
men?

DOCTOR: Oh, quite a lot, actually. Angie called. She's going to stay
over at Nina's. Apparently that's all completely fine and you shouldn't
worry like you always do. For god's sake get off her back. Also, your
dad phoned, mainly about the government. He seems very cross with them,
I've got several pages on that. I said I'd look into it. I fixed that
rattling noise in the washing machine, indexed the kitchen cupboards,
optimised photosynthesis in the main flower bed and assembled a
quadricycle. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The base station removes the leather helmet and
turns its head around. Miss Kizlet cowers.) <br>
KIZLET: No, not me! Not me! <br>
(A bright light flashes out from the Shard.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KIZLET [on screen]: Put me back. Put me back!
Download me at once! That is an order. That is an order! <br>
ALEXI: But she's fully integrated now. We'll have to download the
entire cloud. We can't do that. <br>
MAHLER: No, we can't. <br>
KIZLET [on screen]: Download me! <br>
(The base station returns its face to the front and picks up Miss
Kizlet's iPad. It selects Mahler's profile and ups his obedience to
maximum.) <br>
KIZLET [on screen]: Download me! <br>
MAHLER: Do what she says. <br>
(Alexi obeys, and the faces disappear from the small screens on the
back wall. Around the world, the wifi changes from red to blue.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAHLER: You have no right to be in this office, and
I am demanding that you leave at once. <br>
OFFICER: This building is under UNIT control. <br>
MAHLER: What is UNIT? Never heard of you. <br>
OFFICER: Just you calm down, sir.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(She summons up the face of Richard E Grant on her
wall screen.) <br>
KIZLET: UNIT are here. Friends of the Doctor, I presume. <br>
GREAT INTELLIGENCE [on screen]: Oh, old friends. Very old friends. <br>
KIZLET: Then I appear to have failed you, Great Intelligence. <br>
GREAT INTELLIGENCE [on screen]: I have feasted on many minds. I have
grown. But now it is time for you to reduce. <br>
KIZLET: You've been whispering in my ear so long, I'm not sure I
remember what I was before. <br>
GREAT INTELLIGENCE [on screen]: Goodbye, Miss Kizlet. <br>
(Miss Kizlet backs away, then selects Restore Factory Settings on her
iPad. There is a grating noise, and all the workers grab their heads in
pain.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALEXI: Sorry. Where am I? What am I doing here? Are
you soldiers? What's happening? How did I get here? <br>
MAHLER: Excuse me, where are the toilets? <br>
ALEXI: The toilets? <br>
MAHLER: I'm here to fix the toilets, the gents. How long have I been
here?

KIZLET: Where are my mummy and daddy? They said they wouldn't be long.
Are they coming back?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(At the Maitland home, Clara sees the Tardis
outside the window. She goes and knocks on the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come in. <br>
CLARA: So, he comes back, does he? <br>
DOCTOR: You didn't answer my question. <br>
CLARA: What question? <br>
DOCTOR: You don't seem like a nanny. <br>
CLARA: I was going to travel. I came to stay for a week before I left,
and during that week <br>
DOCTOR: She died, so you're returning the favour. You've got a hundred
and one places to see, and you haven't been to any of them, have you?
That's why you keep the book. <br>
CLARA: I keep the book because I'm still going. <br>
DOCTOR: But you don't run out on the people you care about. Wish I was
more like that. You know, the thing about a time machine, you can run
away all you like and still be home in time for tea, so what do you
say? Anywhere. All of time and space, right outside those doors. <br>
CLARA: Does this work? <br>
DOCTOR: Eh? <br>
CLARA: Is this actually what you do? Do you just crook your finger and
people just jump in your snog box and fly away? <br>
DOCTOR: It is not a snog box. <br>
CLARA: I'll be the judge of that. <br>
DOCTOR: Starting when? <br>
CLARA: Come back tomorrow. Ask me again. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? <br>
CLARA: Because tomorrow, I might say yes. Sometime after seven okay for
you? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a time machine. Any time's okay. <br>
CLARA: See you then. <br>
DOCTOR: Clara? In your book there was a leaf. Why? <br>
CLARA: That wasn't a leaf. That was page one. <br>
(Clara leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right then, Clara Oswald. Time to find out who you are. <br>
