oil lamp. It comes in and Martha gets out. The boat and its crew
leave.) <br>
MARTHA: What's your name, then? <br>
TOM: Tom Milligan. No need to ask who you are. The famous Martha Jones.
How long since you were last in Britain? <br>
MARTHA: Three hundred and sixty five days. It's been a long year. <br>
TOM: So what's the plan? <br>
MARTHA: This Professor Docherty. I need to see her. Can you get me
there? <br>
TOM: She works in a repair shed, Nuclear Plant Seven. I can get you
inside. What's all this for? What's so important about her? <br>
MARTHA: Sorry, the more you know, the more you're at risk. <br>
TOM: There's a lot of people depending on you. You're a bit of a
legend. <br>
MARTHA: What does the legend say? <br>
TOM: That you sailed the Atlantic, walked across America. That you were
the only person to get out of Japan alive. Martha Jones, they say,
she's going to save the world. Bit late for that. <br>
(They walk up to a flat bed van.) <br>
MARTHA: How come you can drive? Don't you get stopped? <br>
TOM: Medical staff. Used to be in paediatrics back in the old days. But
that gives me a licence to travel so I can help out other the labour
camps. <br>
MARTHA: Great. I'm travelling with a doctor.

stands on high, playing track three. <br>
(The Master enters the flight deck and starts dancing to I Can't Decide
by Scissor Sisters. He goes up to Lucy, kisses her and they dance
together.) <br>
SINGER: I can't decide whether you should live or die. Though you'll
probably go to Heaven,
please don't hang your head and cry. No wonder why my heart feels dead
inside. It's cold and hard and petrified. Lock the doors and close the
blinds, we're going for a ride. Oh, I could throw you in a lake or feed
you poisoned birthday cake. I won't deny I'm
going to miss you when you're gone. <br>

Doctor crawls out of his straw-strewn tent. The Master forces him into
a wheelchair and takes him for a push around the deck.) <br>

and kill me when I'm sleeping, that's why I can't decide whether you

going for a ride. <br>
MASTER: It's ready to rise, Doctor. The new Time Lord Empire. It's
good, isn't it? Isn't it good? Anything? No? Anything? Oh, but they
broke your hearts, didn't they, those Toclafane, ever since you worked
out what they really are. They say Martha Jones has come back home. Now
why would she do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Leave her alone. <br>
MASTER: But you said something to her, didn't you? On the day I took
control. What did you tell her? <br>
DOCTOR: I have one thing to say to you. You know what it is. <br>
MASTER: Oh no, you don't! <br>

TANNOY: Valiant now entering Zone One airspace. Citizens rejoice. <br>
MASTER: Come on, people! What are we doing? Launch Day in twenty four

rocks.) <br>
MARTHA: All over the Earth, those things. He's even carved himself into
Mount Rushmore. <br>
TOM: Best to keep down. Here we go. The entire south coast of England,
converted into shipyards. They bring in slave labour every morning.
Break up cars, houses, anything, just for the metal. Building a fleet
out of scrap. <br>
(A fleet of space rockets.) <br>
MARTHA: You should see Russia. That's Shipyard Number One. All the way
from the Black Sea to the Bering Strait, there's a hundred thousand
rockets getting ready for war. <br>
TOM: War? With who? <br>
MARTHA: The rest of the universe. I've been out there, Tom, in space,
before all this happened, and there's a thousand different
civilisations all around us with no idea of what's happening here. The
Master can build weapons big enough to devastate them all. <br>
TOM: You've been in space? <br>
MARTHA: Problem with that? <br>
TOM: No. No, just er, wow. Anything else I should know? <br>
MARTHA: I've met Shakespeare. <br>
(Two spheres fly in from behind the statue.) <br>
SPHERE: Identify, little man. <br>
TOM: I've got a licence. Thomas Milligan, Peripatetic Medical Squad.
I'm allowed to travel. I was just checking for <br>
SPHERE: Soon the rockets will fly, and everyone will need medicine.
You'll be so busy. <br>
(The spheres fly off to the shipyard, laughing.) <br>
TOM: But they didn't see you. <br>
MARTHA: How do you think I travelled the world? <br>
(She is wearing the Tardis key. They go back to the van.) <br>
MARTHA: Because the Master set up Archangel, that mobile network,
fifteen satellites around the planet, but really it's transmitting this
low level psychic field. That's how everyone got hypnotised into
thinking he was Harold Saxon. <br>
TOM: Saxon. Feels like years ago. <br>
MARTHA: But the key's tuned in to the same frequency. Makes me sort of
not invisible, just unnoticeable. <br>
TOM: Well, I can see you. <br>
MARTHA: That's because you wanted to. <br>
TOM: Yeah, I suppose I did. <br>
MARTHA: Is there a Mrs Milligan? <br>
TOM: No. No. What about you? <br>
MARTHA: There used to be someone. <br>
(She remembers the Doctor kissing her, then whispering to her.) <br>
MARTHA: A long time ago. Come on, I've got to find this Docherty woman.
<br>
TOM: We'll have to wait until the next work shift. What time is it now?
<br>
MARTHA: It's nearly three o'clock.

bridge. The Doctor, Francine and Tish are there, whilst Clive is still
cleaning below decks. Jack can see a clock from his cage, too, and
starts to pull on his chains. The Master enters the flight deck.) <br>
MASTER: Time for my massage. Who shall I have today? Tanya. Come on,
sweetheart. Lucy, have you met Tanya? She's gorgeous. Tanya, when we go
to the stars, I'm going to take you to the Catriga Nova. Whirlpools of
gold. <br>
(With seconds to go to 3 o'clock, Jack's chains are coming free of the
wall.) <br>
MASTER: You two should get to know each other. That might be fun. <br>
(Tanya massages the Master's shoulders.) <br>
On the stroke of 3, Jack is free. He grabs a steam hose and points it
at the guard. Clive throws water on an electrical circuit and starts a
fire.) <br>
TANNOY: Condition red. <br>
MASTER: What the hell? <br>
TANNOY: Repeat, condition red. <br>

Doctor who takes the laser screwdriver from the pocket and points it at
the Master.) <br>

MASTER: Say sorry! <br>
FRANCINE: Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. <br>
TISH: Mum! <br>
MASTER: Didn't you learn anything from the blessed Saint Martha? Siding
with the Doctor is a very dangerous thing to do. Take them away. <br>
GUARD: Move. Come on. <br>
MASTER: Okay. Gotcha. <br>
(The Master helps the Doctor into a chair as Tish and Francine are
taken away.) <br>
MASTER: Oh boy. There you go, Gramps. Oh, do you know, I remember the
days when the Doctor, oh, that famous Doctor, was waging a Time War,
battling Sea Devils and Axons. He sealed the rift at the Medusa Cascade
single handed. And look at him now. Stealing screwdrivers. How did he
ever come to this? Oh yeah, me. <br>
DOCTOR: I just need you to listen. <br>

TOM: They, er, they sent word ahead. I'm Tom Milligan. This is Martha
Jones. <br>
DOCHERTY: She can be the Queen of Sheba for all I care. I'm still busy.

MARTHA: Televisions don't work anymore. <br>
DOCHERTY: Oh God, I miss Countdown. Never been the same since Des took
over. Both Deses. What's the plural for Des? Desi? Deseen? But we've
been told there's going to be a transmission from the man himself. <br>
(A static-ridden black and white image appears.) <br>
DOCHERTY: There! <br>

hello, Gandalf. Except he's not that old, but he's an alien with a much

TOM: I'm sorry. <br>
MARTHA: The Doctor's still alive. <br>
DOCHERTY: Obviously the Archangel Network would seem to be the Master's
greatest weakness. Fifteen satellites all around the Earth, still
transmitting. That's why there's so little resistance. It's
broadcasting a telepathic signal that keeps people scared. <br>
TOM: We could just take them out. <br>
DOCHERTY: We could. Fifteen ground to air missiles. You got any on you?
Besides, any military action, the Toclafane descend. <br>
MARTHA: They're not called Toclafane. That's a name the Master made up.
<br>
DOCHERTY: Then what are they, then? <br>
MARTHA: That's why I came to find you. Know your enemy. I've got this. <br>
(A computer disc.) <br>
MARTHA: No one's been able to look at a sphere close up. They can't
even be damaged, except once. The lightning strike in South Africa
brought one of them down, just by chance. I've got the readings on
this. <br>
(Docherty puts the disc into her computer, and thumps it as it
struggles to read the data.) <br>
DOCHERTY: Oh, whoever thought we'd miss Bill Gates. <br>
TOM: So is that why you travelled the world? To find a disc? <br>
MARTHA: No. Just got lucky. <br>
DOCHERTY: I heard stories that you walked the Earth to find a way to
build a weapon. There! A current of fifty eight point five kiloamperes
transferred charge of five hundred and ten megajoules precisely. <br>
TOM: Can you recreate that? <br>
DOCHERTY: I think so. Easily. Yes. <br>
MARTHA: Right then, Doctor Milligan, we're going to get us a sphere. <br>
(Outside Tom fires a gun three times. A sphere chases him.) <br>
MARTHA: He's coming. You ready? <br>
DOCHERTY: You do your job, I'll do mine! <br>

TOM: Now! <br>

passageway. After a few moments, it drops to the ground.) <br>

drumbeat. Ever since I was a child. I looked into the vortex. That's

ruins of New York to the fusion mills of China, right across the
radiation pits of Europe. And everywhere I went, I saw people just like
you, living as slaves. But if Martha Jones became a legend, then that's
wrong, because my name isn't important. There's someone else. The man
who sent me out there. The man who told me to walk the Earth. And his
name is the Doctor. He has saved your lives so many times, and you
never even knew he was there. He never stops. He never stays. He never
asks to be thanked. But I've seen him. I know him. I love him. And I
know what he can do. <br>
WOMAN: It's him! It's him! Oh my God, it's him! It's the Master. He's
here. <br>

Nothing? Positions. I'll give the order unless you surrender. Ask
yourself. What would the Doctor do?
(Martha takes off the Tardis key and goes outside.) <br>
MASTER: Oh, yes. Oh, very well done. Good girl. He trained you well.
Bag. Give me the bag. No, stay there. Just throw it. <br>
(Martha throws her backpack towards the Master, who fires his laser

<br>
SPHERES [in orbit]: We will fly and blaze and slice. We will fly and

MASTER: At zero, to mark this day, the child Martha Jones, will die. My
first blood. Any last words? No? Such a disappointment, this one. Days
of old, Doctor, you had companions who could absorb the time vortex.
This one's useless. Bow your head. And so it falls to me, as Master of
all, to establish from this day, a new order of Time Lords. From this
day forward <br>

MASTER: What. What's so funny? <br>
MARTHA: A gun. <br>

knew about her son. <br>

MARTHA: Don't you want to know what I was doing, travelling the world? <br>
MASTER: Tell me. <br>
MARTHA: I told a story, that's all. No weapons, just words. I did just
what the Doctor said. I went across the continents all on my own. And
everywhere I went, I found the people, and I told them my story. <br>
MARTHA [in slave quarters]: He has saved your lives so many times, and
you never even knew he was there. I know him. <br>
MARTHA: I told them about the Doctor. <br>
MARTHA [in slave quarters]: I love him. <br>
MARTHA: And I told them to pass it on, to spread the word so that
everyone would know about the Doctor. <br>
MASTER: Faith and hope? Is that all? <br>
MARTHA: No, because I gave them an instruction, just as the Doctor
said. <br>
(Martha stands up.) <br>
DOCTOR [memory]: Use the countdown. <br>
MARTHA: I told them that if everyone thinks of one word, at one
specific time <br>
MASTER: Nothing will happen. Is that your weapon? Prayer? <br>
MARTHA: Right across the world, in word, just one thought at one moment
but with fifteen satellites. <br>
MASTER: What? <br>

MARTHA: A telepathic field binding the whole human race together, with
all of them, every single person on Earth, thinking the same thing at
the same time. And that word is Doctor. <br>

still around him and it doesn't get through.) <br>

this bloke was called Sean. And she loved him. She did. She completely
adored him. Spent all day long talking about him. <br>
DOCTOR: Is this going anywhere? <br>

her, but that was it. And she wasted years pining after him. Years of
her life. Because while he was around, she never looked at anyone else.
And I told her, I always said to her, time and time again, I said, get
out. So this is me, getting out. <br>
