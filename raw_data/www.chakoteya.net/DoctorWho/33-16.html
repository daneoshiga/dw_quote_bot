[OC]: Once, there was a planet, much like any other, and unimportant.
This planet sent the universe a message. A bell tolling among the
stars, ringing out to all the dark corners of creation. And everybody
came to see. <br>
(A huge space fleet of Judoon, Terileptils, Silurians et al is orbiting
an icy ringed
planet. Three tones are being repeated over and over again.) <br>
TASHA [OC]: Although no one understood the message, everyone who heard
it found themselves afraid. Except one man. The man who stayed for
Christmas.

carrying a Dalek eye-stalk.) <br>
DOCTOR: I bring proof of courage and comradeship. What is this ship and
why are you here? Identify yourselves by species and planet of origin. <br>
DALEK: Exterminate! <br>
(The Doctor communicates with an unseen accomplice.) <br>
DOCTOR: Handles? <br>
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! <br>

range.) <br>

Handles, I said, put me on a ship. I didn't say, put me on a Dalek
ship. <br>

on the console.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't put me on a Dalek ship when I'm holding a broken bit of
Dalek! <br>
(The Doctor hits the head with the eye-stalk.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ow! <br>
HANDLES: You did not indicate a preference. <br>
DOCTOR: Use your head. <br>
(He takes it off the stand and paces with it.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not like you've got a lot of alternatives. They're all
here. Daleks, Sontarans, Terileptils, Slitheen. And they're not even
fighting, they're just parked. Why? <br>
HANDLES: The message was received throughout the universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the message, the message. Even I can't translate it.
I mean, why is everyone here if they don't understand it? <br>
HANDLES: You're here. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you know, I'm OCD. What's their excuse? What does this
message mean? <br>
(The emergency phone outside rings. He puts the head back on its
stand.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no. And remind me I've got to patch the telephone back
through the console unit. This is getting ridiculous. <br>
HANDLES: Attention. Information available. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay? <br>
HANDLES: You must patch the telephone device back through the console
unit. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. No, no, no, no. No, not now. Remind me later. <br>
HANDLES: When? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Just later. Just pick a time. <br>
HANDLES: When? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Just any old time. When you think I've forgotten.
<br>
HANDLES: When? <br>
DOCTOR: Just pick a random number, express that number as a quantity of
minutes, and when that time has elapsed, remind me to patch the
telephone back through the console unit. <br>
HANDLES: Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: How those Cyber-evenings must fly. <br>

DOCTOR: Ding dong. Okay, brilliant. I may be a bit rusty in some areas,
but I will glance at a manual. <br>
CLARA: No, no, you're not actually my boyfriend. <br>
(The turkey is nowhere near ready, although the roast potatoes look
done.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that was quick. It's a roller coaster this phone call. <br>
CLARA: But I need a boyfriend really quickly. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I hope you're nicer to the next one. <br>
CLARA: No, shut up. Christmas dinner. Me cooking. <br>
DOCTOR: So? <br>
CLARA: So, I may have accidentally invented a boyfriend. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, I did that once and there's no easy way to get rid of an
android. <br>
CLARA: No, not an android. A pretend one, an imaginary one. And I said
he'd be coming to Christmas dinner. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. <br>
(The scanner has picked up an unidentified new vessel in orbit. The
Doctor drops
the telephone receiver.) <br>
DOCTOR: Handles, that's a new ship. Okay, we'll take the Tardis this

CLARA: I just need you to come for Christmas dinner. Just do that for

CYBERMAN: Alert. Alert. <br>
DOCTOR: Peace. No. <br>
CYBERMAN: Intruder detected. The intruder will be upgraded. <br>
(Lots of Cybermen leave their cubicles and start shooting. Really bad
shots again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Argh! Sorry. <br>

LINDA: How's the turkey doing? <br>
CLARA: Great. Yeah, yeah, it's doing great. Well, dead and decapitated,

DOCTOR: Hello, handsome. Anyone for Twister? <br>
CLARA: So, this is the Doctor. My boyfriend. Isn't anyone going to say

GRAN: Hello. <br>

DOCTOR: Excuse me a moment. Listen, I've got an idea to break the ice.
Why don't I project my clothes hologram onto their visual cortexes too?

DOCTOR: I think a decent vet would give it an even chance. <br>
CLARA: Okay. Well, use an app. <br>
DOCTOR: An app? <br>
CLARA: On your screwdriver. App it. <br>

CLARA: Ooo, vortex cooking? <br>

DOCTOR: Yep, exposure to the time winds. It'll either come up a treat,
or just possibly lay some eggs. <br>
HANDLES: Information available. <br>
CLARA: What's that? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, just a bit of a Cyberman. He'll get us to the church on

HANDLES: I have developed a fault. <br>
DOCTOR: The organics are all gone, but there's still a full set of data
banks. Found it at the Maldovar market. <br>
(They zoom back to the snow planet.) <br>
HANDLES: Planet identified from analysis of message. <br>
DOCTOR: Right, cool. Go on then. Okay, tell us, what is the planet? Go
on. <br>
HANDLES: Processing official designation. Processing. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, in your own time, dear. Don't rush. <br>
CLARA: So why haven't you just gone down there and had a look? <br>
DOCTOR: It's shielded. Even the Tardis can't break through it. <br>
HANDLES: Gallifrey. <br>

HANDLES: Gallifrey. <br>
DOCTOR: What are you talking about? Gallifrey? What do you mean? <br>
HANDLES: Confirmed. Planet designation, Gallifrey. <br>

DOCTOR: You see that? Gallifrey is my home. I know it when I see it.
That is not Gallifrey. <br>
CLARA: Doctor, are you okay. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not Gallifrey. Gallifrey is gone. <br>
CLARA: Unless, unless you saved it. You thought you might have. <br>
(They look out of the Tardis doors down at the white planet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Even if it survived, it's gone from this universe. That is not
my home. <br>
(They go back inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: It can't be. <br>
(There is a big fog horn blast outside.) <br>
CLARA: What's that? <br>
(They look out of the door again, at a big square Borg-style
spaceship.) <br>
DOCTOR: Papal Mainframe. It's like a great big flying church. The first
ship to arrive. They are the ones who shielded the planet. They can get
us down there. <br>
(The Doctor bows to a large holographic face.) <br>
CLARA: A friend of yours? <br>
DOCTOR: Tasha Lem, the Mother Superious. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh, she's inviting us aboard. <br>
CLARA: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I asked her. Swallow this. <br>

DOCTOR: The Church of the Papal Mainframe, security hub of the known
universe. <br>
CLARA: A security church? <br>
DOCTOR: Yep. Keeping you safe in this world and the next. I venerate
the exaltation of the Mother Superious. <br>

appreciated. <br>

DOCTOR: Loving the frock. <br>
TASHA: Is that a new body? Give us a twirl. <br>

TASHA: Nice though. Tight. <br>

you could sneak me down there, couldn't you, Tash? <br>
TASHA: I would have conditions. (to Clara) I have confidential matters
to discuss with the Doctor. Would you excuse us? <br>
DOCTOR: Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Clara.
Well, quite a lot of it. Probably about half. Maybe a smidge under.
Actually, Clara, would you mind waiting out here, please? <br>
CLARA: No worries. You two get yourselves a room. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. No, stop it. <br>

DOCTOR: Yep. <br>

like it. She reaches across and touches a panel on the headrest, or is
it footrest, and the three tone message plays. They get inside each
others personal space.) <br>
TASHA: That message is transmitting through all of space and time. What
did it make you feel? <br>
DOCTOR: Feel? <br>
TASHA: Every sentient being in the universe who detected that signal
felt something. Something overpowering. <br>

from? <br>
TASHA: It's a settlement. Human colony, level two. A farm, basically. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. Anyone been for a look? <br>
TASHA: Any one ship lands, the rest will follow. There will be
bloodshed. Fortunately we got here first, shielded the planet. We
maintain the truce by blocking all of them. <br>
DOCTOR: Daleks, Cybermen, one of that lot, could break through your
defences. <br>
TASHA: Perhaps. But they're afraid, remember? Nobody wants to go first.

there. <br>

DOCTOR: The Tardis doesn't work by remote. Fine. If it makes you feel
any better, there we are. <br>

CLARA: What's wrong? It's only a crack in the wall. <br>
(It is The Crack, the time field caused by the exploding Tardis in the
Pandorica Opens / Big Bang
stories, that haunted the first season with Amy Pond.) <br>
DOCTOR: I knew. I always knew it wasn't over. <br>
CLARA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: A split in the skin of reality. <br>
(As he touches it, he is remembers other times the crack was there.) <br>
DOCTOR: A tiny sliver of the 26th of June, 2010. The day the universe
blew up. <br>
CLARA: Missed that. <br>
DOCTOR: I rebooted it, put it all back together. <br>
CLARA: That's good. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it was my Tardis that blew it up in the first place. I
felt a degree of responsibility. But the scar tissue remains. A
structural weakness in the whole universe. Whoa! And someone's trying
to get through it from outside our universe, from somewhere else. Of
course. Of course. It makes sense. <br>
CLARA: It does? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. If you were trying to break through a wall, you'd choose
the weakest spot. If you were trying to break into this universe, you'd
choose this crack, because. No. If you were trying to break back into
this universe. (to Handles) You said Gallifrey. Why did you say
Gallifrey? <br>
HANDLES: Analysis of message composition indicates Gallifreyan origin,
according to Tardis databanks. <br>
CLARA: You said Gallifrey was gone. <br>
DOCTOR: No. I said it was in another universe. The message is coming
through here. The truth field is too, at a guess. If it's the Time
Lords.
If it's the Time Lords. <br>
(He takes a large round item from his trouser pocket.)<br>
DOCTOR: Seal of the High Council of Gallifrey. Nicked it off the Master
in the Death Zone. (Five Doctors) There is an algorithm imprinted in
the atomic structure. Use it to decode the message. <br>
(He puts the Seal on Handle's forehead.) <br>
HANDLES: Message decoding. Message analysis proceeding. Information
available. The message is a request for information. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a question. Why can't you just say it's a question? <br>
HANDLES: It is being projected through all of time and space on a
repeating cycle. <br>
DOCTOR: The oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight. <br>
HANDLES: Warning. Translation will be available to all lifeforms in
range. Translation follows. Doctor who? (slightly different voice each
time.) Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who? Doctor who?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BARNABLE: If you're not leaving, why did you bring
it back? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a reminder. Besides, I might leave tomorrow. Or the next
day. Or the day after that. <br>
(Time passes. Metal Cybermen beam in and start shooting. The villagers
scream and run as the Papal troops and Silents fight back.) <br>
TASHA [OC]: And so, to the fields of Trenzalore came all the Time
Lord's enemies. For this was the winter of the Doctor. In time, when
all other races had retreated or burned, only the Church of the
Mainframe remained in the path of the Daleks. And so those ancient
enemies, the Doctor and the Silence, stood back to back on the fields
of Trenzalore.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It was not a happy meal.)<br>
TOY PENGUIN: Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas, everyone. <br>
LINDA: Other fish in the sea, that's what I'm saying. <br>
DAD: Linda, I don't think Clara wants to talk about it. <br>
LINDA: I've got a suggestion, that's all. I've got a list of
suggestions. <br>
DAD: Linda. <br>
LINDA: You could make a boy band out of my list. <br>
CLARA: I hate boy bands. <br>
LINDA: Of course you don't, not at your age. <br>
GRAN: These crackers are rubbish. <br>
LINDA: I bought them. <br>
GRAN: I know. <br>
LINDA: They're classy. <br>
GRAN: They don't have jokes. <br>
LINDA: Exactly. <br>
GRAN: They've got poems. <br>
LINDA: They're more dramatic crackers. <br>
GRAN: I like the jokes. <br>
CLARA: Tell us a joke, Gran. You know loads of jokes. <br>
LINDA: I think we're probably talking about my list now. <br>
CLARA: Probably not. <br>
DAD: Tell us how you met Dad. The thing about the pigeon. <br>
GRAN: I saw him on a pier on a rainy day. <br>
DAD: No, no, not that one. The one about the pigeon. <br>
GRAN: I'd seen him before, lots of times, but he just looked so
beautiful standing there. <br>
DAD: The pigeon in the restaurant. You remember? <br>
GRAN: I wanted everything to stop. I wanted nothing to change ever
again. <br>
(Clara starts crying.) <br>
GRAN: If he could just keep standing there, so beautiful. A long time
ago. Don't hug me so tight, dear. You'll break something. <br>
LINDA: Oh, that's nice. Crying at Christmas. <br>
CLARA: Sorry. <br>
GRAN: I hope you made a wish. <br>
(The sound of a time rotor is heard. Clara gets up and runs out to the
kitchen window to see the Tardis appearing.) <br>
DAD: Clara? What's wrong, Clara. <br>
CLARA: Everybody just stay put. <br>
(She grabs a cracker from the table and leaves.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is not inside. A woman is.) <br>
CLARA: You can fly the Tardis? <br>
TASHA: Flying the Tardis was always easy. It was flying the Doctor I
never quite mastered. <br>
CLARA: What's happened to him?

in his chair.) <br>
CLARA: Hello, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Were you always so young? <br>
CLARA: Nah, that was you. <br>

CLARA: Hey, it's okay. It's all right, don't worry. <br>
(She helps him make the cracker go bang.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah! Is there a joke? Ha? <br>
(Clara reads the slip of paper.) <br>
CLARA: Extract from Thoughts on a Clock by Eric Ritchie junior. <br>
DOCTOR: Is it a knock knock one? Those are best. <br>
CLARA: I don't think so. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, read it. Go on. <br>
CLARA: And now it's time for one last bow, like all your other selves.
Eleven's hour is over now. The clock is striking twelve's. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't get it. <br>
DALEK [OC]: Doctor! The Doctor will be brought! <br>
(A huge Dalek Mothership hovers over the village.) <br>
DALEK [OC]: The Daleks demand the Doctor. <br>
(A young man runs in.) <br>
YOUNG MAN: They're here. The Daleks, we can't stop them. They want you.
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, all right, Barnable. Are you Barnable? <br>
YOUNG MAN: No, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: It's okay, Barnable, don't worry. I have got a plan. Off you
pop. <br>
(The young man leaves to the sounds of explosions outside.) <br>
DOCTOR: I haven't got a plan, but people love it when I say that. <br>
CLARA: Doctor, what are you going to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. Talk very fast, hope something good happens,
take the credit. That's generally how it works. <br>
CLARA: Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Not this time, though. This is it. <br>
CLARA: No! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. We saw the future, Clara. This is how it ends. <br>
CLARA: Change it. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha. <br>
CLARA: Like Tasha said, change the future. <br>
DOCTOR: I could have once, when there were Time Lords. Not any more.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: No. You're going to stay here. Promise me
you will. <br>
CLARA: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: I'll be keeping you safe. One last victory. Allow me that. Give
me that, my impossible girl. Thank you. And goodbye. <br>
(He wipes away her tears and totters off up the stairs.) <br>
DOCTOR: The trouble with Daleks is, they take so long to say anything.
Probably die of boredom before they shoot me. <br>
DALEK [OC]: The Doctor is required! <br>
(Clara goes to the crack in the wall.) <br>
CLARA: Listen to me, you lot. Listen! Help him. Help him change the
future. Do it. Do something. <br>
DALEK [OC]: Doctor! <br>
CLARA: You've been asking a question, and it's time someone told you
you've been getting it wrong. His name, his name is the Doctor. All the
name he needs. Everything you need to know about him. And if you love
him, and you should, help him. Help him. <br>
(Clara finally turns away, then the crack snaps shut. She runs outside
to join the villagers and the Daleks, who are looking up at the Doctor
in the bell chamber.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Sorry I'm a bit slow. I may not be at my
best right now. <br>
DALEK [OC]: You are dying, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm dying. You've been trying to kill me for centuries,
and here I am, dying of old age. If you want something done, do it
yourself. <br>
DALEK [OC]: You will die, and the Time Lords will never return. <br>
DOCTOR: You still can't work up the courage to shoot me, can you?
You're still worried I've got something up my sleeve. Well, you knock
yourselves out, boys. I've got nothing this time. <br>
(Flying Daleks fire at the troops on the ground, making the townsfolk
scream. Then the crack opens in the sky and
golden regeneration energy enters the Doctor's mouth. His eyes widen in
surprise and his hands begin to glow.) <br>
DALEK [OC]: You will die now, Doctor. This is the end of you. <br>
(The crack disappears.) <br>
DALEK [OC]: The rules of regeneration are known. You have expended all
your lives. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, what did you say? Did you mention the rules? Now,
listen. Bit of advice. Tell me the truth if you think you know it. Lay
down the law if you're feeling brave. But, Daleks, never, ever tell me
the rules! <br>
DALEK [OC]: Emergency! Emergency! The Doctor is regenerating! <br>
(The Tower clock strikes twelve. The Doctor is feeling more youthful
already,
although he doesn't look it.) <br>
DALEK [OC]: The Doctor is regenerating! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, look at this. Regeneration number thirteen. We're breaking
some serious science here, boys. I tell you what, it's going to be a
whopper! <br>
DALEK [OC]: Exterminate! Exterminate the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: You think you can stop me now, Daleks? If you want my life, ha,
ha, come and get it! <br>
(The Doctor winds up his arm and fires a big stream of energy out from
his hand.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CLARA: Get inside! Come on, quickly. Get inside,
quick. <br>
(The Doctor fires of more energy from the other hand as Clara gets the
survivors into the Tower. The burning remains of flying Daleks tumble
to the ground.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Love from Gallifrey, boys! <br>
(Then a final blast from his head up to the Dalek Mothership. Mega
KaBOOM! and the shockwave rips open the remaining Daleks on the ground.
It even rocks the
Tardis as it travels out of the town and through the countryside. Then
silence falls.)
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Later, Clara leads the people out to survey the

CLARA: Doctor? <br>

and replaces it, then goes inside.)
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor's village clothes are scattered on the
floor, and a nearly empty bowl of fish fingers and custard is on the
console. There are footsteps on the stairs. Her bow-tied young Doctor
smiles at her.) <br>
CLARA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Hello. <br>
CLARA: You're young again. You're okay. You didn't even change your
face. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha! It's started. I can't stop it now. This is just the reset.
A whole new regeneration cycle. Ooo. <br>
(He finishes his custard.) <br>
DOCTOR: Taking a bit longer. Just breaking it in. Oh. Oh. Gah. <br>
(He starts the Tardis' engines.) <br>
DOCTOR: It all just disappears, doesn't it? Everything you are, gone in
a moment, like breath on a mirror. Any moment now, he's a-coming. <br>
CLARA: Who's coming? <br>
DOCTOR: The Doctor. <br>
CLARA: But you, you are the Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yep, and I always will be. <br>
(His hands are glowing.) <br>
DOCTOR: But times change, and so must I. <br>
(The Doctor sees a young Amy Pond run up the stairs, laughing.) <br>
DOCTOR: Amelia? <br>
CLARA: Who's Amelia? <br>
DOCTOR: The first face this face saw. We all change, when you think
about it. We're all different people all through our lives. And that's
okay, that's good, you've got to keep moving, so long as you remember
all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this.
Not one day. I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me. <br>
(Then he sees a vision of a red-haired woman with black painted
fingernails walk down the stairs to him.) <br>
AMY: Raggedy man. Good night. <br>
(They touch each others cheeks, and she disappears. The Doctor removes
his bow tie and drops it on the floor. His face is in pain.) <br>
CLARA: No, no. <br>
DOCTOR: Hey <br>
CLARA: Please don't change. <br>
(The Doctor jerks backwards as Matt Smith and then forwards as Peter
Capaldi. Tall, grey haired, piercing blue eyes and a Scottish burr. My
kind of man. The new Doctor and Clara stare into each others eyes, then
he jerks back and forward again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Kidneys! I've got new kidneys. I don't like the colour. <br>
CLARA: Of your kidneys? <br>
(The Tardis starts lurching from side to side.) <br>
CLARA: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: We're probably crashing. Oh! <br>
CLARA: Into what? <br>
DOCTOR: Stay calm. Just one question. Do you happen to know how to fly
this thing?
