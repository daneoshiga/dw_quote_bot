they have passed, two Saracens come out of hiding.) <br>
EL AKIR: No, not yet. One of them may be the King. Follow them and
listen to them. <br>
(The Tardis materialises in the wood) <br>
(Elsewhere, a falconer hoods a hawk.) <br>
RICHARD: We are the only day and night for you, hunter. <br>
DE MARUN: I wish that I were a hawk, sire, and Saladin my prey. <br>
RICHARD: Now there's a subject for our troubadours and actors. Speak to
the Chamberlain about it, I beg you, de Marun. <br>
DE MARUN: I will, my lord. I will have the players call the
entertainment, The Defeat of Saladin, the Sparrow of the East. <br>
RICHARD: Well, it'll help us to pass these weary waiting nights at
Jaffa. Here's a man devoted to his work. <br>
DE TORNEBU: A beautiful thing, sire, but it has a stubborn streak. The
clasp is faulty and needs hot fires to make it pliable. <br>
RICHARD: Perhaps I should ride with craftsmen and leave my knights at
home. <br>
(The man with sword that we saw earlier arrives) <br>
DES PREAUX: Your Majesty. <br>
RICHARD: No, des Preaux, I will not fight today. <br>
DE MARUN: Or do you mean to slay us all? <br>
DE TORNEBU: And eat us for his dinner, from the look of him. <br>
DES PREAUX: Sire, I've heard sounds in these woods. <br>
DE MARUN: I've heard nothing. <br>
DE TORNEBU: What sort of sounds? <br>
RICHARD: Let the man speak! <br>
DES PREAUX: I fear this wood, sire. You are too far from Jaffa and the
Saracens too near. <br>
RICHARD: Have you seen any? <br>
DES PREAUX: No, but I sense them about us. This wood might have been
designed for ambush. <br>
RICHARD: What, des Preaux? Would you see danger in your own shadow? <br>
DE TORNEBU: I have put the brothers de L'Etabe with the horses, sire,
and all is ready for the return to Jaffa. If your Majesty desires to
go. <br>
RICHARD: We will stay here until, William the Wary, you recover your
composure. And, I hope, your sense of humour. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IAN: I'll just take a look around. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. <br>
(Ian encounters an armed Saracen) <br>
IAN: Barbara. <br>
(Someone grabs Barbara from behind.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good afternoon! <br>
(The distraction enables Ian disarm and knock out the Saracen.) <br>
DOCTOR: What is all this? Who is he? How did he attack you? Why did he
attack you? <br>
IAN: I don't know. I didn't stop to ask him. <br>
VICKI: What's going on? Where are we? <br>
Ian: Shh! <br>
(Swordplay can be heard.) <br>
IAN: Sounds to me as if he's got some friends. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. Give me a hand. <br>
VICKI: But who is he? <br>
DOCTOR: Come away, child. Dear me. Out of one trouble into another! <br>
(They hide the unconscious Saracen.) <br>
IAN: Barbara. Where's Barbara? Barbara! <br>
(Barbara has been gagged and is being thoroughly tied up) <br>
IAN [OC]: Barbara! <br>
(The noise of fighting gets closer) <br>
IAN: Someone's coming. Hide. <br>
(The King is wounded. De Tornebu is shot by an arrow so the Doctor and
Vicki haul him into the bushes. Then de
Marun is also shot, allowing the King to fall near Ian.) <br>
DES PREAUX: Saracens, I am the king! I am Malek Ric! <br>
EL AKIR: No. You have no friends to protect you now, Malek Ric. <br>
DES PREAUX: Am I to die as well? If so, dispatch me and have done with
it. <br>
EL AKIR: A king at liberty may give commands. A captured one obeys
them. Take him! Find the others and kill them. <br>
(The Saracens leave except one. Ian lures him away from Richard then
lets a branch spring back into his face. Ian then uses a dropped sword
to fight him) <br>
(The Doctor checks on the wounded and has to fight another Saracen. De
Tornebu saves him by throwing his sword
into the Saracen.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, old chap, I have my friend here to thank for my
life. Are you
all right, dear boy? <br>
IAN: Yes, I'm all right. <br>
DOCTOR: That Saracen very nearly did for me. Of course. Did you hear
what that man
called him? Saracen. Malek Ric! Yes, that was the name the Saracens had
for King Richard, Coeur de Lion. Malek Ric. <br>
VICKI: So we're in the Holy Land? He's trying to say something. What <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, he's got a very bad wound here. <br>
DE TORNEBU: He was not the King. <br>
VICKI: Not the King? <br>
DE TORNEBU: The belt. Get the belt. <br>
VICKI: This belt? <br>
DOCTOR: This belt. Wait a minute. Of course, yes. I remember. This
belongs to his royal master, King Richard. He'll certainly be glad to
get this back again. We should be able to get into his favour. We shall
need some assistance to help find Barbara. <br>
IAN: We can't wait that long, Doctor. I'm going to have another look
for her now. <br>
DOCTOR: Be careful, my boy. <br>
(Barbara is being hauled through the wood) <br>
IAN [OC]: Barbara! Barbara! <br>
(Richard gets up and staggers away) <br>
(Later, Vicki is tending the wounded knight.) <br>
DOCTOR: How is he, my dear? Did he take the drug I gave you? <br>
VICKI: Yes, but I'm afraid he's unconscious again. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, he should be better when we get him back to his own
people. <br>
(Ian enters.) <br>
VICKI: Where have you been? <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right? <br>
VICKI: You've been gone over an hour. <br>
IAN: There's no sign of Barbara anywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, as I said before, we must try and get some help from King
Richard. This certainly belongs to him. <br>
IAN: I suppose you're right, but how are we going to set about it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, at the moment we can do nothing further until I find some
clothes for all of us to wear,
hmm? Yes. Now I think Vicki and I should go down into that city and see
what we can find. Now, here, child. Put on this cloak, and it'll help
to act as a disguise. <br>
IAN: While you're gone, I'll gather some branches and make a stretcher
for him. <br>
DOCTOR: It's a good idea, but be careful. In the meantime, keep your
eye on that. <br>
(He gives Ian the belt.) <br>
IAN: Oh, yeah. <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, child. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Barbara and de Preaux are under heavy guard) <br>
DES PREAUX: I will do you no harm. <br>
BARBARA: Oh. Oh, thank heaven they've taken that gag away. Umm, I'm so
thirsty. <br>
(Des Preaux puts a cloak around her shoulders and gets her a dish of
water.) <br>
DES PREAUX: I do not know who you are, or how you came to be in the
wood outside Jaffa. Your clothing is strange. It has caused some talk. <br>
BARBARA: Thank you for the cloak. Oh, that's better. Where are we? <br>
DES PREAUX: I am told we are at Ramlah. <br>
BARBARA: Ramlah? <br>
DES PREAUX: The great Sultan's encampment. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, I see. What are we doing here? <br>
DES PREAUX: As for you, I can make no guess. But I am King Richard,
Coeur de Lion, leader of the mighty host, scourge of the infidel. <br>
BARBARA: But I thought Richard had red hair. <br>
DES PREAUX: Had? Still has if the ruse has worked. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, then you <br>
DES PREAUX: I am Sir William des Preaux, captured and mistaken for my
King. Some smiles will turn to long faces soon, I have no doubt. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, I heard the sound of fighting in the wood. <br>
DES PREAUX: We were sadly outnumbered and taken by surprise. <br>
BARBARA: What happened to the others in the wood? <br>
DES PREAUX: I do not know. Maybe I shall never know. But I have a
hopeful heart and, which is better, a lucky King. And you, who will not
say her name. <br>
BARBARA: Barbara. <br>
DES PREAUX: Barbara. I would like to know how one so gentle puts
herself among the swords and arrows. And your garments are a fashion in
themselves. <br>
BARBARA: Take me back to that wood, Sir William, and I'll answer all
your questions. <br>
DES PREAUX: You ask for the impossible very lightly. <br>
BARBARA: Is it so impossible? <br>
DES PREAUX: Today it is. But what am I to say of you to the heathen?
How can I explain you to them? <br>
BARBARA: Well, to them you're King Richard, so who would travel with
Richard? <br>
DES PREAUX: The Queen would not, but the Princess Yes, you shall be
Joanna, my sister, and help me in my lies. <br>
BARBARA: Very well. I seem to have gained a brother and a title. <br>
DES PREAUX: And what is more, a friend. <br>
BARBARA: I'm grateful for that. <br>
DES PREAUX: Shh. Remember, you are Joanna. <br>
(El Akir enters.) <br>
EL AKIR: Yusef Salah ed-Din has commanded that all prisoners be treated
with compassion. Would you say I have complied with his wishes? <br>
DES PREAUX: The Sultan of Egypt and Syria would no doubt be pleased.
But this lady, my sister <br>
EL AKIR: Sister? <br>
DES PREAUX: Aye. Joanna, Princess of England and closest to me in
affection. My sister has been ill-treated, handled roughly by your men.
Is this the compassion Saladin speaks of? <br>
EL AKIR: Enough of your babbling. The woman is all of one piece. <br>
DES PREAUX: Woman? Hold your tongue, Saracen! <br>
(The guards restrain des Preaux.) <br>
EL AKIR: We shall call her a prisoner, then. Does that sound better?
You have no rights, no privileges, nothing except the benevolence of
our leader. That you are the King's sister bodes well for me. I can
serve both the Sultan and Malek el Adil. <br>
DES PREAUX: Saphadin? <br>
EL AKIR: As you call the Sultan's brother, yes. He will be pleased to
see the woman he has so long admired. Let him go. He is a lion without
claws. <br>
(El Akir exits.) <br>
BARBARA: Someone is going to have a very red face before long. <br>
DES PREAUX: And an angry temper. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Traders shout out their wares to passers-by.) <br>
DAHEER: Silks. Satins. Fine robes. Rich silks. Satins from Basra. Fine
robes. Silks. Satins. The finest robes in Jaffa! Silks. Satins. Fine
robes. Rich silks. Fine satins. The finest robes in Jaffa. <br>
(The Doctor approaches.) <br>
DAHEER: My lord. You are from Pisa, my lord? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
DAHEER: Genoa, then? <br>
DOCTOR: I know of the place well. <br>
DAHEER: You are very cautious, you traders from Venice. <br>
DOCTOR: I am not a Venetian, neither am I a trader. <br>
DAHEER: Oh, your pardon, my lord. The richness of your cloak is hidden
by the darkness. <br>
DOCTOR: You have some very fine materials here. <br>
DAHEER: The finest on the coast, my lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what they all say. <br>
DAHEER: Please, step into my humble shop. <br>
(The Doctor and Daheer go into the shop as Vicki sneaks up and sits by
the door.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Daheer's shop]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Truly remarkable, all the colours of the
rainbow. Ha, ha! Yes, it's truly Where did you say these wonderful
materials came from? <br>
DAHEER: Basra, my lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Basra? Ah, most interesting. <br>
(An English man enters the shop.) <br>
DAHEER: Forgive me, my lord. Why can't you be more careful when you
come here? Why can't you wait until the place is empty? <br>
(Daheer looks through the bundle of clothes the man has brought him.) <br>
THATCHER: They're all good, fine things. I want more than you paid last
time. <br>
DAHEER: Such clothes as these are difficult for me to sell. <br>
THATCHER: Just give me my money. <br>
DAHEER: I a afraid that I may sell them to the person you took them
from. <br>
THATCHER: A good price, that's all I ask. <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Having been stolen once, they can be stolen again, or
perhaps borrowed, shall we say, hmm? <br>
(The Doctor ducks under a table while Daheer pays his supplier.) <br>
THATCHER: Here, that's not enough. It was dangerous work getting them
things. If I was caught, do you know what would happen?
Do you know the King's punishment for thieves? I'd be shorn like a
prizefighter and boiling pitch poured on me head. And as for you. <br>
(From under the table, the Doctor snaffles a garment.) <br>
DAHEER: You did get out of the palace without being seen? <br>
THATCHER: Of course I did. Remember, I can go elsewhere next time. <br>
DAHEER: And get less. <br>
(The Doctor takes some boots then other garments.) <br>
THATCHER: I couldn't get any less than what you give me. Blimey, it was
hard word getting around the palace. I couldn't have done anything. I
spend all my time trying to get this money and you do nothing. <br>
DAHEER: As you paid nothing for them in the first place, you have done
very well. <br>
THATCHER: Bah! <br>
(Thatcher leaves) <br>
DAHEER: My lord? My lord? I was sure that he would buy from me. I could
have sworn that he hadn't left. <br>
(The Doctor ties a rope around a leg of the next table, then pulls and
makes it collapse.) <br>
DAHEER: No, my beautiful clothes! Oh, they're ruined, all covered in
mud. My silks and satins. My embroidery from India. Oh, I am beset by
devils! Oh! <br>
(The Doctor throws the clothes and boots to Vicki.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my poor friend, what a misfortune. You've had an accident. <br>
DAHEER: Am I not the most miserable of men. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, you are, but I'm afraid I must leave you with your
misfortune. But I shall return. Yes, I will return and you shall not be
the loser by this business. <br>
DAHEER: Oh please do. Please do, my lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. <br>
DAHEER: For what, my lord? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, for being here. For being here when you were most needed.
Yes, yes. Goodbye. <br>
DAHEER: Goodbye, my lord. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye. And long live the Sultan. <br>

EL AKIR: My lord, I bring good fortune. Not only for your ears, but for
he who rules all of us as well. <br>
SAPHADIN: My brother hears you as I do. <br>
EL AKIR: I would see his face when I tell my story. <br>
SAPHADIN: Be content that your voice is heard. If what you have to say
pleases my brother, then you will see him. <br>
(Saladin is sitting behind a curtain.) <br>
EL AKIR: Know then that I, El Akir, have the instrument to vanquish the
invaders from across the seas. <br>
SAPHADIN: Indeed? <br>
EL AKIR: I have taken two prisoners. One of them, the King of the
English, Malek Ric. <br>
SAPHADIN: Malek Ric? If you are speaking the truth. <br>
(El Akir signals his guards to bring in des Preaux) <br>
EL AKIR: The Lion is in our cage. <br>
SAPHADIN: Good fortune indeed, El Akir. <br>
EL AKIR: The other, a priceless stone I bring to lay before you as your
heart desires. The sister of the Malek Ric, here for your command. <br>
(Barbara enters.) <br>
SAPHADIN: Princess Joanna. <br>
EL AKIR: No less. <br>
SAPHADIN: Less then less! Who is this creature? This rowdy jackal that
yaps at my feet with tales of fortune and success? <br>
EL AKIR: My lord. <br>
SAPHADIN: You vile worm. Do you think I do not know the face and the
form of the Princess? You take me for a fool? <br>
EL AKIR: You tricked me! <br>
(Saladin enters.) <br>
SALADIN: Be silent. This is not King Richard. <br>
EL AKIR: Not? <br>
SALADIN: A blacker head of red-gold hair I never saw. You have the
better bargain, brother. She may not be the Princess, but her beauty
lights the room. <br>
EL AKIR: My lord, I swear. <br>
SALADIN: I do not wish to hear you. But I will listen to you. <br>
DES PREAUX: I am William des Preaux, and to aid my King's escape, I
shouted out his name and took his identity. This lady, your Highness,
has no part in this matter but in aiding my pretence, and I beg you to
look upon her kindly, whatever fate you have for me. <br>
SALADIN: I salute your chivalry. All is now clear to me except the
lady's presence. <br>
EL AKIR: Great Sultan, this woman can be made to entertain you. I can
have her dance on hot coals, run a gauntlet of sharp tipped swords. <br>
DES PREAUX: No! <br>
EL AKIR: Die for your pleasure. <br>
SALADIN: What do you say to that? <br>
BARBARA: It sounds like the punishment for a fool. <br>
SALADIN: It does. And who here is the most foolish? El Akir, I can
devise my own pleasures. Go with Sir William. Let me hear you have
treated him like a brother. Let him have all the liberty except liberty
itself. <br>
(des Preaux, El Akir and guards leave.) <br>
SALADIN: Are you afraid of me? <br>
BARBARA: No. <br>
SALADIN: You're not of these lands, yet you seem to be a stranger to
Sir William. <br>
BARBARA: I'm a traveller. I came with three friends. We arrived in the
wood. <br>
SALADIN: You rode into the wood? <br>
BARBARA: No. <br>
SAPHADIN: You walked into it? <br>
BARBARA: Not that either. <br>
SALADIN: You arrived? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. In a box. <br>
SAPHADIN: In a box? Ah, you were carried into the wood. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
SALADIN: Please talk. It helps me to consider what I have to do with
you. <br>
BARBARA: Well, I could say that I'm from another world, a world ruled
by insects. And before that we were in Rome at the time of Nero. Before
that we were in England, far, far into the future. <br>
SALADIN: Now I understand, you and your friends, you are players,
entertainers. <br>
SAPHADIN: With little value in an exchange of prisoners with the
English King, brother. This is a trivial affair. I do not know why you
waste your time. <br>
(Saphadin leaves.) <br>
SALADIN: I cannot dispense life and death lightly. If Sir William is to
be returned, he must make good report of our mercy. Perhaps that is the
factor in your favour. <br>
BARBARA: I don't believe you're as calculating as that. <br>
SALADIN: Then learn more of me. You must serve my purpose or you have
no purpose. Grace my table tonight in more suitable clothes. If your
tales beguile me, you shall stay and entertain. <br>
BARBARA: Like Scheherazade. <br>
SALADIN: Over whose head hung sentence of death.

RICHARD: Right! Enough! This is the Devil's own embrocation. Continue. <br>
DE TORNEBU: And so these kindly people, whose faces were like hidden in
a mist until the moment passed, saved my life and brought me here. <br>
RICHARD: Good friends, indeed. We thank you. The brothers de L'Etable
are dead. de Marun dead. Sir Richard des Preaux taken. What have I left
but one wounded friend and a sore head? <br>
DOCTOR: One small thing remains yours, sire. <br>
(The Doctor hands over the belt.) <br>
RICHARD: Once again, I am in your debt. But I'd give this for de Marun
and the others. My friends cut down about my ears or stolen. My armies
roust about the streets and clutter up the streets of Jaffa with the
garbage of their vices. And now I learn my brother John thirsts after
power, drinking great draughts of it though it's not his to take. He's
planning to usurp my crown, and trade with my enemy, Philip of France.
Trade! A tragedy of fortunes and I am too much beset by them. A curse
on this! A thousand curses! <br>
IAN: We must ask him. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not sure this is the time. <br>
VICKI: No, he doesn't seem in the best of moods, does he? <br>

IAN: Your Majesty. There were four of us in that wood. One of our
companions was a lady.
She <br>
RICHARD: Do not bother me with such things now. <br>
IAN: I am asking you to send me with an escort to Saladin's
headquarters. <br>
RICHARD: And what do you do when you are there? <br>
IAN: Arrange for the release of our friends. <br>
RICHARD: As my emissary to Saladin? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
RICHARD: What, flatter him? Bring him presents in return? <br>
DOCTOR: It would be of little use, a player king and a young woman,
sire. <br>
RICHARD: No. <br>
IAN: I can bring them both back. <br>
RICHARD: No. <br>
IAN: Why not? <br>
RICHARD: Are you deaf? We do not trade with Saladin today. Not today,
nor tomorrow, nor any day henceforth. <br>
DOCTOR: Our young friend is a woman, sire. Have pity. Let us help her. <br>
VICKI: Please, your Majesty. <br>
RICHARD: Understand this. This woman can rot in one of Saladin's
prisons until her hair turns white before I'll trade with the man that
killed my friends!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DE TORNEBU: My lord, although we left a little of
our pride back in the woods, there is some capital to be gained from
the affair. Beside the violence and the tragedy, it has a humour. <br>
RICHARD: Humour? Is he delirious? <br>
DOCTOR: I think I know what he means, sire. Here Saladin, mighty ruler
and commander of huge armies, believes he's captured you. <br>
VICKI: You could turn this into a good story against Saladin. <br>
DE TORNEBU: Look on the brighter side, my lord. A troop of men to
capture one of your knights? Why, he'd need an army by itself and more
to take your horse, or every man he has or more to take you prisoner. <br>
DOCTOR: You could spread this tale by word of mouth and all the world
would know that Saladin fears you. <br>
VICKI: Sire, if you send to him and asked if he'd finished playing his
game and could you have your knight back, it'll make him look such a
fool. <br>
RICHARD: There is a jest here, albeit a grim one with our friends dead.
But Saladin must be just as much out of temper over this affair as we
are. <br>
DOCTOR: Your messenger might offer to exchange a hundred prisoners for
the knight he holds. <br>
RICHARD: We think we value Sir William highly. We do, but it would not
be good to let Saladin know. <br>
DOCTOR: He might think you undervalue his men. One hundred men to one
of yours. Methinks a fair bargain, sire. <br>
RICHARD: By my father's name, you have wit, old man. Guard, call the
Chamberlain. We recognise the service you have rendered us and will be
pleased to see you in our court. <br>

places for these others. They have our patronage. <br>
CHAMBERLAIN: Thatcher, guard, lend a hand. <br>
VICKI: Be careful. Mind his shoulder. <br>
IAN: We should carry him. <br>
VICKI: Shall I help? <br>
IAN: No, I think we can manage. <br>
JOANNA: This is a young man? <br>
DOCTOR: His voice has not yet broken, your Highness. <br>
JOANNA: What is your name? <br>
VICKI: Victor. <br>
JOANNA: Do you sing songs or play an instrument? <br>

RICHARD: Saladin? <br>
JOANNA: His brother, Saphadin. Oh, I have given no cause for his
attention. <br>
RICHARD: Saladin sends me presents of fruit and snow when I am sick,
and now his brother decorates you with his jewels. Yet with our armies
do we both lock in deadly combat, watering the land with a rain of
blood, and the noise of thunder is drowned in the shouts of dying men. <br>
JOANNA: Your heart calls for England, Richard. <br>
RICHARD: Aye, it does. <br>
JOANNA: Is there no kind of peace with Saladin? <br>
RICHARD: All wise men look for peace. The terms of peace make wise men
look fools. I would have Ascalon, but Saladin fears that if he gives me
that town then I will invade Egypt, and nothing I can say can make him
change his mind. How this jewel radiates the light. So, Saphadin
desires my sister. <br>

possibly match those you already own? But I'm travelled from Tyre to
speak with Saladin at Ramlah, a weary journey, and neither he nor his

EL AKIR: It's nothing to me. I'm leaving Ramlah. <br>

EL AKIR: And what is your reason, merchant? <br>
LUIGI: Conrad of Tyre has sent an emissary here to make a treaty with
your overlord. I come on his heels. Where there is a treaty there is a
chance of profit. What lies unwanted on my ships at Tyre will find a
home in Saladin. And from him I can buy and stock my ships again. <br>
EL AKIR: And what is my part in this, merchant? <br>
LUIGI: Arrange an audience with Saladin or his brother. But how will I
repay such a favour? <br>
EL AKIR: There is a woman here, an English woman. She made me look a
fool. I shall take her to my palace at Lydda and then we shall see who
the fool is, or the master. <br>
LUIGI: A simple matter. Arrange my audience, then wait by the stables.

plan? A victory like Arsuf? <br>
RICHARD: Not this time, no, my lord of Leicester. No, we've had another
thought. To give our sister's hand in marriage to Saphadin, brother of
the Sultan, and so make an end to this war. <br>
DOCTOR: I am indeed glad. sir, to know that you are thinking in terms
of peace. <br>
LEICESTER: The princess to marry Saphadin? My lord, I beg you to
explain. <br>
RICHARD: We do not feel obliged to explain anything to anyone, my lord
of Leicester. We think our words were plain enough. <br>
DOCTOR: It is a good scheme, sire, if the princess agrees. <br>
RICHARD: Joanna knows nothing of this matter. <br>
DOCTOR: Will she agree?&nbsp;<br>
RICHARD: You should rather ask how can she refuse? To stem the blood,
bind up the wounds and give a host of men lives and futures? Oh, now
there's a marriage contract to put sacrifice to shame and make a saint
of any woman. <br>
LEICESTER: Sire, with all the strength at my command I urge you, sire,
to abandon this pretence of peace. <br>
DOCTOR: Pretence, sir? Here's an opportunity to save the lives of many
men and you do
naught but turn it down without any kind of thought. What do you think
you are doing? <br>
LEICESTER: I speak as a soldier. Why are we here in this foreign land
if not to fight? The Devil's horde, Saracen and Turk, posses Jerusalem
and we will not wrest it from them with honeyed words. <br>
DOCTOR: With swords, I suppose? <br>
LEICESTER: Aye, with swords and lances, or the axe. <br>
DOCTOR: You stupid butcher! Can you think of nothing else but killing,
hmm? <br>
LEICESTER: You're a man for talk, I can see that. You like a table and
a ring of men. A parley here, arrangements there, but when you men of
eloquence have stunned each other with your words, we, we the soldiers,
have to face it out. On some half-started morning while you speakers
lie abed, armies settle everything, giving sweat, sinewed bodies, aye,
and life itself. <br>
DOCTOR: I admire bravery and loyalty, sir. You have both of these. But,
unfortunately you haven't any brain at all. I hate fools. <br>
LEICESTER: A fool can match a coward any day. <br>
RICHARD: Enough of this! You dare to flourish arms before your King?
Know this, my lord of Leicester. We will not be advised. We have
decided on a pact with Saladin. If that fails, then a trial of arms.

forward. </font></p>

title to much land. Power over far off
countries. A glittering empire, brother! <br>

SAPHADIN: Of course. <br>
SALADIN: Of course. Do not look so troubled. I will humour you and let
this proposition go ahead. But listen to me well. Strategy is worth a
hundred lances. Think brother, how does this proposed marriage help us
to win our future battles? <br>
SAPHADIN: You do not mean to think of this alliance seriously. <br>
SALADIN: If you can marry with this sister of the English King then do
so and I will help you to it. Go, write a letter. Say the idea pleases
both of us. <br>
SAPHADIN: But yet you doubt it. <br>
SALADIN: Have England, France and all the rest come here to cheer a man

weary man. So you write your letter and I'll alert the armies. Then on
either day, the day of blissful union or the day of awful battle, we
will be prepared. <br>
SAPHADIN: You are wise. I was wrong to doubt you. <br>
SALADIN: Hold one hand out in friendship but keep the other on your
sword. <br>
SAPHADIN: The knight, Sir Ian of Jaffa, who brought a plea for the
release of Sir William. <br>
SALADIN: Sir William I cannot return. Not yet. But write that he is
well cared for. As for the other, Sir Ian, he begged to be allowed to
search for the lady Barbara. The brave deserve their favours. Go,
brother, write your letter. This sincerity deserves our honest

IBRAHIM: El Akir will kill you. He's a very, very bad man. <br>
IAN: He's not the only one around here. Why do you say he's a bad man? <br>
IBRAHIM: He has made the rich people so poor so there is no one left to
steal from. If you rid the world of him, you will be remembered as a
saviour. I shall not betray you. <br>
IAN: Oh, well in that case, perhaps you can do something for me. <br>
IBRAHIM: Anything, my lord, anything, anything. <br>
IAN: Yes, on second thoughts, it might be a little difficult for you. I
wonder, do you think you could manage to, er, steal some horses for me?
<br>
IBRAHIM: Now you are truly, truly my brother. While you keep El Akir
occupied, I will steal the horses from his stables. <br>
IAN: Good. <br>
IBRAHIM: You can always trust Ibrahim. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAIMUNA: Fatima has betrayed us. You must get away.
You will die if you stay here. <br>
EL AKIR: You hid her from me! <br>
BARBARA: Leave her alone! <br>
EL AKIR: Now I shall show you how I deal with those who do not obey me!
<br>
(As El Akir raises his sword against Maimuna, he is stabbed in the
back.) <br>
MAIMUNA: Father! Oh, father! I believed you were dead. <br>
HAROUN: There is great joy in my heart at seeing you. But come now.
Your sister
Safiya awaits you. <br>
BARBARA: Is Safiya alright? <br>
HAROUN: Yes. She told me of your sacrifice. I came here to give my life
for you, my lady. <br>
BARBARA: How did you get in here? <br>
(Fatima enters and screams followed by Ian) <br>
IAN: Barbara! <br>
HAROUN: Get back! The guard! <br>
(Haroun and Ian overpower a guard who rushes in.) <br>
HAROUN: Quickly! Make haste. We must not stay here. <br>
IAN: Barbara, quickly. <br>
(Ian and Barbara leave. The other women gather around Fatima.) <br>
FATIMA: No! No! No! No!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IBRAHIM: You see? I was right, my lord. You did
have gold. <br>
IAN: I acquired it. <br>
IBRAHIM: Like I acquired the horses. <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
IBRAHIM: Now you are my truly, truly brother. <br>
BARBARA: Ian, we must get back to the ship. <br>
IAN: Yes, alright. Farewell, Ibrahim. Don't go acquiring too many
things. <br>
HAROUN: Ride well, my brother. May Allah go with you. <br>
(Ian and Barbara ride off.) <br>
IBRAHIM: Really, such talent. He has such an honest face. We could have
made a fortune. <br>
HAROUN: We must not stand here dreaming, you half-wit. The soldiers
will be around us. <br>
IBRAHIM: This half-wit has stolen all their horses. <br>
HAROUN: They can still use their legs, can't they? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Night sounds, owls and crickets. Richard's
soldiers stand guard between Vicki and the Doctor, and the Tardis a
little way away.) <br>
DOCTOR: They're between us and the ship. <br>
VICKI: Are these the soldiers who followed us? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, they are. I wonder what they're up to? <br>
VICKI: Can we go round? <br>
DOCTOR: No, there's too many of them. Perhaps we can try? No, we can't
do that. <br>
VICKI: Why not? What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: Now I know why we've been followed. <br>
LEICESTER: Your messenger arrived. So they are traitors and making
toward Saladin's encampment. <br>
SOLDIER: So it seemed to me, my lord. <br>
LEICESTER: Armed as they are with secrets, they are dangerous enemies.
Do you have the wood encircled? <br>
SOLDIER: Yes. They can't get away. <br>
LEICESTER: The shadows are the only friends they have. We'll find them
at daybreak. <br>
DOCTOR: It's that meddling fool, Leicester. We've got to try and slip
through them. Remember, not a sound. Not a sound. In you go. <br>
(Vicki gets to the Tardis.) <br>
SOLDIER: Hold! Hold! <br>
DOCTOR: Take your hands off me, sir! What are you doing? Unhand me! How
dare you! <br>
(Vicki and Barbara are outside the Tardis) <br>
VICKI: They've caught him! They've caught him! <br>
BARBARA: Vicki, it's all right. We'll get him away. <br>
VICKI: But how? What can we do? <br>
LEICESTER: So, I thought you'd show yourself. <br>
DOCTOR: What is the meaning of this, sir? The King gave me leave to go.
<br>
LEICESTER: To Saladin? <br>
IAN: You are right, my lord. His treachery is well-paid by Saladin. He
is a Saracen spy. <br>
LEICESTER: The truth at last. But I do not know you, sir. <br>
IAN: I am Sir Ian, my lord, Knight of Jaffa. I know this villain's
treachery, and hearing that you were looking for him, I followed you. <br>
LEICESTER: To watch his execution? <br>
IAN: No, my lord. To administer it. <br>
LEICESTER: It is a paltry matter to be rid of him, but I would do it. <br>
IAN: It is no paltry matter to me, my lord. Some friends of mind were
ambushed here. De Marun, de Tornebu. He's to blame. My lord, I beg of
you, let me finish him. <br>
LEICESTER: Yours is the greater claim. Dispatch him then, and quickly. <br>
DOCTOR: Gentlemen, since I am to depart so punctiliously, I would ask
you to grant me one last wish. <br>
LEICESTER: Granted. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. I would like to look once more upon the city of
Jaffa. Then you may do what you will with me. <br>
LEICESTER: Granted. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you, my lord. <br>
IAN: My lord. <br>
(and they walk away from Leicester to the Tardis) <br>
IAN: Hurry, Doctor, hurry! <br>
DOCTOR: What about that performance? <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, open the door! <br>
(They all enter the Tardis) <br>
SOLDIER: Shh! Do you hear a voice? <br>
LEICESTER: A voice? <br>
SOLDIER: A woman's voice. <br>
LEICESTER: Have we been tricked? <br>
(They get to the Tardis as it dematerialises. They cross themselves in
fear.) <br>
LEICESTER: We will not speak of this. Let this story die here in this
wood or we'll be branded idiots, or liars. Poor Sir Ian, brave fellow.
Spirited away by fiends. What dreadful anguish and despair he must be
suffering now. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IAN: Any more cracks about knighthood, and I'll
carry out that execution. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my dear boy, I must say I think you've earned a good
knight's sleep. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, I suppose, the Tardis will materialise when it's ready. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, and where it likes. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear young woman, why don't you go have a cup of tea or
something. <br>
(The Tardis goes dark except for the control column.) <br>
IAN: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know.<br>
