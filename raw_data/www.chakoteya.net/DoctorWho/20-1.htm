moves crystal blocks around in a control panel. The negative image of a
masked figure on a throne appears.) <br>
OMEGA: You have made your choice? <br>
TIME LORD: Yes. We are ready to begin. <br>
OMEGA: Excellent. And your choice? <br>
TIME LORD: It has not been easy, but time, present location,
personality, for these and other reasons, it must be the Doctor. <br>
OMEGA: The Doctor? Yes. Clever. Most ingenious. The perfect choice,
Time Lord. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Computer room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (In a room in the Citadel, red light flashes on a
console. A Gallifreyan in cream and brown gown answers it.) <br>
DAMON: The security circuit. Cut the scrambler. <br>
(His companion in a plain brown gown obeys. Damon takes a unit from the
console.) <br>
DAMON: That's odd. Photon cell burnout? <br>
(He puts in a new unit.) <br>
TALOR: Okay? <br>
DAMON: Yes. <br>
(Rows of characters scroll up a monitor.) <br>
DAMON: I don't believe this. Talor, look. <br>
TALOR: What is it? <br>
DAMON: Someone's transmitting the biodata extract of one of the Time
Lords. <br>
TALOR: Cut it! This is treason. I must report it at once. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor takes a component from behind a
roundel.) <br>
DOCTOR: And such a simple repair job. <br>
(Nyssa hands him a tool to repair it with.) <br>
NYSSA: Why didn't you do it sooner? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you know how it is. You put things off for a day, next
thing you know it's a hundred years later. <br>
NYSSA: It'll make quite a difference to have audio link-up on the
scanner again. <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>
(He puts back the mended unit and replaces the roundel.) <br>
DOCTOR: Let's see if it works. </font></p>

telephone kiosk where his Australian friend is making a call.) <br>
FRAZER: No, everywhere is full. You got to sleep rough tonight. Yeah,
the hostel from tomorrow. That's the number I gave you. Look, I'd
better go. I'll see you at the airport tomorrow. Take care. <br>
STUART: Okay? Oh no, a policeman. <br>
FRAZER: Steady. The Dutch are a very civilised race. They don't put
people into prison for losing a passport. <br>
STUART: No, but they can deport you. <br>
FRAZER: Oh, come on, let's grab something to eat. Anyway, our real
worry is where we're going to sleep tonight. <br>
STUART: I know a place. Not the most appealing, but central and very
cheap. <br>
FRAZER: Sounds perfect. <br>
STUART: And literally as quiet as the grave. <br>
(They walk off down the street.) </font></p>

DOCTOR: Perfect. <br>
NYSSA: We have an audio system, but nothing to listen to. <br>
DOCTOR: And now we have nothing to look at. Couldn't be better. Peace
and quiet is just what the doctor ordered. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor? There are many other repairs to do. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's nothing urgent, is there? <br>
NYSSA: The navigational system? That must be faulty. We never seem to
arrive where we intend. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Well, you see, ever since the Cybermen damaged the console <br>
NYSSA: And that's another thing. The Tardis used to be in a state of
temporal grace, you said. Guns couldn't be fired. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, nobody's perfect. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> OMEGA: The data has been received, Time Lord, but
not the booster element. Why? <br>
TIME LORD: I had to close down transmission. A fault developed. <br>
OMEGA: What will you do? <br>
TIME LORD: Check to see it wasn't detected. <br>
OMEGA: And if it were? <br>
TIME LORD: I'll deal with it. Perhaps we should delay until I have. <br>
OMEGA: It is too late. Already the Tardis is under my control. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Sensors show we're converging with a
massive source of magnetic radiation. <br>
NYSSA: But there's nothing out there. Just light years of black empty
space. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, something's causing it. We must change course. <br>
NYSSA: To where? <br>
DOCTOR: Anywhere, so as long as it's away from here. </font></p>

points to a large property set back from the road.) <br>

ornamental fountain.) <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Robin leads Colin down a flight of steps below
the fountain.) <br>
FRAZER: What is this place? It's so dark. <br>
STUART: Here, take this. (a torch) Trust me, Colin. Have I ever lead
you astray? <br>
FRAZER: There's always a first time. Who owns this place? <br>
STUART: The state. It's a kind of forgotten national treasure. No one
ever comes here except the odd gardener during the day. <br>
(They walk on through the chapel.) <br>
FRAZER: Wait a minute. This is a crypt! <br>
STUART: So? <br>
FRAZER: I thought you said this was a cellar. <br>
STUART: Didn't you see the ornamentation? The fountain? <br>
FRAZER: Are you serious about staying the night here? <br>
STUART: Of course. <br>
FRAZER: Now I know you're crazy. <br>
STUART: Come on. Our nest's through here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Pump room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STUART: Not quite the Ritz, but it's dry and warm.
<br>
FRAZER: What's in the pipes? <br>
STUART: Water. We're below sea level here. Stop the pumps and Amsterdam
would take up its stilts and float. How'd you like it? <br>
(Robin unrolls his sleeping bag.) <br>
FRAZER: Well, I'm not too keen on the neighbours. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Talor returns.) <br>
DAMON: The analysis checks out. <br>
TALOR: You're sure? <br>
DAMON: Yes, it's the Doctor's biodata extract. What did the Castellan
have to say? <br>
TALOR: In spite of the urgency of my request, he chooses not to be
available until tomorrow. <br>
DAMON: You realise only members of the High Council could have
transmitted that data? <br>
TALOR: I know. We just have to wait. <br>
DAMON: Do you need me any more? <br>
TALOR: No. Good night. <br>
DAMON: Good night. <br>
(After Damon has left, the shadow of a member of the High Council falls
across the door. He enters.) <br>
TALOR: Good evening. <br>
(A weapon is aimed at Talor.) <br>
TALOR: Impulse laser? <br>
(Talor is shot in the head. He falls. The mystery Time Lord then shorts
out a console.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Colin lays out his sleeping bag and gets into it
fully clothed.) <br>
STUART: Are you really going to sleep like that? <br>
FRAZER: What's the matter with that? <br>
STUART: You're still fully dressed. <br>
FRAZER: I'm not taking any chances. <br>
STUART: Oh, come on. It's only a pump house. The worst that can happen
is that we're caught by the police. <br>
FRAZER: I find this place spooky. <br>
STUART: At least take your boots off. <br>
(Colin does.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Gallifrey]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The image of Omega is summoned again.) <br>
TIME LORD: As I feared, transmission was detected, but it has been
dealt with. <br>
OMEGA: How? <br>
TIME LORD: An accident has been arranged. <br>
OMEGA: Bonding can take place immediately? <br>
TIME LORD: As long as you are positive there is no other way. <br>
OMEGA: I am not of your dimension, Time Lord. I have the means to
enter, but without the physical imprint of bonding, I cannot remain
among you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>

NYSSA: Can't you override the control? <br>
DOCTOR: I just tried. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor! <br>
(A bright red dot is zooming across the scanner.) <br>
NYSSA: What is it? <br>
DOCTOR: Something's coming through. <br>
NYSSA: A materialisation? <br>
DOCTOR: No, extradimensional. <br>
(The dot heads for the Tardis and the walls start to warp.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quick, Nyssa, out of here! <br>
(Time slows as they run for the interior door and the now large red
globe enters the console room. It turns into the effect we saw just
before Omega appeared on Gallifrey.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis corridor]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Doctor and Nyssa slow to a halt. The Doctor
turns around to see Omega, who then glides inside him.) <br>

and the sound of a Tardis materialising.) <br>
FRAZER: Robin! Come on, wake up. There's something going on inside. <br>
STUART: What? <br>
FRAZER: There's somebody in there. <br>
STUART: You're imagining it. Go to sleep. <br>
FRAZER: I tell you I heard something. <br>
STUART: You sort it out. I want to sleep. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The torch light picks up a large stone monument.)
<br>
FRAZER: That wasn't here before. <br>
(The front of the monument slides up, and light spills out along with
some dry ice. A skeletal bird-like figure emerges from the light. It
fires a beam at Colin, who flashes negative and positive a few times,
and vanishes with a cry of pain. The weird bird returns to whence it
came.) </font></p>

NYSSA: Doctor? Oh, thank goodness you're all right. <br>
DOCTOR: How long have I been here? <br>
NYSSA: Not long. What was that thing? It just appeared from nowhere. <br>
DOCTOR: From another dimension. <br>
NYSSA: Has it gone? <br>
DOCTOR: From the Tardis, yes. <br>
NYSSA: For a moment I thought it had taken you over. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, for a moment it did. What you saw was an attempted
temporal bonding. The molecular realignment of two basically
incompatible lifeforms. <br>
NYSSA: I checked the sensors. This creature is formed from anti-matter.
<br>
DOCTOR: Are you sure? Then it's worse than I feared. <br>
NYSSA: But the creature failed. It's not in our dimension now. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it is somewhere, and halfway to achieving its purpose. It
won't have given up that easily. <br>
NYSSA: To remain in this universe, the creature would have to reverse
its polarity. I mean, if it failed <br>
DOCTOR: Matter and anti-matter in collision. Yes, I take your point.
Come on, we've got work to do. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Pump room]</b> </font></p>

into -) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> STUART: Colin? Okay, very funny. Now cut it out. <br>
(His torch beam falls on the monument cum Tardis. It's door slides
upwards again and the creature comes out. Robin ducks and runs back
into the pump room as its weapon disintegrates a stone angel. Quickly,
he finds the back way out.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Four Time Lords sit on two rows of chairs whilst
a fifth is on a separate throne. The Matrix circlet rises from his
head. A man in scarlet speaks.) <br>
ZORAC: Well, Lord President? <br>
BORUSA: The Matrix confirms what we already know, Cardinal Zorac. The
creature is intelligent, immensely powerful, and formed from
antimatter. <br>
ZORAC: Damnable business. Thalia, you're the expert on this, what do
you have to say? <br>
(The Time Lady replies. Every one say Hi! to Elspeth Gray.) <br>
THALIA: Well, in theory, movement between dimensions is possible. In
practice, less so. But the same was said about time travel, and that
has long been a reality. <br>
HEDIN: Has the Matrix fixed the location of the creature? <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to the redoubtable Michael Gough.) <br>
BORUSA: It can't. Temporal distortion is extremely severe. <br>
THALIA: At present the creature is shielded, but that will soon decay. <br>
ZORAC: Then we shall know precisely where the creature is. <br>
CASTELLAN: But that will be too late, unless the bond was severed. <br>
THALIA: That, of course, is another matter. But we all know what that
would mean for the Doctor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor is looking up an entry in the Tardis
data-bank.) <br>
NYSSA: (reads) Rondel, intergalactic region devoid of all stellar
activity. In former times the location of collapsed Q star. <br>
(The rest of the entry is - Colloquial name for area, Arc of Infinity.
Derivation of name unknown. Star chart reference 9z63.72.C2. See Quad
Magnetism, Laws Relating to Anti-matter.) <br>
NYSSA: Q star? <br>
DOCTOR: They're very rare. On burnout it creates quardal magnetism.
That's what the sensors picked up. It's the only force known to shield
anti-matter. <br>
NYSSA: That's what's shielding the creature? <br>
DOCTOR: Has to be. But it's known to decay rapidly. Anything else? <br>
NYSSA: Not much. Just the name the ancients gave to this region. The
Arc of Infinity. <br>
DOCTOR: That's it, Nyssa. That's how it came through. What we saw was
the gateway to the dimensions. The Arc of Infinity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> OMEGA: The bonding registered in the Matrix? <br>
TIME LORD: Very clearly. <br>
OMEGA: And the High Council? <br>
TIME LORD: They had no choice but to act as we predicted. But you, I
detect a weakness. <br>
OMEGA: My concern, Time Lord, not yours. Carry out your instructions
and all will be well. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NYSSA: So, if this creature can't bond with you,
it can have no real existence in this universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
NYSSA: But to do that, it would have to have detailed biological
information about you. <br>
DOCTOR: Which in my case exists only in the Matrix on Gallifrey. <br>
NYSSA: So someone there passed it on. </font></p>

Frankendael House in the cold light of day, on Gallifrey a group of
guards enter, led by a man carrying a helmet surmounted by purple and
blue plumes under his arm. Everyone say Hi! to future Doctor Colin
Baker.) <br>
MAXIL: Feed this into the Matrix. Well, don't you recognise the Lord
President's seal? <br>
DAMON: I will need to confirm your authorisation. <br>
MAXIL: Arrest him. <br>
DAMON: Please, please. Well, perhaps I spoke in haste, but to recall a
Tardis, and without prior announcement, well, you must understand my
position. <br>
MAXIL: It's not without due and proper consideration that this decision
has been made. <br>
DAMON: Where do you want the Tardis located? <br>
MAXIL: The security compound. And only I am to have access. Tell my men
when the Tardis arrives. They'll be waiting outside. <br>
(Maxil and his guards leave. Damon puts the embossed gold plaque onto a
red device and presses buttons.) </font></p>

DOCTOR: Hmm. This creature controls the shift of the Arc. Just think of
it, Nyssa. With such power you can unlock the door to travel between
the dimensions of matter and anti-matter. <br>
(An alarm sounds and a hexagonal light on the console flashes.) <br>
NYSSA: Doctor, we've changed course. <br>
DOCTOR: High Council of Time Lords. We're being taken back to
Gallifrey. <br>
NYSSA: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. It must be urgent. Only twice before in our
history has the recall circuit been used. </font></p>

NYSSA: Why are we locked in? Surely the Time Lords have brought you
back to help find the creature and prevent its bonding with you. <br>
DOCTOR: I wish I could believe that. <br>
NYSSA: What other reason would there be? <br>
DOCTOR: It won't be that easy to track this creature down. The universe
is rather a big place. And there is an easier alternative. <br>
NYSSA: To kill you? Is that why they've brought you back? <br>
DOCTOR: Possibly. <br>
(In the records room, Damon watches and hears all the conversation. He

backs away. Another guard steps out behind him and Nyssa pushes him
over.) <br>

have been invaded by a creature from the anti-matter world. We know its
composition and how unstable is the magnetism that shields it. The
creature must be expelled immediately if we are to avert disaster. <br>
DOCTOR: Without knowing its purpose here. <br>
BORUSA: Its presence here must be our first concern. Anti-matter cannot
co-exist in harmony in our universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Lord President, this creature is here now because it bonded
with me. To do so it needed something very special, full and precise
details of my biological makeup. Now, I didn't pass this information
on. Somebody did. The question is who. <br>
CASTELLAN: We considered this, Doctor, but the implications are quite
preposterous. <br>
DOCTOR: Chancellor, can bonding occur without the full imprint of a
so-called bioscan? <br>
THALIA: Not to my knowledge. But the power of this creature is outside
the limits of what we know, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Lord President, I ask for time to have this fully investigated.

BORUSA: I'm sorry, Doctor, but we must deal with the situation as it
exists now. The time factor involved leaves only one course of action
open to us. Commander! <br>

BORUSA: You know that capital punishment has long been abolished here
in Gallifrey, but there is a precedent for a situation like this. Have
you nothing further to say, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I have a great deal to say. <br>
NYSSA: You can't do this! You must destroy the creature. <br>
BORUSA: Child, do you think we have not considered this? The creature
is shielded. We have no way of tracing it. <br>
NYSSA: So you're prepared to kill the Doctor? <br>
BORUSA: Commander! Remove the Doctor to the security compound. As soon
as the warrant is issued, you will convey him to a place of

the first and greatest of our people. The one who sacrificed all to
give us mastery of time and was shamefully abandoned in return. <br>

HEDIN: Yes, Omega. <br>
DOCTOR: But Omega died. <br>
HEDIN: No, he exists, Doctor. He only wants to live amongst us, and he
will, as soon as he transfers here. <br>

were sentenced to death. This time sentence will be carried out. <br>
HEDIN: No! <br>

dead.) <br>

NYSSA: Is Omega dead? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he seemed to die before, yet he returned to confound us
all. <br>
TEGAN: Well, you'll be pleased to hear Colin will be out of hospital in
a couple of days and on his way home to Brisbane. <br>
DOCTOR: Excellent. <br>
NYSSA: And what about you? <br>
TEGAN: Oh, indestructible. I'm fine. <br>
DOCTOR: It's been marvellous to see you again. <br>
NYSSA: Indeed. I've missed you. I wish you didn't have to go back to
your job. <br>
TEGAN: What job? Didn't I tell you? I got the sack. So you're stuck
with me, aren't you. <br>
DOCTOR: So it seems. </font> </p>
