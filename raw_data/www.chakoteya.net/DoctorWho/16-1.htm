his personal mobile gun platform and computer. He blows a dog whistle
and it lifts its head.) <br>
K9: Master? <br>
DOCTOR: It works, K9. It works. Listen, I've got a little surprise for
you. <br>
K9: Master? <br>
DOCTOR: You and I are going away on holiday. <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: A nice, long holiday. <br>
K9: Affirmative. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you like that, K9? <br>
K9: Affirmative, affirmative, affirmative <br>
DOCTOR: Shush. Halergan Three's lovely, K9. You'll really like it.
Beaches, palm trees, sunshine all day. Hot and <br>
(The Tardis goes completely dark. Then the main doors start to open and
golden light floods in to organ accompaniment.) <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Your presence is required. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, listen, I, I, I don't wish to appear rude, but who are
you? <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Do you really need to ask, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, only a guardian could <br>
(A rumble of thunder echoes.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, in that case, sir. <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: You will come to no harm. <br>
DOCTOR: Just as you say. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Guardian's abode]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Wind chimes sound in the flat area with a white
rocks as a backdrop and a few small plants around. A wicker peacock
chair stands under a sunshade next to a small table carrying a decanter
and glasses. A man in a white suit with a red carnation in the lapel
fades into view, seated on the chair.) <br>
GUARDIAN: Doctor, you have been chosen for a vitally important task. <br>
DOCTOR: That's very flattering, sir. <br>
GUARDIAN: It concerns the Key to Time. You know of the Key to Time? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I've heard a few stories. Old legends, myths, that sort
of thing. <br>
GUARDIAN: It is no myth. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, sir. <br>
GUARDIAN: The Key to Time is a perfect cube, which maintains the
equilibrium of time itself. <br>
(A holographic image of a spinning cube appears for illustration, then
fades away.) <br>
GUARDIAN: It consists of six segments, and these segments are scattered
and hidden throughout the cosmos. When they are assembled into the
cube, they create a power which is too dangerous for any being to
possess. <br>
DOCTOR: Well hidden then, I hope, sir. <br>
GUARDIAN: There are times, Doctor, when the forces within the universe
upset the balance to such an extent that it becomes necessary to stop
everything. <br>
DOCTOR: Stop everything? <br>
GUARDIAN: For a brief moment only. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
GUARDIAN: Until the balance is restored. Such a moment is rapidly
approaching. These segments must be traced and returned to me before it
is too late, before the Universe is plunged into eternal chaos. <br>
DOCTOR: Eternal chaos? <br>
GUARDIAN: Eternal as you understand the term. <br>
DOCTOR: Look, I'm sure there must be plenty of other Time Lords who'd
be delighted to <br>
GUARDIAN: I have chosen you. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I was afraid you'd say something like that. Ah! You want
me to volunteer, isn't that it? <br>
GUARDIAN: Precisely. <br>
DOCTOR: And if I don't? <br>
GUARDIAN: Nothing. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing? You mean nothing will happen to me? <br>
GUARDIAN: Nothing at all. Ever. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. What do they look like, these segments? How will I know
them? <br>
GUARDIAN: They're all disguised. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought they might be. <br>
GUARDIAN: They contain the elemental force of the universe. They can be
in any shape, form or size. <br>
DOCTOR: Then how will I recognise them? <br>
GUARDIAN: You will be given a locator. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
GUARDIAN: And an assistant. <br>
DOCTOR: An assistant? Please, sir, on an assignment like this, I'd much
rather work alone. In my experience, assistants mean trouble. I have to
protect them and show them and teach them and couldn't I just, couldn't
I just manage with K9? <br>
GUARDIAN: K9 is a mere machine. <br>
DOCTOR: He is a very sensitive machine! Sorry, sir. <br>
GUARDIAN: You will find your assistant waiting for you in the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well, sir. If you insist. <br>
GUARDIAN: One final thing, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
GUARDIAN: I am the White Guardian. In order to maintain the universal
balance, there is also a Black Guardian, and he also requires the Key
to Time, but for a different purpose. An evil purpose. He must not get
it. Doctor, at all costs, you must prevent that. <br>
DOCTOR: How am I to prevent that? <br>
GUARDIAN: Beware the Black Guardian. <br>
DOCTOR: Beware the Black Guardian. <br>
GUARDIAN: Beware. Beware. <br>
(The Guardian picks up his glass of green wine and fades away.)

ROMANA [OC]: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) That's the new assistant. <br>
(Tall, brunette, statuesque, aloof, wearing a floorlength white dress
fastened only at the waist, and her hair held up by a tiara. Everyone
welcome <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0848693/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mary Tamm</a>)
<br>
ROMANA: My name is Romanadvoratnelundar. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry about that. Is there anything we can do? <br>
ROMANA: The President of the Supreme Council sent me. <br>
(That should be the Doctor, but he's forgotten all about the last
story.) <br>
ROMANA: I was told to give you this. <br>
(Romana hands over a rod.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's this? <br>
ROMANA: According to my instructions, it's the core to the Key of Time.
<br>
DOCTOR: Ah. <br>
ROMANA: Very exciting, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose it must be for someone as young and
inexperienced as you are. <br>
ROMANA: I may be inexperienced, but I did graduate from the Academy
with a triple first. <br>
DOCTOR: I suppose you think we should be impressed by that, too? <br>
ROMANA: Well, it's better than scraping through with fifty one percent
at the second attempt. <br>
DOCTOR: That information is confidential! That President. I should have
thrown him to the Sontarans when I had the chance. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, do you want to know how that works? <br>
DOCTOR: I know how it works. <br>
ROMANA: You have to plug it into your Tardis controls, just there. <br>
(There's a new socket available to receive it.) <br>
DOCTOR: A hole. What's a hole doing in my Tardis? <br>
ROMANA: I put it there. <br>
DOCTOR: You? You put a hole in my T? Never mind, old girl. Never mind.
I'll soon have it fixed. <br>
ROMANA: When plugged into the control console, the core indicates the
space-time coordinates of each segment of the Key. <br>
(The Doctor puts the rod into the hole.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's clever. That's very clever. Ah! Four one eight zero.
<br>
ROMANA: I'll look up those coordinates, shall I. <br>
DOCTOR: No, there's no need. <br>
ROMANA: Well, don't you want to know what planet it is? <br>
DOCTOR: I know. Cyrrhenis Minima. <br>
ROMANA: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: Just a matter of experience, you see. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, of course. <br>
DOCTOR: What else does it do? <br>
ROMANA: Well, it locates the segment at close range once we've landed
on the appropriate planet. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ha. Well, that could be very useful. <br>
ROMANA: And then, when it's brought into contact with a disguised
segment, it converts it back into its proper form. What would you like
me to do? <br>
DOCTOR: Well. I'd like you to stay out of my way as much as possible
and try and keep out of trouble. I don't suppose you can make tea? <br>
ROMANA: Tea? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I don't suppose you can. They don't teach you anything
useful at the Academy, do they. Gadgets and gimmickry. Never touch,
never trust gimmicky gadgets. <br>
ROMANA: That's hardly a gimmick, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah ah. <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Look. The coordinates have changed. They're different already.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A howling wind, and snow on the flagstones. A man
climbs over the parapet and heads towards a door in the main tower. A
man with an East End accent calls to him.) <br>
GARRON [OC]: Unstoffe! Unstoffe, you blithering idiot. Give me a hand! <br>
(Unstoffe pulls his large companion over the parapet. Everyone say Hi!
to the magnificent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193868/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Iain
Cuthbertson</a>.) <br>
UNSTOFFE: Don't step on the edge, it's slippery. <br>
GARRON: Not only slippery, it's perishing cold! Now come on, let's get
cracking. <br>
(They kneel by a raised metal cover set into the flagstones and start
unclamping it.) <br>
GARRON: Now, quiet. If we get caught up here. <br>
(They remove the cover. A bell tolls.) <br>
UNSTOFFE: Curfew. <br>
GARRON: Yeah. The moment it stops, drop the meat. <br>
(Down in the Jewel Room of the Tower, the Captain of the
Guard&nbsp; finishes tolling the bell and uses his spread-eagle
headed staff to 'extinguish' the electric lights, leaving only candles
burning. The two guards bow towards the Crown Jewels and leave. Finally
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0359417/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Prentis
Hancock</a> - for it is he - kneels and backs out of the room.
Unstoffe drops a large leg of meat down the hole. Something snarls
below.) <br>
UNSTOFFE: You sure that'll work? <br>
GARRON: Don't worry. The ladder. Come on. Get those grapples on, that's
right. The other one. Drop it. That's the idea. <br>
(Unstoffe hooks a rolled up rope ladder onto the edge of the hole and
drops it down. <br>
(The Captain of the Guard bars the door to the Jewel Room and the
guards pull ropes that opens a panel in the wall. Very large clawed
feet scrabble to be let out into the Jewel Room.) <br>
UNSTOFFE: Why is it always me? Why do I always get these jobs? <br>
GARRON: You're young. I'm too old to go down there. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Well, I want a chance to be old, too. <br>
GARRON: Unstoffe, do you think at your age I wouldn't climbed down
there? Without the ladder, I'd have gone. I love danger. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Ah! Now you admit it. It is dangerous. <br>
GARRON: Don't make me lose faith in you, my boy. Now, it's time you
went. <br>
(Unstoffe puts a bag on a rope around his neck and starts to go down
the ladder. Garron settles into a sheltered corner of the roof.) <br>
GARRON: Have you got the jethrik? <br>
UNSTOFFE: Of course! <br>
GARRON: Well, don't drop it whatever. Guard it with your life. <br>
UNSTOFFE: What? <br>
GARRON: I mean, just, just guard it. Remember its value. <br>
(Unstoffe goes down into the Shrivenzale's pen next to the Jewel Room.
The big creature is asleep, presumably drugged by the meat. Unstoffe
crawls into the Jewel Room and goes over to the main central display
case, where the Crown and other regalia are. He takes a suction cup and
glass cutter from his bag, fastens it to the display case and looks
around nervously.)

<br>
ROMANA: You're sulking. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not sulking. <br>
ROMANA: That's ridiculous for somebody as old as you are. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not old. What? <br>
ROMANA: Seven hundred and fifty nine? <br>
DOCTOR: Seven hundred and fifty six. That's not old, that's just
mature. <br>
ROMANA: You've lost count somewhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I ought to know my own age. <br>
ROMANA: Yes, but after the first few centuries, I expect things get a
little bit foggy, don't they. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, listen. It's no good, this isn't going to work. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, you're not giving me a chance. It's funny, you know,
but before I met you, I was even willing to be impressed. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. <br>
ROMANA: Oh yes. Of course, now I realise that your behaviour simply
derives from a subtransitory experiential hypertoid induced condition,
aggravated, I expect, by multi-encephalogical tensions. <br>
DOCTOR: What's that supposed to mean? <br>
ROMANA: Well, to put it very simply, Doctor, you're suffering from a
massive compensation syndrome. <br>
DOCTOR: Is that the sort of rubbish they're pouring into your head at
the Academy? <br>
ROMANA: Do you know, I might even use your case in my thesis when I'm
back on Gallifrey. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll show you whether I'm suffering from a massive compensation
syndrome. And you're not going back to Gallifrey, not for a long time
yet, I regret to say. Read out those coordinates again. <br>
ROMANA: Forty nine four zero, vector's unchanged. <br>
DOCTOR: Same as before. Distance? <br>
ROMANA: One hundred and sixteen parsecs. <br>
DOCTOR: One hundred and sixteen parsecs. Must be the planet of Ribos.
If it changes again while we're in the vortex, we could lose it. On the
other hand <br>
ROMANA: Oh, take a chance. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll make the decisions here! <br>
ROMANA: Well, what shall we do? <br>
DOCTOR: We'll take a chance.

with a gold crest on his Cossack hat who is accompanied by a
battle-scarred veteran in metal breast plate and a guard in full face
metal helmets and red cloaks. Garron offers a scroll, and speaks with a
refined Scottish accent.) <br>
GARRON: Allow me to present my credentials. <br>
GRAFF: Can't we get out of this wind first? It's cutting through me
like a laser. <br>
GARRON: I have quarters prepared for your Highness, but your escort <br>
GRAFF: What about them? <br>
GARRON: Well, my letter did stress the necessity for discretion. I
mean, soldiers stomping about, you know. <br>
SHOLAKH: The Graff never travels without his personal guard. <br>
GARRON: Please. These are primitive people, easily panicked. I mean, if
you frighten them, they could turn very nasty. We don't want any
unpleasantness at this stage, do we? <br>
GRAFF: Oh, let's get inside. Send the guard back, Sholakh. <br>
SHOLAKH: Highness. Royal guard, return to your ship. Dismiss! <br>
(The guards leave.) <br>
GARRON: This way, Highness, if you'd be so kind. <br>
(Garron, the Graff and Sholakh go into the castle. When then entrance
is clear, the Tardis materialises. The Doctor steps out carrying a
ladies long white fur coat.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ha ha! Fresh! <br>
ROMANA: It's bitter. <br>
DOCTOR: If you can't stand the cold, stay out of the freezer. Which
way? <br>
ROMANA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you've got the core. <br>
ROMANA: Oh, yes. Through there. It's a strong signal. <br>
(It sounds like a Geiger counter.) <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Now, pay attention. I'm not anticipating any trouble, but
it's as well to be prepared for these things. Ground rules. Rule one,
do exactly as I say. Rule two, stick close to me, and Rule three, let
me do all the talking. Is that perfectly clear? <br>
ROMANA: You couldn't make it clearer. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. One more thing. Your name. <br>
ROMANA: What about my name? <br>
DOCTOR: It's too long. By the time I've called look out, what's your
name?&nbsp;<br>
ROMANA: Romanadvoratnelundar. <br>
DOCTOR: By the time I've called that out, you could be dead. I'll call
you Romana. <br>
ROMANA: I don't like Romana. <br>
DOCTOR: It's either Romana or Fred. <br>
ROMANA: All right, call me Fred. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. Come on, Romana. Here, try that for size. <br>
(He gives her the white fur coat and walks through the archway into the
city.) <br>
ROMANA: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: The secret of survival is always to expect the unexpected.
<br>
(Scraping of stone against stone then the Doctor calls out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! Ow! <br>
(The Doctor is hanging inside a large net.) <br>
ROMANA: Ah. I think this is to stop animals wandering into the city at
night. There's a cocking lever there, just below the keystone. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes I wondered if you'd notice that. That's good. That's very
good, very good.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Candles, rugs, furs, wooden furniture. Very
mediaeval.) <br>
GARRON: Ribos orbits its sun elliptically, so its climate is one of
extremes. For the natives, the seasons are called Icetime and Suntime. <br>
GRAFF: How long are the seasons? <br>
GARRON: Approximately thirty two of your years, Highness.
Unfortunately, of course, you're not seeing the planet at its best just
now. <br>
GRAFF: If I bought it, Garron, it would not be my intention to spend a
lot of time here. <br>
GARRON: For someone in your exalted position, Highness, I should've
thought it would've made an ideal second home. I get very few
properties so central and so convenient. Only three light centuries
from the Magellanic Clouds. <br>
SHOLAKH: Is Shur the only city? <br>
GARRON: The principal city. There are several settlements to the north,
though I've never seen them. Oh, incidentally, if anyone asks you where
we're from, just say the North. I've arranged a travel pass in case of
any problems. <br>
GRAFF: Do they know anything of other worlds? <br>
GARRON: Nothing, Highness. <br>
SHOLAKH: They know that this planet is within the Greater Cyrrhenic
Empire, and that they are protected by the forces of the Alliance? <br>
GARRON: Beyond their comprehension. They're only primitive, brutish
peasants, you see. <br>
GRAFF: The property becomes more unattractive every minute. <br>
GARRON: There is a great demand for planets that are completely
unspoiled and so central. There are very few of them coming on the
market today. <br>
GRAFF: A predictable reply, Garron. You're interested in making a sale.
<br>
GARRON: And you are interested in buying, Highness, or you'd not be
here. So we're really discussing how much you're willing to pay. Am I
right? <br>
GRAFF: A great deal less than the ten million opeks you're asking. <br>
GARRON: The Magellanic Mining Conglomerate set that valuation. <br>
GRAFF: But you are empowered to accept an offer? <br>
GARRON: I'll leave the documents of title and mortmain with you for you
to read. And tomorrow, if you're still interested, it will be my
pleasure to show you over the city. Until then, may you rest in peace. <br>
(Garron leaves. The Graff and Sholakh take papers to read.) <br>
GRAFF: I think he'll take six million. <br>
SHOLAKH: Highness, this is interesting. <br>
GRAFF: What is it? <br>
SHOLAKH: The Conglomerate's mineralogical survey. <br>
GRAFF: It's almost fifty years ago. That's soon after they acquired
title. Bismuth, cadmium, iron. Jethrik! <br>
SHOLAKH: What is it, Highness? <br>
GRAFF: Point zero zero zero one percent of mass. That's not possible,
Sholakh. It must be a mistake. <br>
SHOLAKH: Highness. <br>
GRAFF: Jethrik, the rarest and most valuable element in the galaxy. <br>
SHOLAKH: As you say, a mistake. If it were true, the Conglomerate would
not be selling. <br>
GRAFF: Ah, but wait, there's a condition. (reads) Whilst relinquishing
freehold and suzerainty in the planet Ribos in the constellation of
Scytha, Magellanic Mining etcetera, etcetera, retains to itself, its
subsidiaries and appointed agents the exploitation of the mineral
wealth of the said planet in perpetuity. They know about it, Sholakh! <br>
SHOLAKH: Does this affect your Highness's plans? <br>
GRAFF: Sholakh, jethrik could guarantee success, and quicker than ever
seemed possible. </font></p>

communicator.) <br>
GRAFF [OC]: This planet contains a fortune, don't you see? And all we
have to do is dig it out. <br>
GARRON: Good thinking, Graff. <br>
(Footsteps approach. Garron turns off his wrist-comm, then walks past
the Doctor and Romana whilst calling out in a mummerset accent.) <br>
GARRON: Four o'clock and all's well caused. <br>

DOCTOR: Extraordinary. <br>
ROMANA: What is? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you heard. <br>
ROMANA: Four of the clock and all's well? Obviously just a ritual
greeting and reassurance. <br>
DOCTOR: But he said it in a Somerset accent. Somerset's one of the
Earth counties. <br>
ROMANA: Ah, but there's no space service to Ribos, Doctor. According to
Bartholomew's Planetary Gazetteer, it has a protected class three
society. So there can't be any Earth aliens on Ribos. <br>
DOCTOR: Maybe he's a cricket scout. Yes, they could do with a good leg
spinner. <br>

moment until I've won back the Levithian crown which is mine by right?
Everything, everything must be subordinate to that purpose. <br>
SHOLAKH: Forgive me, Highness. I know that nothing will ever weaken
your resolve. <br>
GRAFF: Correct, Sholakh. But it would seem that providence has placed
in my hand a weapon already forged. <br>
SHOLAKH: I don't understand. <br>
GRAFF: Sholakh, this planet is ideally placed for use as a forward
base. But to give it a technology, to train primitives in a thousand
skills, to raise a battle fleet with which to conquer our homeland
would be the work of a lifetime. <br>
SHOLAKH: There is no better way to spend a lifetime, Highness. <br>
GRAFF: But if we can find this jethrik, if we mine it and sell it, we
could hire an army and a hundred battle cruisers. <br>
SHOLAKH: You mean from outside the Alliance? <br>
GRAFF: Well, of course! Pontonese ships, mercenaries from Shalankie.
Why, it might not even be necessary to sell the jethrik. We could trade
with them directly. <br>
SHOLAKH: Oh, dangerous if it came to the ears of the Alliance. <br>
GRAFF: The time saved would be worth the risk.

GARRON: Well, naturally we'd make a small contribution to the funds.

Raised an expedition force to go off to the Frontier Wars, leaving his
half-brother on the throne. And when the wars was ended, his people
refused to let him return. <br>

measurements of those little lights and of our sun, and I can prove
that Ribos moves. It circles our sun, travelling far away and then
returning. That's the reason we have our two seasons, Suntime and
Icetime. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Nobody believed you. <br>
BINRO: Nah, those blockheads. They prefer to believe that Ribos is some
sort of battleground over which the Sun Gods and the Ice Gods fight for
supremacy. They said that if I did not publicly recant my belief, the
gods would destroy our world. <br>
UNSTOFFE: And did you? <br>
BINRO: In the end. See these hands? Useless for work now. That's why I
live here. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Binro, supposing I were to tell you that everything you've
just said is absolutely true. There are other worlds, other suns. <br>
BINRO: You believe it too? <br>
UNSTOFFE: I know it for a fact. You see I come from one of those other
worlds. <br>
BINRO: You? <br>
UNSTOFFE: I thought I should tell you, because one day, even here, in
the future, men will turn to each other and say, Binro was right.

UNSTOFFE: You cabberly old hypocrite. How could you? <br>
GARRON: Well, I admit I had a great trouble with me conscience.
Fortunately, I won.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Seeker is dowsing her path with a pair of leg
bones.) <br>
SEEKER: Deeper, fibula and tibia. Lead us deeper, deeper yet. SHOLAKH:
Highness? <br>
GRAFF: By those rocks over there. Something moved. <br>
SHOLAKH: You two. Bring him here. <br>
(Two bodyguards go forward and return with the old heretic.) <br>
GRAFF: What are you doing here? <br>
BINRO: Looking for fossils. <br>
GRAFF: Fossils? Grave robbing, more like. <br>
BINRO: I sell them sometimes. You see, I cannot work. I am too old. <br>
SHOLAKH: What's in your hand? <br>
(Sholakh takes Unstoffe's wrist communicator from Binro.) <br>
SHOLAKH: A strange fossil, Highness. All right, where'd you get this
from? <br>
BINRO: Found it. <br>
SHOLAKH: Come on, the truth, old one, or we'll blast your head off. <br>
GRAFF: Not yet. Bring him. <br>
SEEKER: Deeper, deeper, and even deeper. <br>
(As the last bodyguard passes, we see the end of a striped scarf
trailing from under his cloak.)

formed cannon and aim it at the entrance to the Catacombs.) <br>
CAPTAIN: That'll do. Now, pack it with shot. They say none ever returns
from the deep Catacombs, and if any of that lot do, they won't get very
far.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cave]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SEEKER: The bones, the bones, the bones, the bones
are alive! The one you seek is here! <br>
BINRO: This is where, Highness. I'll show you. <br>
SHOLAKH: Stay! <br>
BINRO: Unstoffe! Unstoffe! <br>
GRAFF: Kill him! <br>
GARRON: You fool! You fool! <br>
(Binro is shot in the back and falls into Unstoffe's arms.) <br>
BINRO: Right. I was right, Unstoffe? <br>
UNSTOFFE: Yes. <br>
(Binro dies.) <br>
GARRON: Was that Binro? Charming fellow, the little I saw of him. <br>
UNSTOFFE: They're murderers. They're murderers! <br>
GARRON: Now don't be a fool. Don't be a fool, Unstoffe! <br>
UNSTOFFE: Murderers! <br>
GARRON: Unstoffe, don't be <br>
(Unstoffe gets shot in the shoulder as he rushes the Graff. He sinks to
his knees. Garron runs to him.) <br>
GARRON: Unstoffe! Unstoffe! <br>
(The cave roof begins to fall in.) <br>
SHOLAKH: Over here! Hurry! <br>
UNSTOFFE: Binro said the roof wasn't safe. <br>
GRAFF: Guards, the jethrik! <br>
UNSTOFFE: Here, take it. <br>
(Unstoffe throws the bag towards the Graff.) <br>
GARRON: No, Unstoffe. <br>
(Sholakh picks the bag up.) <br>
SHOLAKH: It's here, Highness, and the gold. <br>
GRAFF: Good. When these criminals have been executed, we shall almost
have settled our score here. Now, how did you escape, Garron? <br>
GARRON: Ingenuity, Highness. Sheer ingenuity. <br>
GRAFF: And where are the others, your two accomplices? <br>
GARRON: Not accomplices, Highness. You mean the Security agents. <br>
GRAFF: Security agents? <br>
GARRON: Yeah, that's the irony of it. They just arrested us for landing
on a Class three planet and didn't even know of your presence until you
made it felt. <br>
GRAFF: You lie! <br>
GARRON: Why should I bother? No, Graff, their report will be with the
Alliance shortly, and you'll no longer be a nobleman of the Cyrrhenic
Empire, and an honoured war veteran. You'll just be a common criminal
like us! <br>
GRAFF: Stand them against that wall! <br>
(The bodyguards push Garron and Unstoffe against the rock while the
Doctor blows his dog whistle.) <br>
SHOLAKH: Firing squad, fall in! <br>
GARRON: Unstoffe, my son. <br>
UNSTOFFE: What? <br>
GARRON: I was going to make a touching speech, but my throat is too
dry. <br>
(A shrivenzale enters the cave.) <br>
SHOLAKH: Stand fast. Attack the beast!

K9: Position determined, mistress. This way. <br>
ROMANA: There's a good computer.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(It causes rockfalls even here.) <br>
SHOLAKH: Back, Highness, back. <br>
(The roof falls in on the bodyguards as the Seeker screams.) <br>
SHOLAKH: No. No, Highness, leave me. I'm done. <br>
GRAFF: Not you, Sholakh. Never. <br>
SHOLAKH: My guts are flattened. <br>
GRAFF: Look, I'll get you out. You'll be all right. <br>
SHOLAKH: The jethrik, Highness. Take the jethrik. <br>
GRAFF: Here, you, help me with my general. <br>
SEEKER: Too late. He is dead. <br>
GRAFF: Leave us! <br>
(The Seeker and a bodyguard leave. The Graff closes Sholakh's eyes.) <br>
GRAFF: I'll avenge you, Sholakh. I'll bombard this stinking planet till
it's nothing but a smoking hole in space! <br>
(The Graff kisses Sholakh's eyelids, takes the jethrik, a weapon and
the gold, and leaves. There are still two warm bodies here behind a
wall of rock.) <br>
UNSTOFFE: Come on, now, Garron. <br>
GARRON: Oh, I'm dead already. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Get up. <br>
GARRON: Oops. Oh, such lousy shots. They got me in the foot. <br>
UNSTOFFE: You're not shot. The roof just fell in. <br>
GARRON: So we're buried alive. Oh, Unstoffe, I don't like the options
we're getting. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Shush. Listen. <br>
(On the other side of the rockfall.) <br>
ROMANA: Listen, K9. There's somebody behind there. Hello, can you hear
me? <br>
(The sound of rock hitting rock.) <br>
ROMANA: There is someone. Help me move this rock, K9. Oh. Oh, it's no
good. It won't budge. Can you do anything to help, K9? <br>
K9: Affirmative. Please stand clear, mistress. <br>
(K9 lasers the rocks to atoms without any more falling into their
place.) <br>
GARRON: Oh, my dear. Oh, there you are. I've been looking for you
everywhere! You, er, dropped this. <br>
(Garron gives Romana the tracer.) <br>
ROMANA: Into your hand, yes. Let's go, shall we?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Catacombs]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Graff joins the Seeker and his 'bodyguard'.) <br>
GRAFF: Soldier, I'm going to blow up these caves behind us. <br>
SEEKER: What are you doing, alien? The Ice Gods <br>
GRAFF: Silence! These caves will not shelter your scum from my
missiles. Now, you made a prophecy, old woman. What was it? <br>
SEEKER: All but one doomed to die. Thus written. <br>
GRAFF: Then die now. <br>
(The Graff kills the Seeker.) <br>
GRAFF: No, not you soldier. I have a more honourable purpose for you.
So you're the last of my guards, eh? The last of my Levithian
Invincibles. All the rest are dead now, even Sholakh. Were you with me
on Skarrn, soldier? <br>
DOCTOR: No, sir. <br>
GRAFF: So many battles, Skarrn, the Freytus labyrinth, Crestus Minor.
Now there was a fight! I remember Sholakh planting my standard in the
very heart of the Crestan general! So many battles, so many years, but
over now. All but one of us doomed to die, soldier. Thus has it been
written. <br>
(The Graff produces a small box, and sets it beeping. He gives it to
the Doctor.) <br>
GRAFF: There is no greater honour, soldier, then to surrender your life
in the service of the Graff Vynda-K. <br>
(The Graff embraces his soldier as if to kiss him on both cheeks, then
walks up the Catacombs with the sounds of past battles ringing in his
head.) <br>
GRAFF: All but one of us! Sholakh. Sholakh? Sholakh! To me! To me!
Charge! Onwards! Onwards! Push their attack back! Onwards! Onwards! <br>
(The Graff goes around a corner, still calling to dead soldiers.) <br>
DOCTOR: Three, two, one. <br>
(Bang! Scream! The Doctor bends forward so his helmet falls off then
lets his breath out and holds up the jethrik.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor and Romana return to the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Four o'clock and all's well. Goodbye, Garron! <br>
GARRON: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
GARRON: Doctor, I still don't understand. <br>
DOCTOR: What don't you understand, Garron? Go on, ask me something.
What is it don't you understand? Who came first, the chicken or the
egg? Go on, ask me something. Ask me something. <br>
GARRON: How did you manage to switch the jethrik for the thermite pack
without the Graff noticing? <br>
DOCTOR: Garron, I would've thought you'd have known that. Sleight of
hands. GARRON: Oh. <br>
DOCTOR: I was trained by Maskelyne. <br>
ROMANA: Quite clever, really. <br>
DOCTOR: I do dislike faint praise. It was astoundingly clever, wasn't
it Garron? <br>
GARRON: Indeed it was, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
GARRON: Oh, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
GARRON: A favour to beg. Do you think I might just handle the jethrik
once more? Please? For old time's sake, you know? <br>
DOCTOR: All right. <br>
GARRON: Oh, it's lovely, isn't it? I'm so reluctant to part with it. <br>
(Garron strokes the stone like a pet and turns his back on the Doctor,
putting it in his pocket before turning back.) <br>
GARRON: Oh, dear me. Well, there you are, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you very much. Goodbye, Garron. <br>
(The Doctor hugs Garron.) <br>
GARRON: Oh, goodbye, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: What's your name? <br>
UNSTOFFE: Unstoffe. <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Unstoffe. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Goodbye, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor goes into the Tardis.) <br>
K9: Mistress. <br>
ROMANA: Come along, K9. Goodbye. <br>
GARRON + UNSTOFFE: Goodbye. <br>
(K9 and Romana enter the Tardis and close the door.) <br>
UNSTOFFE: Well, that's it, Garron. We'll have to go straight now. <br>
GARRON: Oh come, my boy, don't be downhearted. We haven't done too
badly. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Haven't done too badly? We've lost the jethrik, and we've
come out of this without a penny. <br>
GARRON: Oh, don't forget that there's the Graff's ship stuffed with
eighteen years of loot. <br>
UNSTOFFE: You crafty old <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.) <br>
UNSTOFFE: That's a queer takeoff. <br>
GARRON: Well, thank goodness he's gone. I was afraid he'd notice. <br>
UNSTOFFE: Notice? What? <br>
GARRON: We haven't lost the jethrik. I switched it for a piece of
ordinary stone. Yeah, I did. Look! <br>
(Garron takes the stone from his pocket.) <br>
GARRON: He switched it back again. Oh, Unstoffe, is there nobody you
can trust these days?

table. The Doctor holds the tracer near it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Would you like to do it? Here. <br>
ROMANA: Well, perhaps you'd better do it, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: All right. No, you do it. Go on, you do it. I'll just stand
here and watch. <br>
ROMANA: Right. <br>
(Romana gently touches the jethrik with the tracer. It hums then turns
into an irregular section of hard perspex. Romana breathes again.) <br>
DOCTOR: The first segment. Simple, wasn't it. Only five more to go. </font>
