DOCTOR: You'd better stop the Tardis. We don't want any nasty jolts.
Prion, did you say? <br>
ROMANA: We're in the Prion planetary system. We'd better land. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. Hovering will do. <br>
ROMANA: There's a planet called Tigella. <br>
DOCTOR: Tigella? Never heard of it. <br>
ROMANA: Well, there's one called Zolfa-Thura. That's in the history
books. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we're all in somebody's history books. <br>
ROMANA: A great civilisation blown away to sand and ashes. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. <br>
ROMANA: Now all that's left is the Screens. <br>
DOCTOR: Why, what screens? <br>
ROMANA: The Screens of Zolfa-Thura. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, those screens. Well, of course I've been to Tigella.
Did you say Tigella? <br>
ROMANA: That's right. <br>
DOCTOR: I've been there. <br>
ROMANA: When? <br>
DOCTOR: Oo, well, a long time ago. Nice chap called Zastor showed me
around. Yes. Remind me to get in touch with him sometime. In fact, I'll
do it right now. <br>
ROMANA: No, no, no. Please, please, can we just do one thing at a time?
<br>
DOCTOR: First things first? <br>
ROMANA: Exactly. <br>
DOCTOR: But not necessarily in that order. Tigella. Zastor. </font></p>

cut into something. Their hairstyles are strongly reminiscent of Gerry
Anderson's UFO moonbase.) <br>

DEEDRIX: And quickly. <br>
WOMAN [OC]: Burn out on one four nine. Medical and lighting assistance
immediately. <br>
(Deedrix runs to his desk and uses the intercom.) <br>
DEEDRIX: Medical detail dispatched. <br>
MAN 2 [OC]: Air purification unit one malfunctioning. <br>
(An old man dressed very differently from the others we have seen
enters.) <br>
DEEDRIX: Open up air vents three to eight in unit one. Zastor. <br>
ZASTOR: This is no time for formality. Please continue. <br>
MAN 3 [OC]: Irrigation levels holding steady. <br>
DEEDRIX: Thank you. Clearing.&nbsp;<br>
ZASTOR: Well, how bad is it, Deedrix? <br>
DEEDRIX: We can't control it much longer. <br>
ZASTOR: So much for science. <br>
DEEDRIX: Without detailed investigation, there's nothing science can
do. <br>
ZASTOR: Believe me, I understand. <br>
DEEDRIX: I've always argued <br>
ZASTOR: That's certainly true. <br>
DEEDRIX: For thousands of years our lives have been dominated by a
mystery. The Dodecahedron belongs to all of us, not just the Deons. <br>
ZASTOR: Their religion deserves respect. <br>
DEEDRIX: Religion. Control to walkway nine. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DEEDRIX: Thank you, Caris. Understood. All this
rather proves her point. <br>
ZASTOR: How can we re-inhabit the surface? It would take years of
preparation. <br>
DEEDRIX: Decades, more likely. There are better ways, but at least she
has a rational plan. <br>
ZASTOR: Which the Deons have declared a blasphemy. <br>
DEEDRIX: You could overrule them. <br>
ZASTOR: How long would I remain leader if I were to? <br>
DEEDRIX: And Tigella? Zastor, I tell you as a savant, a scientist, one
who works hard to understand these things, that our safe and bountiful
city may well be on the edge of total extinction. </font></p>

dais in front of the Priestess when a black clothed man enters. He
whispers to the Priestess.) <br>

formerly Barbara, one of the original companions.) <br>
LEXA: Zastor is our leader, but he cannot lead us into sacrilege.
Resume the Concurrence. I shall explain this yet again to Zastor. <br>

her tall headdress.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> ZASTOR: I understand your anger, Lexa. <br>
LEXA: The power is angrier than we are. <br>
ZASTOR: But at the moment seems to be a little more controlled. So
perhaps should we be. The savants are trying to help, or so they
believe. <br>
LEXA: Believe? A word to large for their small minds.) <br>
(They go down a spiral staircase.) <br>
LEXA: They're children. Wilful, ignorant and lost. <br>
ZASTOR: As we all will be, savants and Deons alike, if the power fails
us. <br>
LEXA: Why are we going to the debating chamber? This is hardly a matter
for compromise. <br>
ZASTOR: I'm an old man, Lexa, with less faith perhaps than you, but I
think you trust my judgment. <br>
LEXA: Yes. <br>
ZASTOR: They have some proposals. They will not touch the Dodecahedron.
<br>
LEXA: They cannot enter the Power room! <br>
(A distant rumble alarms her.) <br>
ZASTOR: Some measurement, a few calculations. <br>
LEXA: Oh, not even you, Zastor, can revoke the ancient laws. <br>
(Deedrix meets them.) <br>
DEEDRIX: And your Concurrence, Lexa, cannot revoke the laws of physics.
<br>
ZASTOR: Deedrix, Lexa, we must behave like leaders. <br>
DEEDRIX: Then lead us by example, Zastor. Make a decision! <br>
ZASTOR: I cannot interfere. I was afraid it would come to this. (to a
guard) Yes, please, ask him to come. <br>
LEXA: Ask? Who? <br>
DEEDRIX: Some new procrastination, Zastor? <br>
ZASTOR: Some fifty years ago, I knew a man who solved the insoluble by
the strangest means. He sees the threads that join the universe
together and mends them when they break. <br>
DEEDRIX: A savant? Or one of her madmen. <br>
ZASTOR: A little of each and a great deal more of something else. He's
nearby and asking to visit us. <br>
DEEDRIX: You sent for an alien? <br>
LEXA: Why? <br>
ZASTOR: You'll know when you see him. This probably needs his delicacy
of touch. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: He'd better not go in the sea in future.
He's likely to get into deep water, you know. <br>
ROMANA: It was hardly his fault that someone neglected to sea-proof
him. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite. Can you remember where I left his manual? <br>
ROMANA: Yes, of course. <br>
(On the floor under the coat stand.) <br>
ROMANA: Oh, I hope he's going to be all right. We're going to need him
on Tigella. <br>
DOCTOR: Why? They're not hostile. <br>
ROMANA: The plants are. Lush, aggressive vegetation. <br>
DOCTOR: You mustn't believe everything you read in books. <br>
ROMANA: It says in the history books that it was the lush, aggressive
vegetation that forced the Tigellans to retreat beneath the surface.
You must have seen it last time you were there. <br>
DOCTOR: It was reasonably friendly to me. Mind you, it was a long time
ago. <br>
(Romana finds the page in the manual.) <br>
ROMANA: Post repair test questions. <br>
(The Doctor takes the book from her.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ahem. Post repair test questions. K9, can you hear me? <br>
K9: Affirmative, (pause) mistress. <br>
DOCTOR: That's a promising start. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Everyone is shouting at once.) <br>
ZASTOR: Silence! Savants, Deons, remember the dignity of your high
office. Have we been elected to squabble? If we cannot agree, we will
at least have order. <br>
DEEDRIX: I've said all I have to say. I am needed back in the control
room. <br>
LEXA: No! The Savants should be arrested for heresy. <br>
DEEDRIX: And crushed to death, no doubt. <br>
ZASTOR: Please, you will not mock the old laws. <br>
DEEDRIX: Well, how can there be any respect for a creed that practices
primitive sacrifice. Are you making sacrifices now in the name of your
monstrous myth? <br>
ZASTOR: Please, Deedrix, remember where you are. <br>
DEEDRIX: No! This should be said before all Tigella. The Dodecahedron
is no god! It is an artefact! Engineered. <br>
LEXA: It descended from the heavens! <br>
DEEDRIX: Not the heavens. From somewhere, anywhere, but not the
heavens. <br>
LEXA: Then where? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (On the dusty planet, with Tigella hanging in the
sky, a hatch opens in a space module and a man in semi-Cossack,
semi-renaissance clothing leads a motley group carefully out onto the
surface and across to a set of five giant pentagons propped up in the
sand forming a pentagon. One of the group is to be wearing a normal
three-piece suit. The leader is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0292077/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Bill Fraser</a>, a grand
old character actor.) <br>
GRUGGER: Well? <br>
BROTADAC: Sand. Nothing but sand. The whole planet. <br>
GRUGGER: Except for those. <br>
BROTADAC: Bring an Earthling to the screens of Zolfa-Thura. I never
liked this job. <br>
GRUGGER: Male Caucasian around two metres tall. <br>
BROTADAC: Right, we've delivered him. So who pays us? <br>
GRUGGER: Shut up. He's trying to say something. <br>
BROTADAC: It could be a trap. What does he know, anyway? <br>
EARTHLING: Nothing. I don't know anything. What have I done? <br>
GRUGGER: Nobody knows anything. <br>
EARTHLING: Why? Why me? <br>
GRUGGER: Why any of us? Do you think I do this through choice? Oh, give
him another one. <br>
(Brotadac gives the Earthling a hypospray in the neck.) <br>
GRUGGER: The message was genuine. We'll wait. <br>
BROTADAC: Genuine? We don't even know who sent it. Let's kill him and
go. <br>
GRUGGER: Let's think, for a change. Now, why would you send across the
galaxy for a thing like that? <br>
(The ground shakes, and a five-sided chamber rises up in the middle of
the screens. A doorway opens and Grugger moves forward.) <br>
BROTADAC: Stop! It must be a trap. <br>
GRUGGER: Shut up and follow me. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They enter a gleaming white room with shiny metal
control panels, and a large cactus on stand near the middle of the
room. Brotadac stuffs a piece of movable equipment into his pocket.) <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Arrival noted, gentlemen. Welcome. Don't be afraid. <br>
GRUGGER: Huh. Who do you think you're talking to? <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: General Grugger, Lieutenant Brotadac, I presume, together
with their band of fortune hunters. There should also be an Earthling
somewhere. <br>
(Grugger gestures for the prisoner to be brought in.) <br>
GRUGGER: You. What are you? <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Ah, forgive me. Most remiss. I am Meglos, only survivor of
this planet. <br>
(They stare at the cactus.) <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Well observed, General Grugger. I am the plant. A
xerophyte, to be precise. Ah! Ah, you've served me well, General
Grugger. I now have a real proposition for you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Debating chamber]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The shouting match has resumed.) <br>
ZASTOR: This chamber will yield to my authority! <br>
DEEDRIX: You've lost it, delegated it to these aliens. <br>
LEXA: A Time Lord! A non-believer. Why should we trust him? <br>
ZASTOR: The Doctor's good faith is beyond question. <br>
DEEDRIX: Faith! That word again. What we need is knowledge! <br>
ZASTOR: He brings that, too. <br>
DEEDRIX: We have it here, if you will allow us to use it. <br>
LEXA: Oh, squabbles go round and round. Nothing is decided here. I
shall seek guidance from the Power itself. <br>
CARIS: I have something to say to this chamber <br>
LEXA: No. <br>
ZASTOR: Caris has risked her life to save this city. I wish to hear
her. <br>
CARIS: Even if we manage to restore the power, or as the Deons would
say, if the power condescends to restore itself, the food stocks will
be destroyed. We will have to ascend to the surface. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Meglos' laboratory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BROTADAC: It's a waste of time. Let's get our
payment and go. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: You Gaztaks pillage the galaxy. There are a thousand small
marauding bands like yours. And what's it all for? <br>
BROTADAC: Loot! <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: A motley collection of trophies. How long did it take you
to accumulate? <br>
BROTADAC: Done it all our lives. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Pah! And you accuse me of wasting your time. <br>
GRUGGER: What you're asking us to do is impossible. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Impossible, or simply beyond your comprehension? <br>
BROTADAC: There's only one way into that city. <br>
GRUGGER: And they guard that Dodecahedron with their lives. To them,
it's a god. <br>
BROTADAC: They say the thing's dangerous to touch. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Really, gentlemen, I have considered the hazards. But your
timidity worries me. You're not interested in the real power. So, if
Lieutenant Brotadac will return my redimensioner, we will conclude our
business. <br>
GRUGGER: What? <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: The redimensioner you removed from my desk. <br>
GRUGGER: Oh, you fool. What do you know about mass conversion
mechanics? <br>
(Brotadac replaces the device.) <br>
GRUGGER: I want to know a lot more about all this. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Bit of a nuisance if we have to
reprogramme all his constants. <br>
ROMANA: I'm more worried about the power depletion. At this rate he's
going to need recharging every two hours. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not a problem. I happen to be an expert in power
sources. <br>
ROMANA: Tigella won't take long, then. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. A quick flight, a quick service. <br>
ROMANA: What is the energy process, baryon multiplication? <br>
DOCTOR: Erm, er, yes. Yes, something like that. They didn't actually
let me see it last time. Religious objections. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Meglos' laboratory]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GRUGGER: The Dodecahedron was made here on
Zolfa-Thura? <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Of course. The Tigellans are using only a fraction of its
potential. <br>
GRUGGER: A fraction! It powers their entire planet. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Precisely. A mere fraction. The verdant fluctuations are
part of its inbuilt programming. In restart mode it's present output
will be raised to the power of twelve. It's energy could feed an entire
galaxy. <br>
GRUGGER: That's impossible. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Within your limited frame of reference, yes. Now, if you
will be so kind as to proceed. <br>
(The Earthling is led to the far side of the room and the cactus placed
next to him. Grugger goes to Meglos's desk.) <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: General Grugger, have I explained the procedure
sufficiently? <br>
GRUGGER: Yes, it's all right. It's this lever first and then that one
to start the process. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Excellent. Then let it commence. <br>
GRUGGER: Oh, we'll definitely let it commence. <br>
(Meglos and the Earthling slide back into alcoves. Screens come down in
front of them.) <br>
BROTADAC: This is the switch, is it? <br>
GRUGGER: Don't touch these controls, Brotadac. <br>
BROTADAC: Come on, he looks ready to me. <br>
GRUGGER: Yes, he does, doesn't he? <br>
BROTADAC: Well, what's the hang up? I want to get off of this planet. <br>
GRUGGER: Get the others. So do I, but it would be a pity to leave all
this. <br>
BROTADAC: You got a plan? <br>
GRUGGER: We can take that, and that, and that. How much will all that
be worth in Pallagos? <br>
BROTADAC: Fifty million credits? <br>
GRUGGER: Oh, that's very nice. <br>
BROTADAC: We struck lucky. <br>
GRUGGER: Lucky? Brains, Brotadac, brains. I think the four of us could
dismantle that. <br>
BROTADAC: We could break that one up. <br>
GRUGGER: No, no, that's a nice piece. <br>
BROTADAC: I'll go and get the others. <br>
GRUGGER: I've already sent for them. Why aren't they here? Go and see
what's happened to them. <br>
(But the door won't open.) <br>
BROTADAC: It's stuck! <br>
GRUGGER: Well, open it. <br>
BROTADAC: But it won't open. <br>
GRUGGER: What do you mean, it won't open. It won't open. <br>
BROTADAC: It opened all right when we come in. Automatically. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Correct, gentlemen. Automatically. <br>
GRUGGER: He's trapped us. <br>
BROTADAC: Didn't trust us. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Oh, nothing so petty. I knew that as, what shall we say,
ardent pragmatists, you would feel bound to attempt some variation of
our arrangement. I wanted it to come sooner rather than later. I know
you and your kind so well, and if we are to cooperate, I want you to
know me. <br>
GRUGGER: I see. Well, that's all right. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Well, gentlemen, shall we all descend together into the
earth for another thousand years or shall we resume our original
arrangements? <br>
GRUGGER: Well, I'm prepared to forget that little incident. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Oh, I hope not. <br>
BROTADAC: We'll remember. <br>
MEGLOS [OC]: Good. Now, the second button, please. <br>
(Grugger complies, and energy pulses through the alcoves. The cactus
starts to shrivel as the Earthling twitches.) <br>
BROTADAC: I don't believe it! <br>
(The Earthling's skin turns green, with spines. The screens rise again
and the transformed Earthling steps out.) <br>
MEGLOS: Thank you, General Grugger. Now we must work quickly. I've
intercepted a Tigellan message. They've sent for a travelling Time
Lord. <br>
(The Doctor's face and data come up on a monitor.) <br>
MEGLOS: Who's travels I must interrupt. Now, where is he, and when? </font></p>

DOCTOR: Oh. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Romana and Co find the only closed door.) <br>
ROMANA: He must be in there. K9, can you open it? <br>
K9: Affirmative, mistress. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Meglos is pacing.) <br>
MEGLOS: Three metres by five metres, and I could have had the galaxy.
The universe. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I've often puzzled about that. <br>
MEGLOS: What! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, why a good looking chap like you should want to control
the universe. <br>
MEGLOS: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I mean, it baffles me, this burning ambition to. Burning? <br>
MEGLOS: It's beyond your comprehension. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. Burning? <br>
(Most of the door falls away.) <br>
ROMANA: Doctor? Oh, good heavens. <br>
MEGLOS: Out of my way. <br>
(Deedrix and Caris grab Meglos.) <br>
DOCTOR: No, Meglos. Hold him! <br>
MEGLOS: You can't take me. <br>
EARTHLING: Got you this time, Meglos. <br>
(The cactus skin reappears.) <br>
MEGLOS: On the contrary, Earthling, it's merely you they've got. <br>
(A vegetable thing slides out of the figure and slithers out of the
hold.) <br>
EARTHLING: What's happened? What's going on? <br>
ROMANA: Was that Meglos? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
ROMANA: He must have modulated himself on a particular wavelength of
light. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. He's what you'd call a colourful personality. <br>
ROMANA: But that would make him virtually indestructible. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but we're not. Quick, back to the Tardis. Or do you want
to be atomised? <br>
EARTHLING: Atomised? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
EARTHLING: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Good. </font></p>

GRUGGER [OC]: It must be this button. <br>

ZASTOR: Well, we've made a beginning, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I'd like to stay and help you, but horticulture's not my
strong point. <br>
ROMANA [OC]: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
(Romana comes out of the Tardis.) <br>
ROMANA: Gallifrey. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
ROMANA: They want us back immediately. <br>
(She goes back into the Tardis.) <br>
DOCTOR: Gallifrey? Do they, indeed. Well, we'll see about that when
we've dropped our friend off home. Unless, of course, you want to stay
here and do some gardening? <br>
EARTHLING: Maybe I will. I'll be in trouble back home. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh? <br>
EARTHLING: I told the wife I'd be in from work in twenty minutes. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don't worry about that. We can get you back before you
leave. <br>
EARTHLING: Oh, good. </font> </p>
