shop on the corner of Mafeking
Terrace is doing his books, while an impressive array of cathode ray
television sets on shelves have a woman announcer on them, in black and
white.) <br>
ANNOUNCER [OC]: Orchestrations were arranged by Sir Rodney Fenning, and
Dame Eve English is a member of the Kings Lynn Players. So tune in
again next week for more from the What's My Line team. And that brings
us to the end of programming for today. So, from all of us here at
Alexandra Palace, a very good night. <br>

eating a toasted crumpet, while the son of the household reads a

RITA: He's a caution, that one! He does make me laugh. <br>
(The man of the house enters wearing suit and tie and a fair collection
medals on his chest, although no more than any Tommy would have earned
if he's actually seen combat.) <br>
GRAN: Our lord and master. <br>
EDDIE: Rita, I'm off out. <br>
TOMMY: Dad. <br>
EDDIE: Oh, how many times, son? We'll see. <br>
TOMMY: But everyone's getting a telly, dad. Even Mister Gallagher, and
the Bells at number sixty seven. <br>
EDDIE: Well, perhaps we'll get one for the Coronation. If you're lucky.
We'll see. Don't wait up. <br>
(Eddie leaves.) <br>
GRAN: I heard they rot your brains. Rot them into soup, and your brain
comes pouring out of your ears. That's what television does.

lightning strikes Magpie's television aerial. It glows red. Inside,
Magpie has fallen asleep over his books. Suddenly the little dot on the
television turns back into the image of the lady announcer.) <br>

MAGPIE: Eh? <br>
WIRE: Woo hoo! Can you hear me, Magpie? <br>
MAGPIE: Yes. I must be dreaming <br>
WIRE: Oh no, this isn't a dream. <br>
MAGPIE: I'm going doolally, then. <br>
WIRE : Not at all, sweetheart. Now, are you sitting comfortably? Good.
Then we'll begin. <br>

ROSE: I thought we'd be going for the Vegas era, you know the white
flares and the, grr, chest hair. <br>
(The Doctor has his hair in a Teddy boy quiff.) <br>
DOCTOR: You are kidding, aren't you? You want to see Elvis, you go for
the late fifties. The time before burgers. When they called him the
Pelvis and he still had a waist. What's more, you see him in style. <br>
(The Doctor rides a scooter out of the Tardis. He's wearing a white
crash helmet and
shades. He's a Mod, all right.) <br>
DOCTOR: You going my way, doll? <br>
ROSE: Is there any other way to go, daddy-o? Straight from the fridge,

DOCTOR: Hey, you speak the lingo. <br>
ROSE: Oh well, me, mum, Cliff Richard movies every Bank Holiday Monday.

DOCTOR: Ed Sullivan TV Studios. Elvis did Hound Dog on one of the
shows. There were loads of complaints. Bit of luck, we'll just catch
it. <br>
ROSE: And that'll be TV studios in, what, New York? <br>
DOCTOR: That's the one. <br>
(A red London bus drives past the end of the street. The Doctor pulls
up by a red post box and now we see lots of Union Flag bunting strung
between the houses.) <br>
ROSE: Ha! Digging that New York vibe. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, this could still be New York. I mean, this looks very New
York to me. Sort of Londony New York, mind. <br>

Muffin the Mule. Hello. <br>
EDDIE: Smashing. Smashing, innit? You'd have thought they was in the
room with you, eh? Fair do's Tommy, you had a point. New television.
There, that should cheer you up a bit, Rita. Give us a smile, then, eh?
<br>
RITA: I can't. Nothing's the same any more, not with her <br>
EDDIE: Stop going on about it. <br>
RITA: But her face, Eddie. What happened to her? That awful face. <br>

MAGPIE: There you go, sir, all wired up for the great occasion. <br>
DOCTOR: The great occasion? What do you mean? <br>
MAGPIE: Where've you been living, out in the Colonies? Coronation, of
course. <br>
DOCTOR: What Coronation's that then? <br>
MAGPIE: What do you mean? The Coronation. <br>
ROSE: It's the Queen's. Queen Elizabeth. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! Is this 1953? <br>
MAGPIE: Last time I looked. Time for a lovely bit of pomp and
circumstance, what we do best. <br>
ROSE: Look at all the TV aerials. Looks like everyone's got one. That's
weird. My nan said tellies were so rare they all had to pile into one
house. <br>
MAGPIE: Not around here, love. Magpie's Marvellous Tellies, only five
quid a pop. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, but this is a brilliant year. Classic! Technicolour,
Everest climbed, everything off the ration. The nation throwing off the
shadows of war and looking forward to a happier, brighter future. <br>
MRS GALLAGHER: Someone help me, please! Ted! <br>
(Two burly men in black suits bundle a person into the back of a car,
with a blanket over his head.) <br>
MRS GALLAGHER: Leave him alone! He's my husband! Please. <br>
DOCTOR: What's going on? <br>

TOMMY: Oi, what are you doing? <br>
BISHOP: Police business. Now, get out of the way, sir. <br>
ROSE: Who did they take? Do you know him? <br>
TOMMY: Must be Mister Gallagher. <br>

driving. Have you actually passed your test? <br>
DOCTOR: Men in black? Vanishing police cars? This is Churchill's
England, not Stalin's Russia. <br>

WIRE: Oh, we'll see. If you're a very good boy. <br>
MAGPIE: Please, you're burning me, inside, behind my eyes. It hurts.
Even my memories hurt. I just want things back like they used to be. <br>
WIRE: Oh, but this world of your is busy, busy, busy, forging ahead
into a brand new age. You can never go back. That's your tragedy. But

DOCTOR: Mister Connolly, what gender is the Queen? <br>
EDDIE: She's a female. <br>
DOCTOR: And are you suggesting the Queen does the housework? <br>
EDDIE: No. Not at all. <br>
DOCTOR: Then get busy. <br>

Jacks left, right and centre. <br>

EDDIE: Yes, that's right, isn't it? <br>

DOCTOR: No, the gentleman does. <br>

EDDIE: What the hell am I doing? Now you listen here, Doctor. You may
have fancy qualifications, but what goes on under my roof is my
business. <br>
DOCTOR: A lot of people are being bundled into <br>
EDDIE: I am talking! <br>
DOCTOR: And I'm not listening! Now you, Mister Connolly, you are
staring into a deep, dark pit of trouble if you don't let me help. So
I'm ordering you, sir! Tell me what's going on! <br>

EDDIE: She won't stop. She never stops. <br>
TOMMY: We started hearing stories, all round the place. People who've
changed. Families keeping it secret because they were scared. Then the
police started finding out. We don't know how, no one does. They just
turn up, come to the door and take them, any time of the day or night. <br>

(Another person is delivered to the holding area.) <br>
BISHOP: We started finding them about a month ago. Persons left sans
visage. Heads just blank. <br>
DOCTOR: Is there any sort of pattern? <br>
BISHOP: Yes, spreading out from North London. All over the city. Men,
women, kids, grannies. The only real lead is there's been quite a large
number in <br>
DOCTOR: Florizel Street. <br>
CRABTREE: Found another one, sir. <br>
BISHOP: Oh, er, good man, Crabtree. Here we are, Doctor. Take a good
look. See what you can deduce. <br>
(The pink shoes and skirt tell us even before Crabtree takes the
blanket off.) <br>
DOCTOR: Rose. <br>
BISHOP: You know her? <br>
DOCTOR: Know her? She <br>
CRABTREE: They found her in the street, apparently, over by (something)
Square, abandoned. <br>
BISHOP: That's unusual. That's the first one out in the open. Heaven
help us if something happens in public tomorrow for the big day. We'll
have Torchwood on our backs then, make no mistake. <br>
DOCTOR: They did what? <br>
BISHOP: I'm sorry? <br>
DOCTOR: They left her where? <br>
BISHOP: Just in the street. <br>
DOCTOR: In the street. They left her in the street. They took her face
and just chucked her out and left her in the street. And as a result,
that makes things simple. Very, very simple. Do you know why? <br>
BISHOP: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Because now, Detective Inspector Bishop, there is no power on
this Earth that can stop me. Come on!

here we go, it's started. Look, look. Take your places. Sit down, sit
down. That's it. There we are.<br>
(Eddie takes his comfy chair while the guests take the other seats and
the floor.) <br>
WILMOT [OC]: The East front of the palace on which all eyes are <br>
BETTY: Rita, love. Just look at that telly box then. Ee, innit
marvellous. The picture's so clear. <br>
EDDIE: Here, Bet. I says to Rita, I says, you didn't need to get your
hair done special, love. The Queen won't be able to see you! <br>
BETTY: Where's your old mum, then? She can't go missing it. <br>
RITA: Sorry. Er, mum can't make it down. <br>
BETTY: Oh, bless her. Maybe we could pop up and see her later. <br>
TOMMY: Maybe you could. It's a good idea. What do you think, dad? Maybe
Aunty Betty can go and see Gran later? <br>
EDDIE: Oh, he loves his Gran, this one. Proper little mummy's boy all
round. <br>
BETTY: Oh, you know what they say about them. Eddie, you want to beat
that out of him. <br>
EDDIE: That's exactly what I'm going to do. <br>
(The doorbell rings.) <br>
TOMMY: I'll get it. <br>
WILMOT [OC]: Will first appear in about ten minutes time riding in the
Gold Coach of State.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Front door]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Tommy, talk to me. I need to know exactly
what happened inside your house. <br>
EDDIE: What the blazes do you think you're doing? <br>
TOMMY: I want to help, dad. <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Connolly <br>
EDDIE: Shut your face, you, whoever you are. We can handle this
ourselves. Listen, you little twerp. You're hardly out of the
blooming' cradle, so I don't expect you to understand. But I've got a
position to maintain. People round here respect me. It matters what
people think. <br>
TOMMY: Is that why you did it, dad? <br>
EDDIE: What do you mean? Did what? <br>
TOMMY: You ratted on Gran. How else would the police know where to
look, unless some coward told them <br>
EDDIE: How dare you! Do you think I fought a war just so a mouthy
little scum like you could call me a coward? <br>
TOMMY: You don't get it, do you? You fought against fascism, remember?
People telling you how to live, who you could be friends with, who you
could fall in love with, who could live and who had to die. Don't you
get it? You were fighting so that little twerps like me could do what
we want, say what we want. Now you've become just like them. You've
been informing on everyone, haven't you? Even
Gran. All to protect your precious reputation. <br>
RITA: Eddie is that true? <br>
EDDIE: I did it for us, Rita. She was filthy. A filthy, disgusting
thing! <br>
RITA: She's my mother. All the others you informed on, all the people
in our street, our friends. <br>
EDDIE: I had to. I, I did the right thing. <br>
RITA: The right thing for us or for you, Eddie? You go, Tommy. Go with
the Doctor and do some good. Get away from this house, it's poison. We
had a ruddy monster under this roof, all right, but it weren't my
mother! <br>
(Rita slams the door shut on Eddie.) <br>
EDDIE: Rita! <br>
DOCTOR: Tommy? </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BETTY: What was all that, then? <br>
RITA: That was, that was the sound of something ending. And about time
too. Everyone all right? Smashing. Nothing's
going to spoil our big day, is it? </font></p>

party.) <br>
DOCTOR: Tommy, tell me about that night. The night she changed. <br>
TOMMY: She was just watching the telly. <br>
DOCTOR: Rose said it. She guessed it straight away. Of course she did.
All these aerials in one little street. How come? <br>
TOMMY: Bloke up the road, Mister Magpie, he's selling them cheap. <br>
BISHOP: Is he, now? <br>
DOCTOR: Come on! </font></p>

BISHOP [OC]: Here, you can't do that <br>
DOCTOR: Shop! If you're here, come out and talk to me! Magpie! <br>
TOMMY: Maybe he's out. <br>
DOCTOR: Looks like it <br>
(The Doctor searches the drawers of the counter and finds the portable
television.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, hello. This isn't right. This is very much not right.
Tastes like iron. Bakelite. Put together with human hands, yes, but the
design itself. Oh, beautiful work. That is so simple. <br>
BISHOP: That's incredible. It's like a television, but portable. A
portable television. <br>
(The Doctor raises his sonic screwdriver.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's not the only power source in this room. <br>
(The television screens each light up with a different face mouthing
help me.) <br>
TOMMY: Gran? <br>
(Rose is mouthing Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm on my way. <br>
(Magpie comes in from the back.) <br>
MAGPIE: What do you think you're doing? <br>
DOCTOR: I want my friend restored, and I think that's beyond a little
backstreet electrician, so tell me, who's really in charge here? <br>
WIRE: Yoo hoo! I think that must be me. Ooh, this one's smart as paint.
<br>
BISHOP: Is she talking to us? <br>
MAGPIE: I'm sorry, gentlemen, I'm afraid you've brought this on
yourselves. May I introduce you to my new friend. <br>
WIRE: Jolly nice to meet you. <br>
BISHOP: Oh my God, it's her, that woman off the telly. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's just using her image. <br>
TOMMY: What? What are you? <br>
WIRE: I'm the Wire, and I will gobble you up, pretty boy. Every last
morsel. And when I have feasted, I shall regain the corporeal body,
which my fellow kind denied me. <br>
(The black and white image transforms.) <br>
BISHOP: Good Lord. Colour television! <br>
DOCTOR: So your own people tried to stop you? <br>
WIRE: They executed me. But I escaped in this form and fled across the
stars. <br>
DOCTOR: And now you're trapped in the television. <br>
WIRE: Not for much longer. <br>
TOMMY: Doctor, is this what got my Gran? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Tommy. It feeds off the electrical activity of the brain,
but it gorges itself like a great overfed pig, taking people's faces,
their essences. It stuffs itself. <br>
BISHOP: And you let her do it, Magpie. <br>
MAGPIE: I had to. She allowed me my face. She's promised to release me
at the time of manifestation. <br>
TOMMY: What does that mean? <br>
WIRE: The appointed time. My crowning glory. <br>
BISHOP: Doctor, the coronation! <br>
DOCTOR: For the first time in history, millions gathered around a
television set. But you're not strong enough yet, are you? You can't do
it all from here. That's why you need this. You need something more
powerful! This will turn a big transmitter into a big receiver. <br>
WIRE: What a clever thing you are! But why fret about it? Why not just
relax? Kick off your shoes and enjoy the Coronation. Believe me, you'll
be glued to the screen. <br>
(Energy lances out at them.) <br>
BISHOP: Doctor! <br>
WIRE: Hungry! Hungry! The Wire is hungry! Ah, this one is tasty. Oh,
I'll have lashings of him! Delicious! <br>
(The Doctor starts to finger the sonic screwdriver.) <br>
WIRE: Ah! Armed. He's armed and clever. Withdraw! Withdraw! <br>
(The three men collapse.) <br>
WIRE: The box, Magpie! The box! <br>
(Bishop's face is blank. Magpie grabs the portable.) <br>
WIRE: Hold tight. <br>
(The Wire zaps herself into the portable television.) <br>
WIRE: Conduct me to my victory, Magpie.

DOCTOR: It's never too late, as a wise person once said. Kylie, I
think. The Wire's got big plans. It'll need. Yes, yes, yes, it's got to
harvest half the population. Millions and millions of people and where
are we? <br>
TOMMY: Muswell Hill. <br>
DOCTOR: Muswell Hill. Muswell Hill! Which means Alexandra Palace,
biggest TV transmitter in North London. Oh, that's why it chose this
place. Tommy? <br>

out from the top of the mast to all the nearby aerials. It starts to
suck off the happy faces of the viewers in the Connelly household.) <br>

DOCTOR: Exactly. <br>
ROSE: Will it, that thing, is it trapped for good on video? <br>
DOCTOR: Hope so. Just to be on the safe side though, I'll use my
