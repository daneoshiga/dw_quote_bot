SHAPP: The fleet is still trying to locate the target, sir. <br>
MARSHAL The target, Major Shapp, is Zeos! The planet. Isn't that big
enough? <br>
SHAPP: The navigation systems are being blocked, sir. The Zeons must be
using a new device. The whole fleet's flying blind. <br>
MARSHAL: Or have they all turned cowards? I want this attack pressed
home, Shapp, before the Zeons smash us to pieces. Is that clear? <br>

MARSHAL: Too dangerous. <br>
ASTRA: The hospital's been hit! <br>
MARSHAL So has everywhere else, your Highness. We're under nuclear
attack. <br>
ASTRA: How much longer are you going on with this futile war? Atrios is
being destroyed around us. We must negotiate before it's too late. We
must have peace. <br>
MARSHAL: You don't beg for peace, Princess. You win it! Our
counterattack is already underway. When it has succeeded, we shall have
victory within our grasp. Then we shall have peace. <br>
ASTRA: But don't you understand? We shall all be wiped out if we go on,
Zeons and Atrions alike. <br>
MARSHAL: I understand only my duty. And my duty as Marshal of Atrios is
to prosecute this war to a successful conclusion. Yours is to uphold
the people's morale and give them comfort. <br>
ASTRA: Then let me go to the hospital. I can't do anything here. <br>
MARSHAL: What's the situation, Shapp? Is this raid over? <br>
SHAPP: Yes, sir, at least for the moment. <br>

ASTRA: I'll go on trying, but none of our messages seem to get through.

MERAK: Jammed from here? <br>
ASTRA: No. <br>
MERAK: Because if they were, it would mean the Marshal suspects us. <br>
ASTRA: No, it's not that. He'd have arrested us. I sent the last

him.) <br>

bordering on insane. <br>

situation you must always believe the best until you find out exactly
what the situation's all about, then believe the worst. <br>

all? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't be ridiculous, it always is. Isn't it, K9? <br>

SHAPP: Who are they? What do they want? <br>
MARSHAL: Precisely what I intend to find out before I execute them.
Bring in Merak. <br>
MERAK: Marshal, I've got a hundred patients waiting. <br>
MARSHAL: Then they'll have to wait. Do you know these people? <br>
MERAK: No, should I? <br>
MARSHAL: I think you do. I think they are your accomplices. <br>
MERAK: What? <br>
MARSHAL: Zeon spies and saboteurs. <br>
MERAK: What's that got to do with me? <br>
MARSHAL: Princess Astra is missing. She was last seen with you. Since
then, her escort has been found dead. <br>
MERAK: We must find her. Are you searching for her? <br>
MARSHAL: Everything possible is being done. Now Merak, I know you don't
agree with my conduct of this war. <br>
MERAK: I don't agree with war, nor does Astra. <br>
MARSHAL: I think it's possible that you might have been foolish enough,
misled no doubt by the noblest of motives, to cooperate with the enemy.
Am I right? <br>
MERAK: No, Marshal, you're wrong. <br>
MARSHAL: It would be much better for you to admit everything. I
arrested these two myself, standing over the body of the Princess's
escort. <br>
DOCTOR: I told you, we're not even armed. Look, nothing, just a
whistle. Care for a blow? Go on. <br>
(The Marshal takes the Doctor's dog whistle.) <br>
MARSHAL: Shapp. <br>
(Shapp blows the whistle. They hear nothing, of course.) <br>
MARSHAL: Bah, it's useless. Don't play the fool with me. <br>
(The Marshal drops the whistle and the Doctor picks it up again.) <br>
MARSHAL: What is the purpose of your visit? <br>
DOCTOR: Tourism. <br>
MARSHAL: In the middle of a nuclear war? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I run this small agency, you see. Trips to
battlefields future and past. How civilisations died. It's very
profitable. Isn't it very profitable, Romana? <br>
ROMANA: Oh, absolutely. It's very educational. <br>
MARSHAL: For the last time, what are you doing here? <br>
DOCTOR: Looking for a key. <br>
(Inside K block, a piece of the wall slides back and something lights
up in an alcove near the feverish Princess Astra. Meanwhile, K9 is
homing in on the source of the dog whistle.) <br>
MARSHAL: Everything you've told me is obviously a pack of lies. It's
clear to me that you are Zeon spies. You've murdered one of my guards,
abducted the Princess Astra, no doubt with the collusion of Surgeon
Merak here. Unless you divulge her whereabouts, you will be executed
immediately as spies. Now is that clear? <br>
DOCTOR: Beautifully put, I thought. <br>
MARSHAL: Well? <br>
(The Doctor looks round and sees K9 entering.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, I don't think we can help you. <br>
MARSHAL: Is that your last word? <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
ROMANA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I sincerely hope not, but I think we've been here long
enough. <br>
MARSHAL: Stay where you are! <br>
DOCTOR: Listen, we tell you the truth and you don't believe us. You
accuse us of crimes we haven't committed, and now you're going to have
us shot. I think after a long journey that's a bit too much, Marshal.
K9, lights! <br>
(K9 shoots the light out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Marshal. Come on. <br>
MARSHAL: Stop them! Stop them!

ROMANA: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: Why would the Marshal want to get rid of Astra? <br>
MERAK: The Marshal? What makes you think he's involved? <br>
DOCTOR: Too many coincidences. Well? <br>
MERAK: Astra and I were trying to make contact with the Zeons to try
and make peace. The Marshal knows. He wants the war to go on, of
course. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course. <br>
MERAK: How much longer? <br>
K9: Twelve point two three seconds. <br>
MERAK: Well, I knew I was in danger, but I thought Astra was safe. The
Marshal always said that he needed her support, her influence with the

get out? <br>

moved the guard's body. On the other hand. <br>
ROMANA: On the other hand what? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, on the other hand, anything's possible. Well almost.
Merak, a recycling shaft? Recycling what, exactly? <br>

down the shaft to be recycled in the furnaces. Why? <br>

efficient and energy saving, and it would stop the Zeons wanting to
come here. Introduce an element of iatrophobia? <br>

couldn't reach her. <br>
MERAK: Why not? <br>
DOCTOR: Because I think that Astra's on Zeos. <br>
ROMANA: Doctor, you're forgetting something. We haven't been able to
locate Zeos, not from the Tardis or from anywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Zeos is there all right, it's just you can't see it. <br>
ROMANA: Why not? <br>
(The Doctor moves a step back and puts his hand in front of his face.) <br>
DOCTOR: Can you see me now? <br>
ROMANA: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
ROMANA: Because your hand's in. Oh, you mean there's something between
us and Zeos. <br>
DOCTOR: Right. <br>
ROMANA: That would account for the orbital shift. But why can't we see
whatever's in the way? <br>
DOCTOR: Because it's absorbing the light or energy. Or else it's
camouflaged. <br>
ROMANA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Maybe it's large, or perhaps its small. <br>
ROMANA: How can you be so sure? <br>
DOCTOR: How could Columbus be so sure. <br>
ROMANA: Who? <br>
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. <br>
MERAK: But Astra said that she couldn't get a signal back from Zeos.
Where do we start? <br>
DOCTOR: Behind that mirror over there. There's bound to be another
entrance. You and Romana go over there and see what you can find. <br>
ROMANA: Right. <br>
(Merak and Romana stroll over to the mirror alcove.) <br>
MARSHAL: Reinforcements! <br>
SHAPP: There aren't any, sir. <br>
MARSHAL: Deploy the reserves! <br>
SHAPP: I already have, sir. <br>
MARSHAL: Then we're defenceless. <br>
SHAPP: Yes, sir. We've thrown everything we can at them and still they
keep coming. <br>
MAN [OC]: Fire in section seven. <br>
MARSHAL: This could be the last battle, Shapp. <br>
MAN [OC]: No response, level three. <br>
SHAPP: Yes, sir. <br>

MARSHAL: Where's that Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Here. <br>
(The Doctor is reading printouts.) <br>
MAN [OC]: No response level fourteen. <br>
MARSHAL: Can we have that forcefield now? We've committed everything.
We're being obliterated. We've nothing left. It's our last hope. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. I've worked it all out. <br>
MAN [OC]: Radiation levels <br>
DOCTOR: The problem is energy. If we're using energy to neutralise
mass, which is all a forcefield is, we need enough energy or power
erg-wise to counteract the Zeon bombardment mass-wise <br>
MARSHAL: So, I'll give you absolute energy priority. <br>
DOCTOR: It won't work. Look, K9's worked it all out. <br>
K9: Affirmative. The more you use, the more you need. You'd have to
consume the whole of Atrios to give it an effective forcefield. <br>
DOCTOR: Which rather defeats the purpose. <br>
MARSHAL: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because you wouldn't have a planet to live on. <br>
MARSHAL: Then we are defenceless. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, not quite, not quite. You remember I mentioned a
psychological barrier, a deterrent that no Zeon would cross? <br>
MARSHAL: Yes, but you need Zeons to experiment on. <br>
DOCTOR: No, I think I said examine. <br>
MARSHAL: There are no Zeons. <br>
DOCTOR: There are on Zeos. <br>
MARSHAL: What exactly are you proposing? <br>
DOCTOR: I go to Zeos, pick up a Zeon, and bring the Princess Astra back
if she's there. <br>
ASTRA [on viewscreen]: People of Atrios, lay down your arms. Surrender.
Resistance is useless. The Zeons can never be defeated. They have taken
me captive. My people, my people, they have sworn to destroy Atrios
unless you surrender now. If you love me, my people, save me. Save
yourselves. Hand over the Marshal and surrender. Surrender now. The war
is over. The Zeons <br>
(The Marshal pulls the plug on the viewscreen.) <br>
MARSHAL: This forcefield. Can you provide it now? Will it give us
breathing space? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it'll give you time to save your neck. <br>

Highly efficient, doing very well, giving Atrios a battering, killed
millions without a flicker. Just doing its job. And totally invincible.

Astra is inaccessible. <br>

ASTRA: I got him into the transmat shaft but they were on me before I
could follow. He's safe, though. <br>

enough. Listen, I'll get a fix on the third planet. <br>

for the sixth and final one. Think, Astra, think. <br>

ROMANA: How can we get the sixth piece without using the tracer? Or had
you forgotten the tracer's holding the Key together, and if we take the
tracer out, we break the time loop, and without the time loop millions

Mentalis. Did you by any chance have anything to do with the

the job, wham. Feet never touched the ground. <br>

point by now. <br>
(Steam is coming out of the Key. Mentalis' countdown is running from 10
to 3 before repeating.) <br>
DOCTOR: When the countdown reaches zero, up goes Atrios, Zeos and all. <br>
DRAX: Life presents a dismal picture, you might say. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you might say that. And of course there's the Marshal. <br>
DRAX: The Marshal? He's on our side. <br>
DOCTOR: No. <br>
DRAX: No. Oh well. Where's he fit in? <br>
DOCTOR: He's in the time loop as well, making a rocket attack on Zeos.
Unless, of course, Shapp and Merak get in contact with him. <br>
DRAX: Where are they? <br>
DOCTOR: Back on Atrios, I hope. </font></p>

useless. He either can't or won't answer. And this time loop device
isn't going to hold things back for ever, is it. <br>
MERAK: No, not unless the Doctor can find the sixth piece, and the
sixth piece is somehow connected with Astra. <br>
SHAPP: But she denies all knowledge of it? <br>
MERAK: All conscious knowledge, yes. But if she's the only one who
knows then secret, and if the knowledge is implanted, then it must have
affected her, made her different in some slight way that might just
show up in analysis. <br>

command you. Could I ask you something, sir? <br>
GUARDIAN [on scanner]: Yes, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: It's just that, well, the Key is already assembled, sir. I
mean, couldn't you restore the balances now? <br>
GUARDIAN [on scanner]: Yes, Doctor, but I must have the Key for safe
keeping. It is an awesomely powerful key. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, sir, yes, and mustn't be allowed to fall into the wrong
hands. I quite understand, sir, yes. Key to Time, I command. What about

GUARDIAN [on scanner]: What about it, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I mean, as you know, sir, the sixth segment was in fact a
