field, with a smudge of lipstick on his face. He appears to be rather
dizzy. A man in evening dress walks up to him.) <br>
GUARD: It's a beautiful day. <br>

handkerchief.)

(A woman strides along in a evening dress and ridiculously high heels.
She shoots out a door lock with a small pistol and enters a small
strong room. She then converts the pistol into an acetylene torch and
cuts into the surface of a box.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(12,000 years later. The Doctor is commenting on
the labelling of the various exhibits.) <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong. Wrong. Bit right, mostly wrong. I love museums. <br>
AMY: Yeah, great. Can we go to a planet now? Big space ship?
Churchill's bunker? You promised me a planet next. <br>
DOCTOR: Amy, this isn't any old asteroid. It's the Delerium Archive,
the final resting place of the headless monks. The biggest museum
ever.&nbsp;<br>
AMY: You've got a time machine. What do you need museums for? <br>
DOCTOR: Wrong. Very wrong. Ooo, one of mine. Also one of mine. <br>
AMY: Oh, I see. It's how you keep score. <br>
(The Doctor is very taken by a square box in a case.) <br>
AMY: Oh great, an old box. <br>
DOCTOR: It's from one of the old starliners. A Home Box. <br>
AMY: What's a Home Box? <br>
DOCTOR: Like a black box on a plane, except it homes. Anything happens
to the ship, the Home Box flies home with all the flight data. <br>
AMY: So? <br>
DOCTOR: The writing, the graffiti. Old High Gallifreyan. The lost
language of the Time Lords. <br>
(Which, we discover, is what the woman was burning into the surface of
the box
12,000 years ago.) <br>
DOCTOR: There were days, there were many days, these words could burn
stars and raise up empires, and topple gods. <br>
AMY: What does it say? <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, sweetie. <br>
(Back in the past, River Song winks at a security camera. In the
present, an alarm is sounding and guards are chasing the Doctor and Amy
back to the Tardis.)

DOCTOR: Because someone on a spaceship twelve thousand years ago is
trying to attract my attention. Let's see if we can get the security

at the camera.) <br>

you all know what's down there? Any of you? Because I'll tell you
something. This ship won't reach its destination. <br>

want to find something to hang on to. <br>
(River is standing in front of an airlock. She blows a kiss and it
opens. Alistair and his guards hang onto rails as River is sucked out,
backwards. The Tardis materialises in her flight path.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Whoo! <br>
(He opens the door, holds out his hand and River Song comes sailing in.
She lands on top of him.) <br>
AMY: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: River? <br>
RIVER: Follow that ship. <br>
(So they do.) <br>
RIVER: They've gone into warp drive. We're losing them. Stay close. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm trying. <br>
RIVER: Use the stabilisers. <br>
DOCTOR: There aren't any stabilisers. <br>
RIVER: The blue switches. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, the blue ones don't do anything, they're just blue. <br>
RIVER: Yes, they're blue. Look, they're the blue stabilisers. <br>
(She presses them and the Tardis stops shaking.) <br>
RIVER: See? <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah. Well, it's just boring now, isn't it? They're boring-ers.
They're blue boring-ers. <br>
AMY: Doctor, how come she can fly the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: You call that flying the Tardis? Ha! <br>
RIVER: Okay. I've mapped the probability vectors, done a fold-back on
the temporal isometry, charted the ship to its destination, and parked
us right along side. <br>
DOCTOR: Parked us? We haven't landed. <br>
RIVER: Of course we've landed. I just landed her. <br>
DOCTOR: But, it didn't make the noise. <br>
RIVER: What noise? <br>
DOCTOR: You know, the (wheezing). <br>
RIVER: It's not supposed to make that noise. You leave the brakes on. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Come
along, Pond. Let's have a look. <br>
RIVER: No, wait. Environment checks. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, sorry. Quite right. Environment checks. <br>
(The Doctor opens the Tardis door and looks out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Nice out. <br>
RIVER: We're somewhere in the Garn Belt. There's an atmosphere. Early
indications suggest that <br>
DOCTOR: We're on Alfava Metraxis, the seventh planet of the Dundra
System.
Oxygen rich atmosphere, all toxins in the soft band, eleven hour day
and chances of rain later. <br>
RIVER: He thinks he's so hot when he does that. <br>
AMY: How come you can fly the Tardis? <br>
RIVER: Oh, I had lessons from the very best. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, yeah. <br>
RIVER: It's a shame you were busy that day. Right then, why did they
land here? <br>
DOCTOR: They didn't land. <br>
RIVER: Sorry? <br>
DOCTOR: You should've checked the Home Box. It crashed. <br>
(River leaves.) <br>
AMY: Explain Who is that and how did she do that museum thing? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a long story and I don't know most of it. Off we go. <br>
AMY: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: Leaving. She's got where she wants to go, let's go where we
want to go. <br>
AMY: Are you basically running away? <br>
DOCTOR: Yep. <br>
AMY: Why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because she's the future. My future. <br>
AMY: Can you run away from that? <br>
DOCTOR: I can run away from anything I like. Time is not the boss of
me. <br>
AMY: Hang on, is that a planet out there? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, of course it's a planet. <br>
AMY: You promised me a planet. Five minutes? <br>
DOCTOR: Okay, five minutes. <br>
AMY: Yes! <br>
DOCTOR: But that's all, because I'm telling you now, that woman is not
dragging me into anything. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Planet surface]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The once sleek spaceship is a burning wreck
sticking out of a rock-carved building.) <br>
AMY: What caused it to crash? <br>
RIVER: Not me. <br>
DOCTOR: Nah, the airlock would've sealed seconds after you blew it.
According to the Home Box, the warp engines had a phase shift. No
survivors. <br>
RIVER: A phase shift would have to be sabotage. I did warn them. <br>
DOCTOR: About what? <br>
RIVER: Well, at least the building was empty. Aplan temple. Unoccupied
for centuries. <br>
AMY: Aren't you going to introduce us? <br>
DOCTOR: Amy Pond, Professor River Song. <br>
RIVER: Ah, I'm going to be a Professor some day, am I? How exciting.
Spoilers. <br>
AMY: Yeah, but who is she and how did she do that? She just left you a
note in a museum. <br>
RIVER: Two things always guaranteed to show up in a museum. The Home
Box of category four starliner and sooner or later, him. It's how he
keeps score. <br>
AMY: I know. <br>
RIVER: It's hilarious, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm nobody's taxi service. I'm not going to be there to catch
you every time you feel like jumping out of a space ship. <br>
RIVER: And you are so wrong. There's one survivor. There's a thing in
the belly of that ship that can't ever die. Now he's listening. <br>
(River uses her communicator.) <br>
RIVER: You lot in orbit yet? Yeah, I saw it land. I'm at the crash
site. Try and home in on my signal. Doctor, can you sonic me? I need to
boost the signal so we can use it as a beacon. <br>
(He does, grudgingly.) <br>
AMY: Ooo, Doctor, you sonicked her. <br>
RIVER: We have a minute. Shall we? <br>
(She gets out her Tardis-style diary.) <br>
RIVER: Where are we up to? Have we done the Bone Meadows? <br>
AMY: What's the book? <br>
DOCTOR: Stay away from it. <br>
AMY: What is it though? <br>
DOCTOR: Her diary. <br>
RIVER: Our diary. <br>
DOCTOR: Her past, my future. Time travel. We keep meeting in the wrong
order. <br>
(Four small tornadoes kick up the dust and turn into four soldiers.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: You promised me an army, Doctor Song. <br>
RIVER: No, I promised you the equivalent of an army. This is the
Doctor. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Father Octavian, Sir. Bishop, second class. Twenty clerics at
my command. The troops are already in the drop ship and landing
shortly. Doctor Song was helping us with a covert investigation. Has
Doctor Song explained what we're dealing with? <br>
RIVER: Doctor, what do you know of the Weeping Angels? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Camp]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Night had fallen and the rest of the troops have
arrived with their supplies in a small drop ship, like a container
unit. They have set up camp around it.) <br>
OCTAVIAN: The Angel, as far as we know, is still trapped in the ship.
Our mission is to get inside and neutralise it. We can't get through up
top, we'd be too close to the drives. According to this, behind the
cliff face there's a network of catacombs leading right up to the
temple. We can blow through the base of the cliffs, get into the
entrance chamber, then make our way up. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, good. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Good, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: Catacombs. Probably dark ones. Dark catacombs. Great. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Technically, I think it's called a maze of the dead. <br>
DOCTOR: You can stop any time you like. <br>
SOLDIER [OC]: Father Octavian? <br>
OCTAVIAN: Excuse me, sir. <br>
(Octavian leaves.) <br>
AMY: You're letting people call you sir. You never do that. So,
whatever a Weeping Angel is, it's really bad, yeah? <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's interesting. You're still here. Which part of wait
in the Tardis till I tell you it's safe was so confusing? <br>
AMY: Ooo, you are all Mister Grumpy Face today. <br>
DOCTOR: A Weeping Angel, Amy, is the deadliest, most powerful, most
malevolent life form evolution has ever produced, and right now one of
them is trapped inside that wreckage and I'm supposed to climb in after
it with a screwdriver and a torch, and assuming I survive the radiation
long enough and assuming the whole ship doesn't explode in my face, do
something incredibly clever which I haven't actually thought of yet.
That's my day. That's what I'm up to. Any questions? <br>
AMY: Is River Song your wife? Because she's someone from your future,
and the way she talks to you, I've never seen anyone do that. She's
kind of like, you know, heel, boy. She's Mrs Doctor from the future,
isn't she? Is she
going to be your wife one day? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right. I am definitely Mister Grumpy Face today. <br>
(River calls from the drop module. She has changed into combat
fatigues.) <br>
RIVER: Doctor! Doctor? <br>
AMY: Oops. Her indoors. <br>
RIVER: Father Octavian. <br>
AMY: Why do they call him Father? <br>
DOCTOR: He's their Bishop, they're his Clerics. It's the fifty first
Century. The Church has moved on. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A grainy image of a Weeping Angel with its back
towards them is on a monitor on the far wall.) <br>
RIVER: What do you think? It's from the security cameras in the
Byzantium vault. I ripped it when I was on board. Sorry about the
quality. It's four seconds. I've put it on loop. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's an Angel. Hands covering its face. <br>
OCTAVIAN: You've encountered the Angels before. <br>
DOCTOR: Once, on Earth, a long time ago. But those were scavengers,
barely surviving. <br>
AMY: But it's just a statue. <br>
RIVER: It's a statue when you see it. <br>
DOCTOR: Where did it come from? <br>
RIVER: Oh, pulled from the ruins of Razbahan, end of last century. It's
been in private hands ever since. Dormant all that time. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a difference between dormant and patient. <br>
AMY: What's that mean, it's a statue when you see it? <br>
RIVER: The Weeping Angels can only move if they're unseen. So legend
has it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's not legend, it's a quantum lock. In the sight of any
living creature the Angels literally cease to exist. They're just
stone. The ultimate defence mechanism. <br>
AMY: What, being a stone? <br>
DOCTOR: Being a stone until you turn your back. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Camp]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: The hyperdrive would've split on impact.
That whole ship's going to be flooded with drive burn radiation,
cracked electrons, gravity storms. Deadly to almost any living thing. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Deadly to an Angel? <br>
DOCTOR: Dinner to an Angel. The longer we leave it there, the stronger
it will grow. Who built that temple? Are they still around? <br>
RIVER: The Aplans. Indigenous life form. They died out four hundred
years ago. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Two hundred years later, the planet was terraformed.
Currently there are six billion human colonists. <br>
DOCTOR: Whoo! You lot, you're everywhere. You're like rabbits. I'll
never get done saving you. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Sir, if there is a clear and present danger to the local
population <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there is. Bad as it gets. Bishop, lock and load. <br>
OCTAVIAN: Verger, how are we doing with those explosives? Doctor Song,
with me. <br>
RIVER: Two minutes. Sweetie, I need you. <br>
DOCTOR: Sweetie? <br>
AMY: Anybody need me? Nobody? <br>
(Amy goes back into the Module and looks at the image of the Angel on
the monitor. It's face is raised from his hands and starting to look
over its shoulder.) <br>
RIVER: I found this. Definitive work on the Angels. Well, the only one.
Written by a madman. It's barely readable, but I've marked a few
passages. <br>
(The Doctor riffles through the pages of the book.) <br>
DOCTOR: Not bad. Bit slow in the middle. Didn't you hate his
girlfriend? No. No, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. <br>
(He sniffs the book.) <br>
AMY: Doctor Song? Did you have more than one clip of the Angel? <br>
RIVER: No, just the four seconds. <br>
DOCTOR: This book is wrong. What's wrong with this book? It's wrong. <br>
(The Angel is now looking straight at the viewer, hands completely
lowered. The time stamp has moved as far as 00:11:28:04 before jumping
back to 00:11:24:23. When Amy looks at the monitor again, it is closer
to the camera. The module door closes and locks behind her.) <br>
RIVER: It's so strange when you go all baby face. How early is this for
you? <br>
DOCTOR: Very early. <br>
RIVER: So you don't know who I am yet? <br>
DOCTOR: How do you know who I am? I don't always look the same. <br>
RIVER: I've got pictures of all your faces. You never show up in the
right order, though. I need the spotter's guide. <br>
DOCTOR: Pictures. Why aren't there pictures? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Drop ship]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Amy tries turning off the monitor, but it comes
back on again, and again, and again. She moves close to the monitor.) <br>
AMY: But you're just a recording. You can't move. <br>
(She tries to pull out the lead to the monitor. When she looks back up,
the Angel is up close to the camera, but the time stamp is still
running through the same four seconds.) <br>
AMY: Doctor? <br>

Weeping Angels, so why no pictures? Why not show us what to look out
for? <br>

becomes itself an angel.

me your arm. This won't hurt a bit. <br>

it was pretty quick, so that was something. <br>
DOCTOR: If you're dead, how can I be talking to you? <br>

stripped my cerebral cortex from my body and re-animated a version of
my consciousness to communicate with you. Sorry about the confusion. <br>
