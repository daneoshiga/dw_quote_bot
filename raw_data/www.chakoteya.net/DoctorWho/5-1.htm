DOCTOR: There we are. Well, what do you think? <br>
VICTORIA: I don't know. I can't believe it. It's so big. Where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, it's the Tardis. It's my home. At least, it has been for a
considerable number of years. <br>
VICTORIA: What are all these knobs? <br>
DOCTOR: What, these? <br>
JAMIE: Instruments. These are for controlling our flight. <br>
VICTORIA: Flight? <br>
JAMIE: Well, yes. You see, we travel around in here through time and
space. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. Don't laugh. It's true. Your father and
Maxtible were working on the same problem, but I have perfected a
rather special model, which enables me to travel through the universe
of time. <br>
VICTORIA: How can you? I mean, if what you say is true then you must
be, er, well, how old? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if we count in Earth terms, I suppose I must be about
four hundred, yes, about four hundred and fifty years old. Yes, well,
quite. Now, I think Victoria might find that dress a little
impracticable if she's going to join us in our adventures. Jamie, show
her where she can find some new ones, will you? <br>
JAMIE: Aye, right. This way, Victoria. Try to give us a smooth take
off, Doctor? We don't want to frighten her. <br>
(Jamie leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: A smooth take off? A smooth take off! What a nerve! <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Telos]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A simple yet elegant curved space rocket sits on
three spindly legs on the only flat piece of land available. It's only
visible markings are a chequered pattern around it. Up on a nearby
cliff, a there is a dark-skinned man.) <br>
PARRY [OC]: Hey, Toberman! Get that big head down! <br>
(The man walks to the edge of a cliff and looks down at the party in
the gully.) <br>
PARRY: (bearded Welshman, gesturing at him) What's the matter with you?
Have you gone mad? <br>
VINER: (balding man) The fool. Doesn't he realise the danger he's in?
It's nothing to laugh at. None of us knows what's going to happen when
we press that thing, especially in this rarified atmosphere. <br>
PARRY: All right. Viner, no need to get excited. (to the woman) Can't
you keep your servant under control? <br>
KAFTAN: (Middle Eastern) If I wish, I can. <br>
HOPPER: (blond American) Hurry it up, will you, Rogers! I don't know
what you think you're going to find anyway. <br>
PARRY: According to the map reference now, that should be the entrance
to the city of Telos. <br>
HOPPER: I hope you're right, because I want to get out of here. <br>
KLIEG: (German, balding) Let me remind you, Mister Hopper, that you are
being more than well paid for your part in this expedition. <br>
HOPPER: Oh, big deal. <br>
ROGERS: (younger man) Sorry. We had to make it a pretty big one. <br>
PARRY: All right, let's get on with it. We've wasted enough time. <br>
(The group scramble further up the cliff and take cover.) <br>
PARRY: Stand by. Everybody down! <br>
(The remote detonator is activated, and part of the opposite cliff face
is blown away. The group comes out to look.) <br>
PARRY: Oh no. <br>
HOPPER: Well, there you go. You blast yourself one lump of rock and all
you've got is another. <br>
(Professor Parry turns away in disgust, and Rogers looks again at the
rock face.) <br>
ROGERS: No, wait a minute, look! <br>
(To the side of the area they blew up are is a clearly artificial
opening in the cliff.) <br>
HOPPER: Man, you just blew yourself a pair of doors. <br>
(Cheers all round.) <br>
PARRY: Well, come on. What are we waiting for? <br>
(The team hurry up to the entrance, led by Toberman and Kaftan.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tomb]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The entrance is a recessed metallic structure
with double doors in the middle. On either side are images of strange
humanoid creatures with chest plates and helmets with handles.) <br>
KAFTAN: Fifty pounds for the first man to open the doors. <br>
PARRY: Miss Kaftan, I must remind you that I am the leader of this <br>
(An anonymous man walks up to the doors and takes a firm hold of the
handles. He promptly gets electrocuted for his efforts.) <br>
PARRY: What happened? <br>
KLIEG: I don't know. <br>
HOPPER: Well, one thing for sure, he's not going to collect fifty
pounds from you or anybody else. <br>
VINER: Quiet. Quiet a minute. <br>
PARRY: What's it? <br>
(The Tardis is materialising out of sight.) <br>
VINER: It sounded like an engine. Something came down over there behind
that rock. <br>
HOPPER: Okay, Viner, slow down, I'll take care of this. Jim, behind
that rock. <br>
CALLUM: (American) Okay, I've got it. <br>
(As the Americans hide, guns drawn, the Doctor, Victoria and Jamie come
around the side of a scree. Victoria is in a daring knee-length dress.)
<br>
HOPPER: Hold it right there, friend. <br>
DOCTOR: If you put it like that, I certainly will. <br>
CALLUM: Did you hear that, Professor? English. <br>
PARRY: Yes. All right, Hopper. <br>
(Hopper lowers his weapon.) <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
PARRY: Who are you and where do you come from? <br>
HOPPER: And you'd better have a good story. <br>
JAMIE: Maybe you'll not get one. <br>
HOPPER: Listen, fella, we're not playing games. <br>
ROGERS: You'd better listen to him. <br>
DOCTOR: Now what's been happening over here? <br>
(The Doctor goes over to the body.) <br>
KLIEG: He was killed the moment you made your appearance. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, and you think we did it? Oh, no. I can assure you that we
had nothing to do with the death of this man. He appears to have been
electrocuted. Trying to open these doors perhaps? <br>
ROGERS: He seems to know all the answers. <br>
HOPPER: A wise guy. <br>
VINER: I think this fellow must be the member of a rival expedition. <br>
DOCTOR: Expedition? <br>
PARRY: We've tried to keep it a secret. Unsuccessfully now it appears. <br>
VINER: Look at him. Archaeologist written all over him. <br>
DOCTOR: Really? Does it show? <br>
VINER: There, you see? It's impossible to keep a secret in the
scientific world. <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor, what do you mean? <br>
JAMIE: Tell them, Doctor. Go on, tell them. <br>
DOCTOR: No. Not until they tell me what the purpose of their
expedition. <br>
PARRY: This is an archaeological expedition. We're searching the
universe for the last remains of the Cybermen. <br>
JAMIE: Cybermen? You mean to say they came from here? <br>
PARRY: But of course. Telos was their home. This is the entrance to
their city. <br>
VINER: We know they died out many centuries ago. What we don't know is
why they died out. <br>
HOPPER: Callum, Rogers, get him back to the rocket. I'll be with you in
a minute. <br>
CALLUM: Okay. <br>
HOPPER: Well, that's that. Are you coming back to the rocket with me,
Professor? <br>
PARRY: What for? <br>
HOPPER: You're not going on with this, are you? Look I don't know if
these people have anything to do with it or not, but one of my men has
just been killed. You're not paying that kind of money. <br>
PARRY: Yes, I suppose that's quite true. <br>
HOPPER: Yeah, you think it over. Come on, let's go. We'll wait for you
back at the ship. <br>
DOCTOR: The problem, I take it, is to open these doors, right? <br>
KLIEG: Ha, brilliant. <br>
PARRY: That is the problem. <br>
KLIEG: And we would prefer it if you returned to wherever you came
from. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, not very friendly, are they, Doctor? <br>
VICTORIA: Oh yes, do as he says. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid that that became impossible the moment that name was
mentioned. <br>
VICTORIA: What name? <br>
DOCTOR: Cybermen. <br>
VICTORIA: Cybermen? What are they? <br>
VINER: I knew they were here on the same quest. <br>
PARRY: No one would come here for any other reason. <br>
DOCTOR: We must stay. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, Doctor! <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, must we? I don't like the look of those things at all. <br>
DOCTOR: We shall stay and help you with your search. <br>
KLIEG: Perhaps we don't want your help. <br>
DOCTOR: That's just it, you so obviously do. Now I'm sure we can agree.
I can open those doors for you. <br>
KLIEG: It is our problem, and I suggest you take this ridiculous
expedition of yours off this planet. <br>
JAMIE: It seems to me that we've got as much right here as you have. <br>
PARRY: Of course you have. Mister Klieg, must I remind you again that
you do not speak for this expedition? I am it's leader, you and Miss
Kaftan are only here on sufferance. <br>
KLIEG: Thank you. And whose money is paying for the hire of that
rocket? <br>
KAFTAN: Mine! <br>
PARRY: I thought I made it quite clear that your financial support did
not entitle you to a say in the running of this expedition. <br>
KAFTAN: Of course it was quite clear. Was it not, Eric? <br>
KLIEG: Of course. No one questions your leadership. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, good, that's all settled. And now we shall open these
doors. <br>
JAMIE: What? <br>
PARRY: Careful, man! <br>
HAYDON: Hey look out! <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor! <br>
(The Doctor puts his magnetic voltmeter on the handles, checks the
reading and removes it.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's perfectly safe now. <br>
PARRY: You'll be killed! <br>
HAYDON: No, don't touch him! <br>
(The Doctor grabs a handle and pulls but can't move it.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it's beyond my strength. <br>
JAMIE: Let me, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie. <br>
(Jamie can't move them either.) <br>
JAMIE: Aye, well, I've not had much exercise lately. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite. I think here is a gentleman who can open these doors for
us. <br>
KAFTAN: He is my servant. I will not have him risk his life. <br>
PARRY: Surely it was for just such a contingency as this that you
insisted we bring him with us? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there's no danger now. Unless of course he's afraid. <br>
(Toberman steps forward.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, he's not afraid. <br>
(Toberman pulls open the right door then the left. They are about a
foot thick.) <br>
PARRY: Come on. <br>
DOCTOR: No, wait, wait. I would be very careful in there if I were you.
<br>
HAYDON: But why wasn't Toberman killed? Why weren't you killed? <br>
DOCTOR: The poor fellow who died drained all there electricity out of
his body. It's perfectly safe to go in there now. <br>
KLIEG: Come on, then. We're wasting time. Of course. After you,
Professor. <br>
(Parry, Klieg and the party walk inside.) <br>
DOCTOR: But I'd still. I'd still be very careful if I were you. Very
careful indeed! Come on, let's go and join them. Come on, Victoria. <br>
(Victoria stays rooted to the spot.) <br>
DOCTOR: You look very nice in that dress, Victoria. <br>
VICTORIA: Thank you. Don't you think it's a bit <br>
DOCTOR: A bit short? Oh, I shouldn't worry about that. Look at Jamie's.
<br>
JAMIE: Hey, I'll have you know that. Oh, aye. <br>
DOCTOR: Come along. Come along. Let's go and see what the others are
doing, shall we? Come along. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Central chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They walk down a small slope into a clean metal
room. There are banks of instruments below a big dial to our right, a
doorway with a Cyberman image above it ahead, and more instrumentation
to the left.) <br>
VICTORIA: Mercy, just look at this place. <br>
VINER: These controls are of their earlier dynasty. <br>
HAYDON: Not so very early as all that by the look of it. Look, John. <br>
VINER: Yes, I'm quite capable of making my own deductions, thank you. <br>
HAYDON: All right. <br>
(To the left of the main doorway is a large hatch cover.) <br>
KLIEG: Be careful. There might be danger in there. <br>
KAFTAN: Don't worry, with Toberman to guard me. What is more important
is to keep an eye on these strangers. <br>
KLIEG: Well I tried to <br>
KAFTAN: Do not raise your voice. You will achieve nothing by shouting.
You look after the Doctor and I will watch the girl. <br>
KLIEG: And the Scots boy? <br>
KAFTAN: Leave him to Toberman. Ay, Toberman? But you will be careful
and discreet, understand? <br>
TOBERMAN: I understand. <br>
JAMIE: Did you ever seen the like of it Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly. <br>
PARRY: Now that we're all here. Now that we're all here, I think we'd
better take stock of the situation. This appears to be a dead end. The
only way out appears to be through that hatch. <br>
KAFTAN: Are there no doors? <br>
PARRY: No, apart from the entrance. <br>
DOCTOR: And the other two, of course. <br>
VINER: Two other doors? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. One in that section, and one in that section over
there. Activated, I imagine, by this simple logical system over here.
Here we are, I think. <br>
(The Doctor moves levers 6, 4 and 5, there's a beep and a door to the
right of the entrance slides up.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, splendid, splendid. A simple logical gate. <br>
(He does the same with another set of levers and the door opposite the
entrance lifts.) <br>
KLIEG: Doctor, you seem to be very familiar with this place. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, not really. It's all based upon symbolic logic, the same
as you use in computers. The opening mechanism for this door, an OR
gate. you call it. <br>
KLIEG: Yes, yes, I can see that, but how did you know in the first
place? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I use my own special technique. <br>
KLIEG: Oh really, Doctor? And may we know what that is? <br>
DOCTOR: Keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut. <br>
PARRY: We're far too many to explore together. I think we'd better
divide up. If you, Mister Viner would take that door with er <br>
JAMIE: Jamie. <br>
PARRY: Jamie and Mister Haydon. Mister Klieg, the Doctor and myself
will make up the other party. <br>
VICTORIA: Well, what about us? <br>
PARRY: I think the women had better remain here. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, rubbish. We can make a party. <br>
KAFTAN: Certainly. With Toberman to guard us we need fear no one. <br>
PARRY: Right. Mister Klieg, will you take them along with you? <br>
KLIEG: I prefer to stay here. <br>
PARRY: As you wish. Mister Viner, will you go along with the women? <br>
VINER: If you like. <br>
PARRY: But get back to the spacecraft by 1630. You all know the
temperature drop at night, so we'll meet back here at 1625. If anyone
is missing that'll give us an hour to look for them before we have to
leave. <br>
VINER: Come on, then. we might as well try that opening over there. <br>
KAFTAN: We'd better keep close together. <br>
VICTORIA: I'm all right thank you. <br>
(They go through the central doorway.) <br>
HAYDON: Come on, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Right. <br>
(Haydon and Jamie take the right hand door.) <br>
PARRY: Now to concentrate on this, whatever it is. This hatch must lead
somewhere and there must be some opening mechanism. What was that about
symbolic logic? Any ideas? <br>
DOCTOR: No, not really. I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg a
chance to show off his archaeological skills? I love to see the experts
at work, don't you?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Projector room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The central door has led to a room full of
equipment. It is dominated by a contraption with three projectors.) <br>
VINER: Come on. Right in. Where's Toberman? <br>
KAFTAN: I sent him to join the others. We do not need any other
protection now that you are with us. <br>
VINER: Yes, well, shall we commence? Everything must be carefully
measured and recorded. <br>
VICTORIA: What is this room? <br>
VINER: I don't know. Possibly this is where the Cybermen are made. <br>
VICTORIA: I wonder what this is. <br>
VINER: Do you mind? You're getting in my way. Just go over there, will
you? <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, fiddle! <br>
KAFTAN: Could this not be the purpose of the room? <br>
VINER: Yes? <br>
KAFTAN: A Cyberman would stand in that form and be, well, revitalised? <br>
(There is a large Cyberman-shaped recess opposite the projector.) <br>
VINER: Yes, that's reasonable. These projectors were probably made to
fire in neuro-electric potential. Yes, that's it, I think you're right.
<br>
VICTORIA: Revitalising is just what I need. <br>
(Victoria tries to step into the recess, but the leg slots are too long
for her.) <br>
VICTORIA: Oh mercy, the Cybermen must have been giants. <br>
VINER: Will you please be careful. The first rule of archaeological
work is that nothing must be touched until its been described and
recorded.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> JAMIE: Hey, you know, it's just struck me. All the
corridors in here are as light as day, yet there are no windows. <br>
HAYDON: Alpha-meson phosphor. <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
HAYDON: It's a lighting system that never goes out. Works by letting
cosmic rays bombard a layer of barium. <br>
JAMIE: Oh aye, that. <br>
HAYDON: Point is, what was this room used for? <br>
JAMIE: Well, possibly for raising caterpillars, like this one. <br>
HAYDON: Hey, for heavens sake watch out until we know what it is. <br>
JAMIE: Och, it's as dead as a stone. <br>

and little antennae.)

numbers as the indicator finger swings to and fro.) <br>
PARRY: Well? <br>
KLIEG: Well, the basis of this code is binary to digital conversion
with a intervening step involving a sort of Whitehead logic. <br>
Well, when this Burrier series is complete, there is no more to be
done. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, but why do it at all? <br>
PARRY: Really, Doctor, for an archaeologist you seem to be curiously
lacking in curiosity. <br>
DOCTOR: Some things are better left undone, and I have a feeling that
this is one of them. <br>
KLIEG: What do you mean by that? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's all too easy, isn't it? <br>
KLIEG: Easy? <br>
PARRY: I wouldn't call this an easy survey, would you, Klieg? <br>
KLIEG: Everything here is designed to keep their secrets, whatever they
are, insoluble. <br>
DOCTOR: Insoluble? <br>
KLIEG: But take this <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't say that. <br>
KLIEG: But take this mathematical sequence, for example. I'm really no
nearer to it's solution. I've tried every possible combination. You'd
hardly call that easy! <br>
(The Doctor reads Klieg's notebook.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, what you've done here is mostly right. <br>
KLIEG: Why, thank you. <br>
DOCTOR: You see, if you take any progressive series it can be converted
into binary notation. If you take the sum of the integrants, and
express the result as a power series, then the indices show the basic
binary blocks. Only I wouldn't do it if I were you. Oh no, I really
wouldn't do it! <br>
KLIEG: Of course. You're right. <br>
(Klieg goes to the row of levers below the dial and starts moving
them.) <br>
KLIEG: Look! Sum between limits of one and nine one integral into power
series. Yes! yes! Then you differentiate <br>
(There is a sound of increasing power generation. The lights start to
flicker.) <br>
DOCTOR: You fool! Why couldn't you leave it alone! <br>
PARRY: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know. Perhaps the Cybermen aren't quite as dormant as
you imagine. We must find out what has happened to the others.

goes to a control panel and pulls a lever. The lid of the recess closes
as Victoria screams.) <br>
VINER: Did you touch anything? <br>
KAFTAN: No! <br>

(Kaftan is about to move another lever.) <br>
KAFTAN: One moment. <br>
VINER: Now! <br>

HAYDON: You're seeing things, old chap! Come and look at this. The
whole control panel is active suddenly. I don't know which button to

JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't touch it if I were you. <br>

her with her. <br>
KAFTAN: Yes, but hurry. <br>

to the row of levers and moves another one. The Doctor enters as the
projectors move up and down.) <br>

might get hurt. <br>

HAYDON: Are you all right? <br>
JAMIE: Oh, where have I been? <br>
HAYDON: You've been under some form of hypnosis. <br>
JAMIE: That's ridiculous. What would the Cybermen want with a
hypnotising machine? <br>
HAYDON: Yes, you're right. It must be for something else. Wait a
minute. Know what it could be? <br>
JAMIE: What? <br>
HAYDON: Some kind of target. I remember reading about this somewhere.
They used to have something like it on Earth years ago. <br>
JAMIE: How does it work? Which bit do you aim at? <br>
HAYDON: There's a subliminal centre which you're trained to see. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, aye. A what? <br>

But keep your eyes off the wall. Now you work the controls this time

all their records. If we can't get down there, all our work here and

pressed that button and pulled this lever and then that lever there. <br>
PARRY: Doctor, could you spare us a moment? I. Haydon! What's happened?

VINER: He's dead. Don't you see, he's dead? It's this damn building.
It's alive. It's watching us! It'll get us all! We've got to leave! <br>
PARRY: All right, Viner. This is terrible. How did it happen? <br>
VINER: We've got to get out this building. It's deadly! They'll kill

VINER: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Poor Haydon was looking at that screen, in the direction we all
were, right? <br>

DOCTOR: It's not so obvious when you consider he was shot in the back. <br>
JAMIE: In the back? <br>
PARRY: Are you sure, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: See for yourself. Now if the Cybermen didn't shoot him, what
did? The answer, I think, lies over here. Jamie? <br>

DOCTOR: Maybe. I don't know. Now, Jamie, when you're ready. <br>
JAMIE: Anytime, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Now there is a distinct element of risk in what I'm asking you
all to do, so if anyone wishes to leave they must do so at once. Not
you, Jamie. <br>
VINER: Can't you stop this? He'll kill us all. <br>
DOCTOR: Not if you go back against that wall, in that corner there.
Now, please. Right, Jamie. <br>
(Jamie pulls two levers and presses the big button. The figure of eight
pattern appears on the wall and the Cyberman slides out in front of it.
The weapon comes out of the opposite wall and this time the Cyberman is
decapitated. Victoria screams. The Doctor ducks under the weapon's
turret to examine it.) <br>
JAMIE: Careful, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. I think. I think it's all right now. Yes. You
see, it's just a mock up, a model. No, don't touch that. That gun may
be wired up too. <br>
PARRY: It's a trap. <br>
DOCTOR: No I don't think so. I think it's a testing room for weapons.
This is a purely robotic Cyberman. There's no human material in it at
all. He's a target for weapons. <br>
PARRY: Let's get back to the control room with this poor fellow. <br>
VICTORIA: What's that? <br>
JAMIE: Some wee creature I found on the floor there. <br>
(Victoria picks it up.) <br>
VICTORIA: It's a fossil. <br>
DOCTOR: Victoria, be careful. Let me see that. <br>
(The Doctor takes the metal creature.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's certainly inactive, but it's not a fossil. Wait a
minute. <br>
(The Doctor takes out a notebook.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, here we are. Yes, it's a Cybermat. <br>

PARRY: This directly concerns my expedition. You will kindly take your
place. Right, I'll come straight to the point. I have reluctantly
decided to abandon the expedition and return to Earth. <br>
(General consternation.) <br>
PARRY: I feel as strongly about it as you. This expedition has been my
dream for many years. But there were those like Mister Viner who said
that more preparation was needed, more men and equipment. I refused to
heed their warnings and the result is that two men have died. I'm
sorry, but we must leave at the first available conjunction. We'll take
back all we can for further study, of course, but that is my decision
and that is what we must do. <br>
KLIEG: I insist that <br>
PARRY: My decision is final! We leave when the north hemisphere is
properly tangential, which will be at eighteen forty two. Ah, Captain
Hopper. Just the man. Can you be ready to blast off at eighteen forty
two? <br>
HOPPER: No. <br>
PARRY: I beg your pardon? Did I hear you right? You are paid to take
orders, Captain Hopper. <br>
HOPPER: Not impossible ones, I'm not. It's the fuel pumps. Some
character has balled up the lot. <br>
DOCTOR: Or something. <br>
HOPPER: Well, whatever it is, it's practically wrecked our chances of
getting off this crummy planet. <br>
(A little later, discussions have been on-going.) <br>
VINER: I don't care what any of you say. I utterly refuse. I will not
spend the night on this planet. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think we've got much choice. <br>
VINER: Well, at least we can get out of this sinister building. I've
recorded all the necessary details, I suggest we all go back to the
rocket. <br>
HOPPER: You make a very bad suggestion, Viner, you know that? <br>
VINER: I insist. <br>
HOPPER: You do a lot of insisting. Well, I'm going to tell you
something now. The first guy that set sets foot in my rocketship is
going to stop the repair work just like that. <br>
PARRY: How long will it take to get the rocket operational again? <br>
HOPPER: Working non-stop without interruption, maybe seventy two hours.
<br>
PARRY: Seventy two hours! <br>
VINER: But that's impossible! We'd all be out of our minds after three
days in this place. We must go back on board. <br>
HOPPER: Now look, I can't afford to waste any more time with you guys,
but I'll give it to you just once more, all right? Now you may not know
this but we practically have to pull that ship apart to fix the damage.
And there just isn't room for all of you on board. Especially with you
insisting all over the place. No room to work, got it? <br>
PARRY: Yes, of course. I see now. <br>
VINER: It's all right for you. Have you any idea what it's like in this
deadly building? <br>
HOPPER: Well it's not exactly peaches back on the ship. <br>
DOCTOR: Captain, you do have another reason for not wanting them back
on the ship, don't you? <br>
HOPPER: Yeah. Until I find who broke into that rocket. <br>
DOCTOR: Or what? <br>
HOPPER: Who broke into the rocket. Until then I'm going to keep a round
the clock guard on it. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. <br>
HOPPER: I'm going to get off this place with my skin still fitting
tight all over, all right? <br>
DOCTOR: All right. <br>
HOPPER: Now, in case it gets cold at night, I've brought these anoraks
and some food. I'll let you know when I'm ready to take off. <br>

KLIEG: As we have to stay, we might as well finish our job and fully
explore down there. That is, if the Professor has no objection. <br>
PARRY: We have no alternative. it seems. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, but can't we stay here? It seems a pleasant enough room
to me. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, you speak for yourself. <br>

DOCTOR: Oh yes, I was forgetting. I can, can't I. <br>

JAMIE: Yes, well, let the Doctor past. <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. Your colleague has very strong hands. <br>
KAFTAN: Very strong. <br>
DOCTOR: Enough to do a good deal of damage if let loose in the right
place. <br>
(Kaftan gestures Toberman to let the Doctor past.) <br>
PARRY: There's no doubt about it, the major workings lie below. There
are metal caverns down there, all interconnected. If only we can get
down into them. <br>
KLIEG: That's it! I've got it! Finally, a Boolean function of symbolic
logic. <br>
DOCTOR: Logical, yes, but <br>
KAFTAN: Everything yields to logic. Our basic assumption, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Really. <br>
KLIEG: Six, cap, B four, if and only if, C is cap function of two A. <br>
(Klieg adjusts the main controls, pulls a lever, and nothing happens.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think perhaps your logic is wearing a little thin. <br>
KLIEG: I must have made a mistake. I'll do it again more carefully.
Six, cap, B four, if and only if, C is cap function of, ah, that's it,
two F not two A. <br>

below.) <br>

DOCTOR: Congratulations. <br>
JAMIE: Yeah, but Doctor, you <br>

shall all need to put on warm clothing. Mister Viner, will you see
about the anoraks? <br>
KLIEG: Just a moment. Are we all going down? <br>
PARRY: There is safety in numbers. <br>
KLIEG: The women as well? <br>
PARRY: Oh, they of course will stay up here. In case of trouble,
contact the rocket. <br>

DOCTOR: Keep an eye on (points at Kaftan) things. Please? <br>
VICTORIA: All right. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
PARRY: Well, if we're all ready, I shall lead the descent. Be ready to
go back the instant I give the word. <br>
KLIEG: You know what to do. <br>
KAFTAN: The hatch? <br>
(The Doctor puts on his cape.) <br>
DOCTOR: Mister Toberman? <br>
KAFTAN: He stays with me. <br>
DOCTOR: Then I stay here too. <br>
KAFTAN: Of course, I am being selfish. His strength will be useful to
you down there. He must go down. Go down, Toberman. <br>
(Toberman walks up the steps to the hatch, followed by the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Remember what I said. Be very careful. <br>
(The men disappear down through the hatchway.) <br>
KAFTAN: It seems we are to be left alone to wait. Captain Hopper
brought some food from the rocket. You would like some? <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, rather. I'm ravenous. <br>

KAFTAN: Roast beef? Roast veal? Chicken? <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, chicken, please <br>

VICTORIA: What on Earth's this? <br>
KAFTAN: What you have asked for. Chicken. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KLIEG [OC]: I wish to speak to the Controller! <br>
CONTROLLER: The humanoids must first be destroyed. You will re-enter
cells to conserve energy. <br>
CYBERMAN: He is now prepared. <br>
CONTROLLER: Release him. <br>
(Toberman sits up, staring at nothing and with a metal-looking arm. The
Cybermen climb back into their tombs and seal themselves up again.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KLIEG: They're coming. And now, gentlemen, you
will see how I shall use the power of the Cybermen. <br>
DOCTOR: Use maybe, but you'll never control the Cybermen. <br>
KAFTAN: Eric, behind you! <br>
KLIEG: Stop. You know what this can do to you. <br>
(The Controller stands at the top of the ladder with Toberman behind
him.) <br>
KLIEG: That's better. Now you are under my control. We know you must be
revitalised or you will perish. If you agree to my terms, I shall let
you survive. <br>
CONTROLLER: I will listen. <br>
KAFTAN: Make them release Toberman. <br>
JAMIE: If you think they'll listen to you, you're even dafter than I
thought. <br>
KLIEG: Silence. Sit down. First, you release our man. <br>
(The Controller's brain send energy into Toberman's head. Toberman
walks out of the hatchway, not looking where he is putting his feet.) <br>
KAFTAN: Toberman, it is good that you are back. Watch them. <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, he seems er <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, yes. <br>
(The Controller is coming down the steps.) <br>
KLIEG: Stay where you are! Now, do you agree to accept our plan? <br>
DOCTOR: Plan? <br>
KLIEG: The conquest of the Earth. <br>
PARRY: What? You must be out of your mind. <br>
KLIEG: Silence! Your answer? <br>
CONTROLLER: We accept. We will give you some of our power devices. <br>
KLIEG: Good. I knew an understanding could be reached. I shall let you
be revitalised. To survive, it must be now. Come forward. Slowly. <br>
KAFTAN: Eric, be careful. <br>
KLIEG: Leave this to me. <br>
(The Controller goes to the door to the power room.) <br>
PARRY: You're absolutely crazy to trust them! <br>
KLIEG: Do you think so? Then perhaps you and your colleagues had better
join him. Go on, go on! <br>
KLIEG: The girl stays with us! <br>
DOCTOR: No! <br>
KLIEG: Any trouble, she is our hostage. <br>
(Klieg closes the door to the power room on them.) <br>
KLIEG: Close the hatch. <br>
(Toberman doesn't move.) <br>
KAFTAN: Go on, close it. <br>
(Toberman still doesn't move so Kaftan does it herself.)

shaped recess where Victoria got herself trapped.) <br>
JAMIE: He's too weak to get in. <br>
DOCTOR: Quiet, Jamie. <br>
(The Doctor goes over to the Controller.) <br>
DOCTOR: You seem to be in trouble. <br>
CONTROLLER: The energy levels are low. We will survive. You will help
us. You will help us. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, certainly. Jamie, Professor. <br>
JAMIE: You don't mean to say you're actually going to help them? <br>
PARRY: Surely not? You can't support these creatures. <br>
DOCTOR: I think it best. Come on. Come along. <br>
(They help the Controller into the recess.) <br>
DOCTOR: That's it. Up and in. <br>
CONTROLLER: (winding down) Do you understand the machine? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. One moment. <br>
JAMIE: Have you taken leave of your senses? Now let's go and help
Victoria. <br>
DOCTOR: In a moment, Jamie. Now, are you ready? <br>
(The projector head swings up and down and the recess door closes on
the Controller.) <br>
CONTROLLER: We will survive. We will sur <br>
DOCTOR: Now then, where would you rather have him, in or out of there? <br>
JAMIE: Oh, I see what you mean. <br>
DOCTOR: Only we must make sure that he stays in there.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Victoria has put Callum's arm in a sling.) <br>
VICTORIA: Do you really believe you can bargain with those terrible
Cybermen? <br>
KAFTAN: That is our concern, not yours. <br>
VICTORIA: I'm talking to him, not you. <br>
KLIEG: They will have to agree to our plan. <br>
VICTORIA: What about the other weapon? <br>
KLIEG: What other weapon? <br>
VICTORIA: Well, I saw another one like that in that room over there. <br>
KLIEG: Is that true? <br>
KAFTAN: I don't know. We'd better make sure. <br>
KLIEG: No, wait. That means that any one of them in there could <br>
KAFTAN: Yes, you're right, Eric. <br>
KLIEG: Better wait here. If the Cyberman is aroused, we shall be ready
for him. Now stay well clear. Take no chances. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The recess lid has been tied down. The projector
head is still swinging up and down, and has started to overheat.) <br>
PARRY: Keep back, it's smoking. <br>
JAMIE: I told you we shouldn't have touched it. <br>
PARRY: Yes, turn it off. It's out of control. <br>
(The projector stops.) <br>
PARRY: It's taken over. <br>
DOCTOR: I think not. I think there must be some sort of internal timing
mechanism. Jamie, I hope you made those ropes secure. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, the King of the beasties himself couldnae get out of that
one. <br>
DOCTOR: Good! <br>
(So the re-energised Controller punches his way out easily.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots sometime. <br>
CONTROLLER: You will remain still. <br>
(The Controller transmits strong energy waves through the walls to
Toberman.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Central chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KLIEG: Stay here and watch that door. At least now
we will have some warning. <br>
CALLUM: What do you two hope to gain from all this? <br>
KLIEG: That does not concern you. <br>
(Klieg puts the Cybergun down on the table.) <br>
KAFTAN: Oh, they might as well know, Eric. We are going to build a
better world. <br>
CALLUM: Better? Well, who for? <br>
(Toberman approaches Klieg.) <br>
KLIEG: I told you to watch that door. <br>
(Toberman hits Klieg with his cyberarm.) <br>
KAFTAN: Toberman! <br>
(The Doctor, Jamie, Parry and the Controller enter. It picks up the
Cybergun.) <br>
JAMIE: Victoria! <br>
VICTORIA: What's going on? <br>
CONTROLLER: You have done well. <br>
KAFTAN: Toberman! <br>
CONTROLLER: Silence. He is now under our control. Open the tombs. <br>
KAFTAN: No. You have broken your promise. <br>
CONTROLLER: Cybermen do not promise. Such ideas have no value. Open. <br>
KAFTAN: No. <br>
(The Controller looks as if he is going to shoot Kaftan, but opens the
hatch instead. As it walks away, Kaftan shuts it again and gets a gun
from her bag. She fires.) <br>
CONTROLLER: That gun will not harm me. <br>
(Kaftan fires again and the Controller kills her. Then it opens the
hatch again. The Doctor goes over to Toberman. The Controller calls
down the hatchway.) <br>
DOCTOR: Look what they've done. You're not like them. You're a man like
us. You must help us! He has killed Kaftan! You must help us. <br>
CONTROLLER: You will report to the surface. <br>
(Toberman attacks the Controller, and it drops the Cybergun for Jamie
to pick up as they struggle. Then Toberman lifts the Controller over
his head and throws it onto the control panel in a shower of sparks.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, the hatch! <br>
(A Cyberman is climbing up the ladder.) <br>
DOCTOR: The gun, Jamie! <br>
(Jamie shoots the Cyberman and it expires in a cloud of smoke. He
pushes its remains down the ladder.)&nbsp;<br>
JAMIE: There's another one, Doctor! <br>
(Jamie fires down the ladder.) <br>
DOCTOR: Are there any more? <br>
JAMIE: No, it's gone quiet. I'll close the hatch. <br>
DOCTOR: No, wait a minute. I'd better go down there. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, no, no, not again. <br>
DOCTOR: It's the only way to make sure. <br>
JAMIE: Then I'll go with you. <br>
DOCTOR: No, wait. You stay and look after Victoria. I'll take somebody
else. <br>
(Toberman is cradling Kaftan's body.) <br>
DOCTOR: Toberman, you see what these creatures have done to you?
They've tried to make you like them. Do you understand? They've tried
to make you their slave. They just want to use you. They are evil.
Think of Kaftan. <br>
TOBERMAN: Evil! <br>
DOCTOR: They must be destroyed, do you see? Evil must be destroyed,
Now, come! <br>
TOBERMAN: Destroy! <br>
DOCTOR: Come! Come on! Come on! <br>
(Klieg pretends to be unconscious as the Doctor leads Toberman to the
hatch then lets him go first.) <br>
PARRY: Good luck. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. <br>
JAMIE: Doctor, the gun. <br>
DOCTOR: I shan't need that. <br>
(The Doctor goes down the ladder.) <br>
JAMIE: He should have taken it. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, poor Mister Callum. How are you feeling? <br>
CALLUM: I can't move my arm. I can't move it. <br>
(Klieg takes the Cybergun and goes down the hatch while everyone is
with Callum.)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Move quietly. They're all dormant, see. <br>
TOBERMAN: Evil! <br>
(Toberman hits a piece of equipment.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! Quietly. They're only asleep. They're not frozen yet. Now,
you watch them. I have things to do. Now, let me see. <br>
(The Doctor presses some buttons.) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
(The Doctor pulls levers.)&nbsp;<br>
KLIEG: The cryostat! You're freezing them! <br>
DOCTOR: Klieg! <br>
(Klieg reverses the levers.) <br>
DOCTOR: No! No! You'll wake them up! <br>
KLIEG: That is exactly my intention. You still don't understand, do
you? Their Controller is dead. Now I shall control them. They'll do
what I say. You see, Doctor, yours is the privilege to witness for the
first time the union between mass power and my absolute intelligence.
Who's that? Come out. Come out or I shall kill this man. <br>
(Jamie enters.) <br>
KLIEG: It's you. Over to that wall, all of you. All of you! Now. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, as you say, such a combination between intelligence and
power would make you formidable indeed. Why you'd be commander of the
universe with your brilliance! It makes the imagination reel with the
possibilities! <br>
KLIEG: Why, Doctor, if I had only known you shared my imagination, you
might even have worked for me. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps it's not too late? <br>
JAMIE: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, don't you see? <br>
(The Cybermen are waking but Klieg has his back to them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you see what this is going to all mean to all the people
who come to serve Klieg the All Powerful? Why, no country, no person
would dare to have a single thought that was not your own. Eric Klieg's
own conception of the, of the way of life! <br>
KLIEG: Brilliant! Yes, yes, you're right. Master of the world. <br>
DOCTOR: Well now I know you're mad. I just wanted to make sure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HOPPER: Well, the fuel system's okay. We can blast
off any time. <br>
PARRY: All right. <br>
HOPPER: Hey, what gives? Well, where is everybody? <br>
PARRY: Down there. And so are Klieg and the Cybermen. <br>
HOPPER: Well, I hope they know what they're doing. I've been down there
once and I don't reckon to go again. <br>
VICTORIA: That's all right, Captain. It's comforting to know that we
have your superior strength to call on, should we need it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Cavern]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KLIEG: And so you have forfeited your right to
survival. I shall make an example of you to all who question my
intelligence, and the supreme power of the Cybermen. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, I've heard all this before somewhere. <br>
JAMIE: You know your trouble? You talk too much. <br>
KLIEG: Oh, you're stupid. You still think that your puny minds can
survive against us? You're decadent, weak. Do you know that? Weak! <br>
DOCTOR: All right. Go ahead, kill us. <br>
KLIEG: No, I have a better idea. Much better idea. I shall leave you to
the Cybermen. I'm sure they'll have some use for you. Or parts of you. <br>
(A Cyberman grabs Klieg and beats him to death, then goes to the
control panel. Toberman tackles him.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quick Jamie. These two levers together. <br>
JAMIE: I can't shift this one. <br>
DOCTOR: What? You've got to trip that first. <br>
(The Cyberman and Toberman are evenly matched. Finally Toberman gets it
on its back and smashes open the chest unit. Foam oozes out.) <br>
DOCTOR: Last time they were frozen for five centuries. This time it
must be forever. <br>
(The Doctor and Jamie leave as the remaining Cybermen finish sealing
themselves in their tombs and the ice covers the cavern walls again.)

DOCTOR: Here we are, Victoria, safe and sound. Close the hatch. <br>
(The hatch closes.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we are. Now then. Now, the best thing about a machine
that makes sense, you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. <br>
(The Doctor adjusts the wiring in the main panel that Callum had
opened.)<br>
DOCTOR: There we are. Now I think you'd better all go outside. <br>
PARRY: Why, what are you going to do, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm going to re-electrify the main doors. <br>
PARRY: Yes? <br>
DOCTOR: Only this time I'm going to include the hatch and the control
panel. <br>
PARRY: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Anyone touching any of them will get a considerable shock. In
fact, a fatal one. <br>
PARRY: I see. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, everyone outside. And please take him with you, I shall be
glad to see him outside. <br>
VICTORIA: Jamie? <br>
JAMIE: No, I'll stay with the Doctor. <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, all right. <br>
(Everyone leaves as the Controller's hand moves.) <br>
DOCTOR: There we are. That's done. Now, we just have to close the main
doors and the circuit is complete. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, thank goodness for that. <br>

JAMIE: Doctor. Doctor! <br>
(The Controller is back on its feet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie, you go that way, I'll go this way. That way will give us
more of a chance. When I say run, run. <br>

main doors with the Doctor right behind.)

DOCTOR: We'll get a shock. We must find something to insulate. I know,
that shoring timber over there! Hurry up! Hurry up, he's coming! <br>
(Jamie comes back with the wood to push the doors shut as a Cybermat
scuttles out between their feet.) <br>
JAMIE: Okay, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Quickly! We must keep him inside or else all our work'll be
wasted. <br>
JAMIE: I can't hold mine. Come on! <br>

Controller trying to push the doors open.) <br>
