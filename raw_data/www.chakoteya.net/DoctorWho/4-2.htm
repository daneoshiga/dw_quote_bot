<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Zeus 4 probe blasts off from Earth, it's two
man crew on a routine atmospheric testing flight. The spacecraft is
tracked from the underground control room of Snowcap Base at the South
Pole. Here the team of international scientists and technicians is led
by a physicist, Doctor Barclay, although the base itself is under the
military command of General Cutler, an American who takes his orders
directly from Geneva HQ.) <br>
GENEVA [OC]: Handing Zeus 4 to Polar base. Will you take control now,
please? <br>
CUTLER: We have Zeus 4. Thank you, Geneva. <br>
DYSON: (bald) Snowcap to Zeus 4. Over to local control channel J for
Jimmy. <br>
WILLIAMS [OC]: Over to J for Jimmy now. <br>
CUTLER: Good morning gentlemen. You lucky devils. Have a nice trip. <br>
SCHULTZ [OC]: (Australian) Why not come up and join us? <br>
CUTLER: The penguins might miss me. Take over, will you, Barclay? <br>
(Barclay is bespectacled and bearded.) <br>
BARCLAY: Sir. Dyson, give Texas Tracking the next orbital pattern, will
you? <br>
DYSON: Right, will do. <br>
BARCLAY: Snowcap to Zeus 4. Morning, Blue, morning, Glyn. How do you
read me? <br>
SCHULTZ [OC]: Loud and clear, Snowcap, loud and clear. Hey, we have a
great view of your weather. How is it your end? <br>
BARCLAY: There's a blizzard and an eight force wind. Repeat your
velocity for ground check please. </font></p>

WILLIAMS: (African American) Williams coming in. Cosmic management is
now complete. Are you ready to receive data? <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Go ahead. <br>
WILLIAMS: Okay, Bluey, let him have it. Are you receiving it? <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes, A one okay.

undress, a young Italian private is reading a comic book and singing La
Donna E Mobile. His American sergeant is peering into a periscope) <br>
SERGEANT: Man, it's blowing like crazy out there. All I can see is
snow, snow and more snow. <br>
(On the surface, the blocky periscope protrudes a metre or so up out of
the freezing ground, not far from the squat chimneys, aerials and
access hatches that are the only external evidence of the base. As the
periscope tracks slowly round, it misses the sight of a blue police box
materialising a short distance away.)

hat)&nbsp;<br>
POLLY: Hey Doctor, you've got the most fantastic wardrobe. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well I'm glad you approve, my child. <br>
POLLY: These are gorgeous. Where do you shop, Carnaby Street? <br>
BEN: Who do you think you are, Nanook of the North or something? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh now, now, now. Stop being so flippant. We don't know what
we're in for outside there. Now come along, come along, come along. <br>
POLLY: There you are, Doctor. Are you sure you're going to be warm
enough? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, like toast my dear. Now, did you find everything you want? <br>
POLLY: Yes, thanks. <br>

coldest place on earth. I'm freezing already. <br>
BEN: Yeah. <br>
POLLY: Hey, what's this? <br>
BEN: Well, watch it Polly. <br>
POLLY: It's some kind of an aerial. There must be something buried
underneath here. Hey, look over there. There's something moving. <br>
BEN: Don't touch it, Polly. It looks like some kind of periscope. <br>
POLLY: Is there some kind of a submarine or something down there?

disbelief.) <br>

TITO: Sure, sure, lots of people. <br>
SERGEANT: And there's a woman. <br>
TITO: A woman. A woman? Hey! <br>
(Everyone pays attention.) <br>
TITO: Come on. (looks through the periscope) Hey, hey! Mama Mia.
Bellissima. <br>
(He's looking straight at Polly. The Sergeant takes the periscope back
and moves it around to see the Tardis.) <br>
SERGEANT: Looks looks like some kind of a hut. Quick, take those small
arms. Get upstairs and get bring them down. Get moving! </font></p>

on, pops, will you move it? Will you move it, pops? Let's go, come on! <br>
DOCTOR: Please stop that. Please, please stop that. <br>
SERGEANT: Just a moment, pops. Now, who are you, and what are you doing
here? <br>
POLLY: Oh, we just landed outside. <br>
SERGEANT: What in? <br>
POLLY: Well it's a sort of spaceship actually. <br>
TITO: Ha ha! Some spaceship, boss! <br>
SERGEANT: You can knock off the jokes. <br>
BEN: She's not joking. <br>
SERGEANT: Look buddy, I want the truth, and quick. <br>
DOCTOR: Can you tell us precisely where we are, please? <br>
SERGEANT: You're at the South Pole base of International Space Command,

DOCTOR: Doctor. <br>
SERGEANT: Doctor, your story's gonna have to be awful good. <br>
POLLY: So you mean we are on Earth? <br>
BEN: Well you heard, the South Pole. <br>
SERGEANT: Oh boy. Tito, get the CO. <br>
TITO: He's a-not going to like it. <br>
SERGEANT: Get him! <br>
DOCTOR: Why don't you speak up, I'm deaf! (sotto) Who's the CO? <br>
BEN: The Commanding Officer, the boss. <br>
(Tito gets on the telephone.) <br>
TITO: Hallo, sir? Private Tito, duty guard here. Could you give a
message to the General please? <br>
BEN: General? <br>
SERGEANT: General Cutler, the CO. <br>
TITO: Sir? I know, but this is an emergency! What's that? The General's
not there? Well can-a you tell me where he is then? <br>
CUTLER: Right here, Private. What is it, Sergeant? <br>
SERGEANT: Ah, well, sir. <br>
CUTLER: Who are these people? <br>
SERGEANT: Well sir, they just appeared outside. <br>
CUTLER: What? <br>
SERGEANT: Yes, sir, as I said they just appeared. From a hut. <br>
CUTLER: A hut? <br>
SERGEANT: Yes, sir. Never been there before. <br>
TITO: That's a-right General. That's just the way it happened. <br>
CUTLER: Well? Who are you? <br>
BEN: Able seaman Ben Jackson, sir, Royal Navy. <br>
CUTLER: Then why aren't you with your ship? <br>
BEN: That's a bit difficult to explain, sir. <br>
CUTLER: Yeah, I'll bet my sweet life it is. <br>
DOCTOR: We don't intend you any harm, General, I can assure you of
that. <br>
CUTLER: You can assure me of what you like but whether I'll believe you
or not is another question. I haven't got time to deal with these now,
but when I do you'd better have a good explanation. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't like your tone, sir. <br>
CUTLER: And I don't like your face, nor your hair. Sergeant, bring them
into Tracking and put them under guard in the Observation room. I'll
deal with them as soon as I have time. <br>

Tito and his prisoners. The Doctor, Ben and Polly are shepherded
through the room into the adjoining observation area.) <br>
TITO: OK, come on, move, avanti, avanti, svarro. <br>
CUTLER: All right, all right. Don't sit there like a lot of frustrated
penguins. Get on with it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> POLLY: Hey, isn't it smashing. It looks just like
that rocket place in America. <br>
BEN: Yeah, but I wonder why there are so few people. I mean it's not
like what you see on the telly, is it? <br>
SERGEANT: I don't know what you see on your TV, son, but this is
General Cutler's outfit. Come on, you'd better take a seat. <br>
(Ben and Polly sit down.) <br>
SERGEANT: He don't like a lot of personnel. Cuts down to the bare
minimum and works them right into the ground. We only spend a couple of
months on this station anyway. We can't stand more than that. <br>
(The travellers take off their coats.) <br>
POLLY: I see. Hey, perhaps we can catch a lift back to England. <br>
BEN: Oh, I can't see the squire there giving us a free lift anywhere. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I don't want to depress you both but I'm afraid we're not
quite where you think we are. <br>
BEN: What do you mean? <br>
POLLY: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, just take a peek at that. <br>
(A calendar on the wall shows December 1986.) <br>
POLLY: 1986! Oh no, and I thought we'd be able to get home. <br>
BEN: Yeah, we're still at sea. Here, but that'll explain the few
people. Them computers must do all the work now. Here, I wonder if they
got to the moon yet. <br>
SERGEANT: Sure, don't you listen to the news? <br>
BEN: You mean you have sent people to the moon? <br>
SERGEANT: Yeah, an expedition just returned. <br>
POLLY: Well, what's this flight then? <br>
SERGEANT: Oh, this is just a normal atmosphere testing probe. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. A rocket testing site. <br>
(The Sergeant presses the intercom button.) <br>
SERGEANT: Hey, what's that? <br>

Island New Zealand and reading a height of 1100 miles. <br>
BARCLAY: 1100? But that's impossible! Dyson, check what it should be,
will you? <br>
DYSON: It should be 980. <br>
BARCLAY: No, it can't be. Let me try. <br>
DYSON: Let me do it. <br>
BARCLAY: No, you're right. 980 miles? They're out of position by more
than a hundred miles! <br>
DYSON: Looks like it. <br>
BARCLAY: Snowcap to Zeus 4. Can you read me? <br>
WILLIAMS [OC]: Zeus 4 to Snowcap. Strength 8, over. <br>
BARCLAY: Take visual checks on Mars to establish position. Report back.

SCHULTZ: No. It's 4-3-2. <br>
WILLIAMS: It can't be. Try again. <br>
SCHULTZ: I am. <br>
WILLIAMS: Come on, shake it up. We'll be back in sunrise in a bit. <br>
SCHULTZ: Cut it out, Glyn. <br>
WILLIAMS: Did you read conversation? <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes. We're getting a Mars fix too. Call back. <br>
SCHULTZ: Hey, Glyn? <br>
WILLIAMS: Yeah? <br>
SCHULTZ: Well, er, take it easy but, er <br>
WILLIAMS: Come on, come on, what is it? <br>
SCHULTZ: It wasn't Mars I had. <br>
WILLIAMS: Well that explains it, doesn't it. Come on now, Dan, try
again. <br>
SCHULTZ: No, listen, Glyn, there's something else out there. <br>
WILLIAMS: What do you mean? <br>
SCHULTZ: There's another planet out there! <br>
WILLIAMS: Another planet? <br>
SCHULTZ: Yeah. <br>
WILLIAMS: Yeah, you're right. There is something. I can't see properly
but it reads as if it was in orbit between Mars and Venus. <br>
SCHULTZ: Yeah, that's it. Funny how I can't put me finger on it but it
looks kinda familiar. <br>
WILLIAMS: Yeah. <br>
SCHULTZ: Came the dawn. <br>
WILLIAMS: Yeah. Well, I guess we've had enough Earth observations for a
bit. Hello Snowcap. Hello Snowcap. We're now in dawn over San
Francisco. Can you get the subject from where you are? <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Snowcap to Zeus 4. You are very faint. Put up your power
output please. <br>
WILLIAMS: It is up. <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Reading you strength 3. Come in, please. <br>
WILLIAMS: Repeat, can you get the subject on your retina scope? <br>
BARCLAY [OC]: Can do. <br>

DYSON: Barclay. It's not very clear but it's a planet all right. <br>
CUTLER: How could it be? Planets don't just appear. <br>
BARCLAY: It must be on an oblique orbit. <br>
DYSON: It's approaching quite fast. Barclay, couldn't it be <br>
BARCLAY: I know what you're thinking. Zeus 4 is out of orbit and a new
planet has appeared. Therefore the new planet is influencing Zeus 4.
Right? <br>
DYSON: That's about it. <br>
BARCLAY: We must get them down. <br>

bottom.) <br>
CUTLER: Nonsense, how could there be? <br>
BARCLAY: This is unbelievable. That's surely Africa? <br>

CUTLER [OC]: Yes sir, there's no doubt at all. <br>
WIGNER: Very well. Just a moment please. Get on to Mount Palomar. Ask
them to provide us with a picture as soon as possible. Contact Jodrell
Bank and ask them to get an exact fix on this. We must have data, and
quickly. Let me know the moment you have any more information, General.

CUTLER: Now just a minute. You turn up out of nowhere, a routine space
shot goes wrong, a new planet appears and you tell us you know all
about it. That puts you slap bang in the hot seat, right? <br>

KRAIL: You will be wondering what has happened. Your astronomers must
have just discovered a new planet. Is that not so? <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, that's right. <br>
KRAIL: That is where we come from. It is called Mondas. <br>
BEN: Mondas? <br>
BARCLAY: Mondas? But isn't that one of the ancient names of Earth? <br>

BARCLAY: Cybermen? <br>
KRAIL: Yes, Cybermen. We were exactly like you once but our cybernetic
scientists realised that our race was getting weak. <br>
BARCLAY: Weak? How? <br>
KRAIL: Our life span was getting shorter, so our scientists and doctors
devised spare parts for our bodies until we could be almost completely
replaced. <br>
POLLY: But that means you're not like us. You're robots! <br>
KRAIL: Our brains are just like yours except that certain weaknesses
have been removed. <br>
BARCLAY: Weaknesses? What weaknesses? <br>
KRAIL: You call them emotions, do you not? <br>
POLLY: But that's terrible. You, you mean you wouldn't care about

of Mondas is too strong. <br>

KRAIL: It is a foregone conclusion. You are wasting time. However, if
you wish to contact them I have no objection. He and his colleagues may

action. Get rid of these things. <br>

learned a very great deal. <br>

Two, another visit from these creatures is almost a certainty. Three,
the Earth is being drained of it's energy by this so-called planet
Mondas or whatever it's called. <br>

We can destroy Mondas. <br>

it could split that planet in half. There are two or three at strategic

CUTLER: That is my order! <br>
BEN: Look, tell him he can't use this bomb, Barclay. We'll all go up

CUTLER: Now, look you. Ever since you came into this base you and that
old man have poked your noses into things that don't concern you. Well,
you've just done it for the last time. You, take them out of here and
lock them up with the Doctor. <br>
POLLY: But just a minute, are you sure there's only one way of dealing
with the Cybermen? <br>
CUTLER: As they are about to attack us, yes, I am sure. <br>
BEN: But there is another way. To wait. <br>
BARCLAY: I don't follow. <br>
BEN: Look, the Doctor said that it's not only Earth that's in danger,
but that Mondas itself is in far greater danger. Otherwise, why have
they bothered coming here? <br>
CUTLER: And just how did he figure that out? It's draining energy from
the Earth, isn't it? <br>
BEN: Yes, but he said eventually it would absorb too much energy and
burn itself out. Well, shrivel up to nothing. So all we've got to do is
wait! <br>
CUTLER: Wait? Sure, wait until these Cybermen friends of yours get here
and take over this planet. Oh no, mister, we're not going to wait.
We're just going to accelerate the process a little. We're going to
make it disappear just a little bit sooner, that's all. <br>
BARCLAY: But don't you see, General? A nuclear explosion on Mondas
would deliver a terrific blast of radiation, enough to destroy all the
life on the side of the Earth that's facing it. It might even turn into
a sun, a sort of supernova. And it would certainly destroy the space
capsule. <br>
CUTLER: That's a risk we'll have to take. So far as the capsule's
concerned, Doctor Barclay, you are going to programme that bomb so that
it hits Mondas at a time when my son's orbit has taken him to the far
side of the Earth. <br>
BARCLAY: But there are no guarantees of success. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BEN: They're coming. Quick! Behind the door. <br>
KRANG [OC]: Your three minutes is up. What is your decision? We shall
be forced to kill you. We will give you one more chance to come out and
give us the bomb. <br>
BEN: Come in and get it! <br>
(The Cybermen start to pump gas into the room.) <br>
BEN: There's something else down by the door. <br>
(Barclay opens the door.) <br>
BEN: Now! <br>
(Ben fires his Cyber-weapon and Jarl falls.) <br>
BARCLAY: I can't hold out much longer! <br>
BEN: Where's Dyson and the other bloke got to?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> KRANG: The humans are behind the door. Let the gas
do its work. <br>
(Haines and Dyson come up behind the Cybermen with the radioactive
rods. The Cybermen collapse and Ben comes out of the room.) <br>
BEN: Quick, Dyson. Help get Barclay out of here. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TECH: What happened, Doctor Barclay? Are you all
right? <br>
BEN: He's all right. Yeah, get in the chair. <br>
DYSON: Back to your desks all of you. The emergency's not over yet.
Philips, there are two reactor rods out in the corridor. See that
they're put back at once. <br>
BEN: Hey, they've still got the Doctor and Polly. <br>
BARCLAY: No, wait! If you try and tackle the spacecrafts on your own,
you don't stand a chance. We don't know how many Cybermen there are
left. <br>
BEN: Well? <br>
BARCLAY: Well, here's one of the things they use to contact each other.
<br>
BEN: I don't know how it works. <br>
BARCLAY: Well then, do anything, make a signal. Draw them here. <br>
DYSON: Is that wise? <br>
BEN: Well, if that spaceship takes off we'll never gonna see them
again. <br>
DYSON: You may bring them all in on us. <br>
BEN: Well that's a risk we've got to take. <br>
(The Cyber comm. unit buzzes.) <br>
BEN: That should do it. Any idea how long it'll take for them to get
here? <br>
DYSON: You stand by with those guns. <br>
BARCLAY: Now look, we must all get down other side of the room. <br>
BEN: Okay. <br>
BARCLAY: Opposite the door so we can face them. Use the guns. <br>
(The lights go out.) <br>
BEN: What now? <br>
DYSON: The emergency battery's running out, I suppose. <br>
BARCLAY: We can't face them in the dark! <br>
DYSON: Now we shall freeze to death. <br>
BARCLAY: They must get those reactor rods back. <br>
BEN: Hang on, they're coming back. <br>
BARCLAY: Ah. <br>
BEN: Look! <br>
BARCLAY: Here they are. <br>
SHAV: Resistance is useless. Drop your weapons. <br>
RADAR: Just look at Mondas, sir. I can't believe it! <br>
DYSON: Fantastic! It looks as if it's melting! <br>
BEN: It's falling to bits! <br>
BARCLAY: The end of Mondas. <br>
BEN: Hey, look! What's happened to them? <br>
BARCLAY: They've disintegrated! <br>
DYSON: They must have been entirely dependent on power from Mondas. <br>
TERRY [on monitor]: Zeus 5 to Snowcap. Are you receiving me. Over? <br>
BARCLAY: Quick, Dyson, get that. <br>
TERRY [on monitor]: Zeus 5 to Snowcap.<br>
DYSON: Snowcap to Zeus 5. Reading you loud and clear. <br>
TERRY [on monitor]: What happened? Where have you been? <br>
BARCLAY: Here, let me have that. Snowcap to Zeus 5, what is your fuel
position? <br>
TERRY: It's okay. Everything's suddenly working normally. And what
about getting me down? <br>
BARCLAY: We've been on emergency power. We'll handle your splashdown as
soon as we get full power back. Start checking the base main units. <br>
DYSON: Yes, right. <br>
BARCLAY: Hello, Geneva? Geneva? <br>
BEN: Hey! The Doctor and Polly! <br>
BARCLAY: Snowcap here. <br>
WIGNER [on monitor]: Hello, Snowcap. Who is that, Barclay? <br>
BARCLAY: Yes, we've just getting full power back. The danger is
apparently over. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BARCLAY: Sir, will do. Did you hear that? He wants

POLLY: Ben! Oh please, Ben, help me. Get me out of this thing! <br>
BEN: All right, don't panic, I'll have you out soon. <br>
POLLY: Ow! My hands were stuck and I couldn't get out. Ben, I've been
so scared. <br>
BEN: Take it easy, love, take it easy. <br>
POLLY: And that Cyberman thing, it just fizzled into nothing, Ben, it
was awful. <br>
BEN: What's the matter with the Doctor? <br>
POLLY: I don't know. When the lights went out, he just seemed to faint.
<br>
BEN: Hey, come on Doctor, wakey wakey! It's all over now. <br>
POLLY: Doctor. <br>
(They help him out of the cage.) <br>
DOCTOR: What did you say, my boy? It's all over. It's all over. That's
what you said. No, but it isn't all over. It's far from being all over.
<br>
BEN: What are you taking about? <br>
DOCTOR: I must get back to the Tardis immediately! <br>
POLLY: All right, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I must go now. <br>
BEN: Aren't we going to go back to say goodbye or anything? <br>
DOCTOR: No. No, I must go at once. <br>
BEN: Oh well, you better have this. We don't want you catching your
death of cold. <br>
(Ben hands the Doctor his cloak.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. Thank you. It's good. Keep warm. <br>
(The Doctor leaves.) <br>
POLLY: What's happened to him? <br>
BEN: Dunno. He seems to lost his sense of humour. <br>
POLLY: Well, I can't wait to get out of this place. <br>
BEN: Good looking guys, aren't they?

summons the effort to open the door for Ben and Polly. Levers are
moving and the central column is moving up and down. The Doctor
collapses.) <br>

BEN: No, leave him. <br>

change to those of a younger dark haired man.) </font> </p>
