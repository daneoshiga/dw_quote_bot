of a swimming pool area with tables and chairs, and statuary in a
shaded colonnade.) <br>
MEL: Look, Doctor, look. There's the swimming pool, right at the very
top of the building. Oh, it's wonderful. I can't wait to have a dip in
that. Paradise Towers, here we come. <br>
DOCTOR: That's the problem with young people today, no spirit of
adventure.

Then a shadow falls across her and she screams.)

DOCTOR: I think that's enough of that, Mel. <br>
MEL: Why? It's great. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if you want to stay here watching a guide book when you
could actually be enjoying the real thing, that's up to you. <br>
MEL: You mean we're nearly there? <br>
DOCTOR: Paradise Towers any second now. <br>
MEL: Fantastic! <br>
DOCTOR: You may want to lie by the pool doing nothing all day. I intend
to explore. Paradise Towers is supposed to be a remarkable
architectural achievement, I'm told. Won all sorts of awards way back
in the er, twenty first century. Are you ready? <br>
MEL: Ready? I can't wait. <br>

MEL: It's just rubbish. <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing's just rubbish if you have an enquiring mind. <br>
MEL: No, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you never can tell. <br>
MEL: You don't happen to know another planet with a swimming pool, do
you? <br>
DOCTOR: Why did I have to jettison the pool from the Tardis? <br>

Griophos, I understand. <br>
MEL: Oh, we could try there. <br>
DOCTOR: Just one snag. <br>
MEL: What's that?&nbsp;<br>
DOCTOR: It's for the exclusive use of the Gulmaris. <br>
MEL: Who are they? <br>
DOCTOR: A rather nasty breed of flesh eating octopi. Personally, I'd
rather stay here and explore. I wonder what happened? <br>
MEL: It's seen better days, that's what's happened. Still, now that
we're here, I suppose I might as well see what the pool's like. <br>
DOCTOR: That's the spirit, Mel. This could be fascinating. Are you
coming? <br>
MEL: Yes, but one thing, Doctor. If anything goes wrong and we get
separated, we'll meet at the pool, all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, very well. But we've only just arrived. There's no need to
start worrying yet. <br>

CARETAKER [OC]: This is the Chief Caretaker speaking. We are receiving
you, Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three.
Make your report. <br>
345/12: Considerable evidence of multi-coloured wall-scrawl all along
this part of street. Wall Scrawlers obviously active here. Over. <br>
CARETAKER [OC]: Report noted. Proceed now to report on corridor five

FIRE ESCAPE: Red Kangs. Red Kangs are best. Who's best? <br>
RED KANGS: Red Kangs, Red Kangs, Red Kangs are best. <br>
BIN LINER: So, who's best? <br>
DOCTOR: The Red Kangs, I gather. There are other colour Kangs? <br>
BIN LINER: Yeah, the Blue Kangs but they're <br>

FIRE ESCAPE: And the Yellows, but they're only one now. <br>

BIN LINER: Just is. <br>
DOCTOR: Not got very enquiring minds, have you? <br>
MEL: Quiet, Doctor. <br>
BIN LINER: Are you a Blue Kang? <br>
(Mel is wearing a mostly blue spotted outfit.) <br>
MEL: No. No, I'm not a Kang. I'm Mel. I don't know what the Kangs are. <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: We're the Kangs. Red Kangs. <br>
DOCTOR: Who are, of course, the best. They seem to be some sort of
gang. All girls, by the looks of it. Perhaps they'll ask you to join
up, Mel. <br>
MEL: I hope not. <br>
BIN LINER: Bin liner. <br>
DOCTOR: Pardon? <br>
BIN LINER: Bin Liner. Mel. Bin Liner. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, now we're getting somewhere. I'm the Doctor. <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: Fire Escape. <br>
DOCTOR: How do you do. <br>

DOCTOR: I was only trying to be friendly. <br>
BIN LINER: Friendly? <br>
DOCTOR: Say hello. Hello? Hello? <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: Ah, he wants to how you do. Do we? <br>
(She steps forward and raises her right hand in a fist, opens it and
pulls it down with her left hand, then repeats with the other hand.
Finally she claps her hands and opens them out, palms towards the
Doctor. He puts his palms on hers. Fire Escape steps back and the Red
Kangs all give a little curtsey and nod. The Doctor goes through the
routine then rolls his hat down his arm and back up onto his head. The
girls curtsey again.) <br>
DOCTOR: You don't have to do that. What about Mel, then? <br>
(The Red Kangs fold their arms and turn away.) <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter? <br>
(Fire Escape goes up to Mel then turns her back.) <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: You we like, Doctor. What you wear is high fabsion and ice
hot, for an old one. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. But clothes don't maketh the man, you
know. <br>
BIN LINER: No, but Kangs all have colours. Blue, yellow, red. What is
Mel's colour? <br>
MEL: Oh, I don't have a colour. And I don't want to be a Kang. <br>

CARETAKER [OC]: What is it now? <br>
345/12: Do I have to? <br>
CARETAKER [OC]: Orders are orders. Number one rule of the Caretakers,
Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve subsection three. <br>
(As 345/12 goes round the corner, a young woman in blue comes out of
hiding behind him. The young man's voice gets fainter as he walks
away.) <br>
345/12 [OC]: Chief, listen. Something's going wrong. I know it's going
wrong. After (unintelligible), can't I just <br>
CARETAKER [OC]: No, Caretaker number three four five stroke twelve

(Once he is out of earshot, the Blue Kang picks up an internal
telephone and dials.) <br>
BLUE KANG: Yellow Kang the last believed unalive. Reason not known. <br>
(She puts the phone back and leaves in the opposite direction to the
young Caretaker. <br>
Elsewhere, the real life item depicted in the stencil the Doctor saw on
the wall is trundling along, vicious screwthread for one arm, circular
saw for the other. It is towing a large rubbish bin with a foot
sticking out of it. The last Yellow Kang has been cleaned up.)

Kangs, Red Kangs are best. Red Kangs, Red Kangs, Red Kangs are best. <br>
DOCTOR: Red Kangs are best. Yes, well, now, that we've been introduced,
I think that some explanations are in order. We're visitors to Paradise
Towers, only just arrived, so you can't really expect Mel to understand
what you're talking about. <br>
BIN LINER: No visitors. <br>
DOCTOR: Pardon? <br>
BIN LINER: No visitors, no ball games, no fly posts, no visitors. <br>
DOCTOR: You mean visitors aren't allowed? <br>
BIN LINER: No visitors ever. <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: Not since time start. <br>
DOCTOR: There's always a first time. I mean, not everyone you're going
to meet's going to be a Kang. <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: No, there are Old Ones, and the Caretakers and the <br>
BIN LINER: Raita! <br>
DOCTOR: And? <br>
BIN LINER: That is all. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And who are these, er, Caretakers?&nbsp;<br>
BIN LINER: They wipe away our wallscrawl, chase us down Carrydoors,
catch us if they can. <br>
DOCTOR: I see. And all the young ones are Kangs. <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Or girls, I should say. There don't seem to be any boys. <br>

FIRE ESCAPE: Boys? Boys? What are boys? There are Old Ones, and the
Caretakers and Kangs and the (Bin Liner gives her a Look). That is all.
<br>
DOCTOR: I see. Well, I must say it's been nice meeting you, but I think
it's time we ought to be on our way&gt; Don't you think so, Mel? <br>
MEL: Yes, Doctor. Not a moment to lose. <br>

DOCTOR: Did you say a whole tribe of Yellow Kangs have been wiped out,
I mean, made unalive, just like that? But why? You didn't kill them,
did you? <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: To make unalive is not part of the Kang way. No ball
games, no fly posts, no wipe-outs. <br>
DOCTOR: Who did it, then? The Caretakers? The Blue Kangs? I mean, who? <br>

CARETAKER: If you deliver me this Doctor, I'll give you a safe way out.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Red Kang Headquarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MEL: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes? <br>
MEL: The door's nearly back in place anyway but they're having trouble
with the fortamolascope opening device. <br>
DOCTOR: I'd better give them a hand. See what you can do to help the
Kangs down there. Oh, and Mel, don't forget to leave the escape hatch
uncovered so that I can make my exit. I just hope that Pex doesn't lose
his nerve and hurry, otherwise it won't be Kroagnon who's caught in a
booby trap, it'll be us.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Fountain of Happiness Square]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Red and Blue Kangs stay out of sight of Pex and
the Caretaker, and their two Cleaner escort.) <br>
CARETAKER: This is not some trick, is it? <br>
PEX: No, no. <br>
KROAGNON: I've only just began to enjoy walking around my marvellous
Towers in this body and I wouldn't deal very kindly with anybody who
was stupid enough to lay a trap for me. Not frightened, are you? <br>
PEX: I, I think we ought to hurry, Great Architect. Please? Let's
hurry. <br>
KROAGNON: As you wish. <br>
(Pex walks on. The Caretaker starts to lurch after him and has a good
look around the apparently deserted Square. Once the Cleaners have
gone, the Blue Kang leader uses the telephone.) <br>
BLUE KANG: They're on their way.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Red Kang Headquarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Bin Liner takes the call.) <br>
MEL: What's happening? <br>
BIN LINER: They're making all speed here. <br>
MEL: What? <br>
BIN LINER: Pex has been a scaredy cat. They'll be here in no time. <br>
DOCTOR: I must tell the Doctor. <br>
BIN LINER: Danger, tripwires. This way. <br>
(Bin Liner leads Mel through the ventilation grill.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside Red Kang Headquarters]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: That should do it. <br>
DEPUTY: Doctor! <br>
(Pex and company are heading towards them.) <br>
DEPUTY: And we're not ready for him. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Pex. Move back, quickly. <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: Oh, but Doctor, he'll make you unalive. <br>
DOCTOR: There's only one way this might work, and for that I need to be
on my own. <br>
MEL: Come on. <br>
(The possessed Chief Caretaker lurches up to the Doctor.) <br>
CARETAKER: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, now, Kroagnon, how nice of you to drop in. I am so glad.
I wanted to have a few words with you about the shoddy design of this
building. I mean, take this door for instance. Look at it. <br>
CARETAKER: There was nothing wrong with it when I built it, unless
humanoid creatures have damaged it. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, speaking as an expert, I'm prepared to tell the universe
you couldn't design a simple doorknob. I mean, look. <br>
(The Caretaker steps right up to the door. The Doctor opens it and
tries to push him through, but fails. The Caretaker knocks the Doctor
across the corridor. Pex turns to run but the two Cleaners are behind
him so he runs past the Doctor towards Mel and the others instead. The
Caretaker picks up the Doctor and beats him against the wall.) <br>
DOCTOR: Pex! Help! <br>
(Pex meets Mel's eyes, then looks at the Kang bracelet.) <br>
DOCTOR: Pex! Pex! <br>
(Pex runs back and pulls the Doctor from the Caretaker's grasp,
unfortunately throwing him into the wall and briefly knocking him out.
Then he launches himself at the Caretaker, who shrugs him off and takes
the bundle of dynamite. Pex head-butts the Caretaker and they both
tumble into the Red Kang Headquarters, triggering the tripwires and
creating the planned big BOOM!)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Fountain of Happiness Square]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Kangs kneel around their monument, Red and
Blue alternate, watched by Rezzies and Caretakers.) <br>
BIN LINER: Hail Pex. Hail the unalive who gave his life for the Towers.
In life he was not a Kang but in death he was brave and bold as a Kang
should be. <br>
KANGS: Hail Pex. Hail the unalive. Hail Pex. Hail the unalive. <br>
MEL: Poor Pex. <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed, poor Pex. But look, Mel, they're all here. The
Caretakers, the Rezzies, the Kangs. This would never have happened
before. Perhaps now they'll all start working together. <br>
(Fire Escape, Bin Liner and the Blue Kang leader join the Doctor and
Mel.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Fire Escape. Now, have you managed to remove the Kang
wallscrawls from the Tardis as you promised? <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: Build high for happiness, Doctor. <br>
(She gives him his umbrella.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. <br>
BLUE KANG: We're sorry you must go, Doctor and Mel. We've made you an
honorary Kang, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, a Blue Kang or a Red Kang? <br>
(The Blue Kang holds out a blue scarf. Fire Escape turns it over to
reveal a red side.) <br>
FIRE ESCAPE: Both. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well I'll be honoured to wear it. And all my best wishes to
the future of Paradise Towers. <br>
(The Doctor and Mel go to the Tardis. The Doctor doffs his hat to the
piece of metal junk standing there.) <br>
DOCTOR: Goodbye. <br>
MEL: No, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well you never can tell. <br>
(They enter the Tardis, and it dematerialises. On the wall behind it is
a new piece of graffiti - crossed blue and red scarves with the words
Pex Lives.) </font> </p>
