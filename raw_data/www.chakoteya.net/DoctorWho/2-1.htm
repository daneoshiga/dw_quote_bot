<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: We're approaching a planet. <br>
IAN: Which one? <br>
DOCTOR: We shall soon see. <br>
BARBARA: Ow! <br>
DOCTOR: What's the matter, my dear? <br>
BARBARA: I've burnt myself. It's hot! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, something overheating here. Just as well we're landing.
Susan, check the fault locator, please. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, Grandfather. <br>
BARBARA: We're not going to blow up or anything, are we? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, of course not. It's just, well, there we were, in
the late eighteenth century and I tried another frequency to side-step
the ship back into the middle of the twentieth century. <br>
SUSAN: There's something on QR18, Grandfather, and A14D. <br>
(A klaxon sounds) <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather! Grandfather! The door's opening! <br>
DOCTOR: What's happening? (frantically flipping switches) Close the
doors, please. We haven't materialised properly. Quickly! <br>
IAN: What do you mean, close the doors? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't argue, dear boy. It's an emergency! Close the doors! <br>
(Susan, Barbara and Ian rush to push the doors shut, and finally
succeed) <br>
BARBARA: Is everything all right? <br>
DOCTOR: We're just landing. <br>
IAN: Are you all right, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
IAN: Are you all right? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, please don't bother me. <br>
BARBARA: What happened just then? <br>
DOCTOR: Susan, go back to the fault locator and I want you to check
everything, child. Do you understand? Everything! <br>
BARBARA: Well, at least we seem to be all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be childish. They opened. The doors opened before we
properly materialised. <br>
IAN: But what does it mean? Look, you needn't keep it a secret from us.
<br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, don't keep us in suspense. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, don't go on with these futile questions, please. Can't you
understand? Can't you see? <br>
IAN: No, we can't. That's just it. <br>
DOCTOR: We were just about to materialise, when the doors opened and we
hadn't properly adjusted. <br>
BARBARA: You mean something went out of the ship? <br>
DOCTOR: No, that's impossible. <br>
IAN: Came inside? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh please, don't keep talking on the twentieth century level.
I'm talking about time travel. Neither of you can understand what I'm
talking about, I can see that. <br>
IAN: How could we? You've never explained it to us. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, I <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, everything's all right. There isn't a fault
anywhere, not even a yellow standby. <br>
DOCTOR: There must be something wrong, Susan. I shall have to check
that fault locator myself to make sure. Excuse me. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, I do wish he wouldn't talk in riddles. <br>
IAN: So do I. Susan, perhaps you can help us. <br>
SUSAN: I just know the most dangerous moment is at the point of
materialisation. <br>
BARBARA: Nothing's ever happened to us before. <br>
SUSAN: Well the doors have never opened like that before. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, happily no harm's been done. It's most puzzling. Oh, my
dear Barbara, was I rude to you just now? If so I'm so sorry. I always
forget the niceties under pressure. Please forgive me. <br>
BARBARA: There's nothing to forgive. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Well, I suppose everything's all right and you see
the temperature there. It's quite safe to go outside. Oh, Susan, just
turn on the scanner and let's try and see where we are. <br>
(The scanner goes bang) <br>
SUSAN: It's shattered! <br>
IAN: Perhaps you need a new tube, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Did you notice the way it blew out? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, it was like an internal explosion of some sort. <br>
DOCTOR: Like something too big for it's frame. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: But yet I don't know, that can't be right. <br>
IAN: What do we do now, Doctor? Take the scanner out and strip it down?
<br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, dear boy. No, it's most puzzling of course, but
now we don't know what's behind those doors. <br>
BARBARA: Well, we must go outside and look. You said it was quite safe.
<br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I wonder why the? Well, we must see. <br>
SUSAN: Shall I open the doors, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, please, Susan. But all of you, cautiously, please. <br>
(Barbara and Susan go out) <br>
IAN: Doctor, what made the doors open before? <br>
DOCTOR: The space pressure was far too great whilst we were
materialising. The strange thing is that we all came out of it
unscathed. It's most puzzling. It's a big mystery, my boy. Come along. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Susan and Barbara are examining something by a
rock face) <br>
SUSAN: It's like a vine or something. <br>
DOCTOR: Now why wouldn't the scanner show us all this, hmm? <br>
IAN: Perhaps that was the only damage to the ship, Doctor. Overloading
on the scanner circuits. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose so. It could be. What a strange rock formation. <br>
IAN: Yes it is, isn't it. <br>
BARBARA: There are two different types of rock. Doctor, look. This is
ordinary stone up here, but this down here seems to be quite different.
<br>
DOCTOR: Chesterton, here, come here. Look here, is that cement? <br>
IAN: It might be. <br>
DOCTOR: Rather a rough kind, isn't it? <br>
IAN: Yes, very rough. They look like pebbles of sand, don't they. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. It's manufactured, anyway, to hold the stone in place. You
know, to fix it firmly beneath. <br>
SUSAN: I'd have thought the stone was heavy enough to keep itself in
place. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's all most odd, isn't it. Most odd. Now, Barbara, I
suggest that you and I take that path and Susan and you, sir, go that
way. <br>
IAN: Yes, all right, but stay within calling distance, and if you see
anything, sing out. We'll do the same. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. <br>
(Ian and Susan go off, then Barbara sees a very strange, large thing on
the rock face) <br>
BARBARA: Doctor! Doctor, it's a huge snake! <br>
DOCTOR: What? A snake? <br>
BARBARA: Let's call the others. <br>
DOCTOR: Wait, wait, wait. Yes, I think it's dead. <br>
BARBARA: That's a fantastic size. <br>
DOCTOR: No eyes, no head. you see. The skin's interesting, isn't it. <br>
BARBARA: Interesting? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a down, you see. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, are you sure it isn't just sleeping? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, it's quite dead. No, no. Death, you see, has
it's own particular posture and appearance. Yes, yes. Let's go a bit
further. <br>
(Meanwhile) <br>
IAN: Warm, isn't it. <br>
SUSAN: Yes. Ian, look at this. <br>
(a large curved object on the ground) <br>
IAN: That's odd. I suppose it couldn't be an egg. Not that size. <br>
SUSAN: There are more of them over there, look. <br>
IAN: Yes. Ostrich? Ought to be rounder than this. <br>
SUSAN: Strange. There are dozens of them over here. There's a whole
pile of them. <br>
(then she comes face to face with a giant insect) <br>
SUSAN: Ian! Ian! It is dead, isn't it? <br>
IAN: Yes. It's dead, all right. Stiff as a poker. What a fantastic
size. <br>
SUSAN: Yes. <br>
IAN: It's a giant ant. <br>
SUSAN: It's a fighter, is he? Looks as though it was trying to carry
these eggs. <br>
IAN: Yes, well, it's natural behaviour for an ant when it's attacked.
Take the eggs to safety. The worker ant'd give his life rather than
abandon the eggs, you know. <br>
SUSAN: Well he couldn't have had much of a chance, could he? I mean, he
must have died quickly. <br>
IAN: Yes. Look at these eggs scattered about. The other ants must have
been frightened away. I wonder what sort of a world could produce an
insect that size. <br>
(further along) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, here we are then. This is the tail end of it, and I know
what it is. It's a huge earthworm. <br>
BARBARA: What? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, there are no earthworms this size on your planet. <br>
BARBARA: You're right, there aren't. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, except for its size, I could swear that it came from
your world. Well, let's go on. Come along. <br>
BARBARA: It's a bit like a maze, really, all these channels. We'd
better be careful not to get lost. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, no, we won't, no, and I'm determined not to go back until
we discover something more definite. At the moment we only have one
phenomenon and this mystery. <br>
BARBARA: What mystery? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, all this maze you're talking about. You know, I admit
it's a bit haphazard, but it seems to have some kind of pattern about
it. And this pattern suggests to me that there's a brain with a purpose
behind it all. Come along. <br>
(elsewhere) <br>
SUSAN: Ian, I counted six of those dead ants. <br>
IAN: Yes, I know. They're all about us, everywhere. Now this is really
baffling. <br>
(It is a massive billboard, or so it seems) <br>
SUSAN: A huge picture of Night-Scented Stock. <br>
IAN: Yes, it is. But why put up a picture of it? I don't get it. The
writing. Seed Company Limited, Norwich. <br>
SUSAN: Norwich! That's England, isn't it? Norfolk. <br>
IAN: Yes, it is. Susan, this means we're on Earth. Something very odd
here. First those ants, now this. I suppose it couldn't be part of a
crazy exhibition. You know, where everything had been increased in
size. <br>
(Meanwhile) <br>
DOCTOR: Well now, this is interesting. This has been cut by a
manufacturer. Look out! <br>
(The piece of timber falls over) <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. Fine. <br>
DOCTOR: That was a near miss. It would have given you a nasty headache.
<br>
SUSAN: Hey, look at the end of that. It's all charred. <br>
DOCTOR: You can see quite clearly what this is. It's a matchstick. <br>
BARBARA: It certainly looks like one. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't just look like one, it is a matchstick. <br>
BARBARA: What, that size? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't you see? That huge earthworm, and now this? Can't you see
what's happened, hmm? <br>
(Back at the flower picture) <br>
IAN: I don't understand this at all, Susan. I'm going to have a look
round the other side of this. <br>
SUSAN: All right. <br>
IAN: Look at this matchbox. (he climbs in) It must be an exhibition,
Susan. Something like the World's Fair, things this size. <br>
SUSAN: No, Ian. <br>
IAN: Well, what else? Look at the scale of things. <br>
SUSAN: You're wrong, Ian. Completely wrong. I thought just now that
something was wrong when I saw that, but now I'm sure. <br>
IAN: All right, what's your theory then? <br>
SUSAN: These things haven't been made bigger. We've been made smaller. <br>
(at the match) <br>
BARBARA: Smaller? <br>
DOCTOR: We have been reduced roughly to the size of an inch. <br>
(matchbox) <br>
IAN: An inch? <br>
(at the match) <br>
DOCTOR: You, me, all of us and the ship. <br>
(Then we are shown that the Tardis is in a gap in the crazy paving of a
garden path) <br>
DOCTOR: We must get hold of the others quickly and return to the
Tardis. <br>
(at the matchbox) <br>
IAN: No, Susan, no. It can't be. <br>
SUSAN: I'm right, Ian. I know I am. That's the danger Grandfather was
afraid of when the doors opened. He wouldn't admit it was possible,
that's all. <br>
IAN: It isn't possible, Susan. It's ridiculous. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, Ian, work it out for yourself. The doors of Tardis opened.
That means the space pressure caused us to reduce. <br>
(It suddenly goes dark and there is a loud noise) <br>
IAN: What's that? <br>
SUSAN: What is it? <br>
IAN: Run, Susan, run! <br>
(A man picks up his briefcase and matchbox and walks to the house. The
light returns) <br>
SUSAN: Ian? Ian, where are you! <br>
BARBARA [OC]: Susan! <br>
SUSAN: Barbara! <br>
BARBARA [OC]: Susan! <br>
SUSAN: Barbara, over here. <br>
(Barbara and the Doctor come around the seed packet) <br>
SUSAN: Oh, Barbara! <br>
BARBARA: Susan, what's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: What's happened? <br>
SUSAN: There was a great big matchbox, a huge one, and Ian and I came
to have a look and he sat on it, and there was this terrible noise and
he fell inside it and now it's gone! It's gone and Ian's inside it! <br>
BARBARA: All right, Susan, it's all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Well someone picked it up, I suppose. <br>
(The owner of the matchbox puts it down, and Ian massages his sore
shoulders) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Edge of paving stone]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SUSAN: We can climb this and see over the top. Oh
Barbara, I can't reach it. <br>
BARBARA: All right, I'll do it. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, now, please, no. Let me do it. You might hurt yourself.
You just let me, hmm. <br>
SUSAN: Be careful, Grandfather. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. <br>
SUSAN: Steady. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm all right. Yes, well it looks a tremendous distance to me.
There's a house over there, and there's a man sitting down, reading
something. It's a notebook, I think. <br>
BARBARA: Did he have a matchbox? <br>
DOCTOR: How do I know? <br>
BARBARA: I don't know how you know, but do you suppose he could have? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose so. Watch what you're doing, will you? <br>
BARBARA: Well, look, Doctor, give us some hope. I mean, Ian's inside
that matchbox. <br>
DOCTOR: Gently, gently, gently. We've got to find Chesterton. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, supposing the man walks off with it? <br>
DOCTOR: Courage, my dear. I know all this is a bit of a nightmare, but
we've just got to get Ian back and then we can go back to the ship. <br>
SUSAN: And then can you get us back to normal size? <br>
DOCTOR: Of course, yes, I'll try. There's always a chance. But first
things first. We must find Chesterton. We can't go back that way. We
must go back the same way that we came. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Patio]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The man is reading a small notebook. Then he
takes a cigarette from a packet and puts it in his mouth. He spots a
cat cleaning itself and calls to it, but it takes no notice of him. He
puts his notebook into the briefcase and is about to pick up his
matchbox when another man offers him a light instead) <br>
FARROW: Oh, hello. Thank you. Mister Forrester, isn't it? We spoke on
the telephone. <br>
FORRESTER: Yes, I got here as quickly as I could. I hope you haven't
taken any action yet. <br>
FARROW: Not yet, but I have written my report. <br>
FORRESTER: You do realise what's at stake here, Mister Farrow? The
early experiments were noted by the Ministry, welcomed in fact. I've
already geared factories, advertising and all the rest of it to start
pushing DN6. <br>
FARROW: I'm sorry about that, but I can't give you the approval that
you want. <br>
FORRESTER: We could of course spend more time on the refining. <br>
FARROW: Oh, there's much more to it than that, as I mentioned to you on
the telephone. <br>
FORRESTER: You want to bring in another expert to go over the tests
again. <br>
FARROW: You're not a scientist, are you. Well, let me put it this way.
On the surface, DN6 appears to have all the characteristics of a major
breakthrough in the manufacture of insecticide. I can quite understand
why you've pinned all your hopes on it, particularly as my own Minister
was so enthusiastic. But the very exhaustive tests I have made show
that DN6 is totally destructive. <br>
FORRESTER: Well, that was the idea, wasn't it? I mean, Smithers says
it'll even prevent locusts from breeding, wipe them out altogether. <br>
FARROW: I don't think I'm making myself quite clear. There are many
insects which make a vital contribution to agriculture, and these
insects must not die. Did you know that? <br>
FORRESTER: Does Smithers know about this? <br>
FARROW: Well, I have expressed my doubts to him, but he's so engrossed
in this venture that I shall have to break the hard facts to him very
gently. <br>
FORRESTER: I see. You're aware, of course, that if it doesn't go into
production I shall be completely ruined. <br>
FARROW: That is very unfortunate, but really you should have waited
until we'd given you the go-ahead. <br>
FORRESTER: Well that's all very well, but it doesn't help me, does it.
Surely we can work something out. There's a fortune to be made out of
this. <br>
FARROW: I don't think I want to go on with this conversation. Really I
shouldn't be seeing you at all, except that I did promise over the
phone that I'd explain the facts to you in person. <br>
FORRESTER: What happens now? <br>
FARROW: Well, officially my holiday commenced yesterday. I've a small
boat down in the harbour and I'm going to make a tour of the rivers of
France. But before I go today, I shall telephone my Ministry and then
post them my report. <br>
&gt; FORRESTER: Couldn't you leave it until you get back from your
holiday? Give me a little grace? <br>
FARROW: Oh, you know I couldn't do that. <br>
FORRESTER: Do you know why I'm a success, Mister Farrow? Because I've
never allowed the word can't to exist. There's always a way. Always. <br>
FARROW: Not this time. This isn't business, this is science. The
formula is unacceptable and I can't, and I do mean can't, Mister
Forrester, allow DN6 to go into production. Now I'll make that phone
call. <br>
(Forrester draws a small pistol) <br>
FORRESTER: Just a moment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (A bee suddenly falls to the ground in front of
the travellers) <br>
BARBARA: Don't move. <br>
DOCTOR: It's not moving. <br>
SUSAN: Don't touch it. <br>
DOCTOR: It's perfectly stiff. <br>
BARBARA: It could still sting. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha! What an awe-inspiring sight. Now what chance would human
beings have, I really wonder, in the world of creatures like this bee,
hmm? <br>
SUSAN: None at all. <br>
DOCTOR: Take a closer look. <br>
SUSAN: Well I haven't taken my eyes off it, Grandfather. It hasn't even
trembled. I think you're right. It is dead. <br>
DOCTOR: It's the same distinctive aroma. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, I've noticed it on all the other dead things. <br>
SUSAN: Well that must be what's killing them, then. <br>
DOCTOR: I wonder what it is that could kill off nature like this. <br>
SUSAN: What worries me is all the different things it's killing. Things
that fly in the air, things that move on the ground, things that move
under the ground. It's so indiscriminate. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, whatever it is that's killing these things, could it
kill us too? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we must presume that it can. So no eating or drinking
until we've done our very best to find Ian, hmm? <br>
(There's a loud noise) <br>
SUSAN: That's not thunder, surely? <br>
DOCTOR: Sounded more like an ancient cannon. </font></p>

BARBARA: Seen a lot more of those dead ants, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Rather wide-spread, I'm afraid. <br>
BARBARA: Oh dear. I wonder what would have happened to us if any of
those creatures had still been alive. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I wonder. I wonder. <br>
(Ian holds up his handkerchief in front of Farrow's nose to check he
isn't breathing. Then we next meet him back with the others) <br>
SUSAN: And you say you saw that man? <br>
IAN: Yes, he's over here. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, not any further, please. I'm exhausted. It's taken us ages
to get here. <br>
DOCTOR: What's that smell? Cordite? Gunpowder, hmm? <br>
IAN: Yes. That would explain the explosion, and also the man. It's not
far. Come on and I'll show you. </font></p>

BARBARA: Are you sure he is dead? <br>
IAN: Oh, yes. <br>
BARBARA: There's nothing but death all around us. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, what's happening here? <br>
DOCTOR: You weren't with us, Chesterton, but every insect we came
across is dead. <br>
IAN: Yes, Susan and I saw a great many huge dead ants. <br>
SUSAN: And everything else is the same here. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and we don't know what it was that killed them. That man,
he's been shot, murdered. <br>
BARBARA: What would kill insects in a perfectly ordinary garden. I
mean, pests one can understand, but surely it's wrong to bees and worms
and things, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Quite so. Both are vital to the growth of things. However, we
must leave this simple mystery and get back to the ship. As I said, my
dear, it's fortunate for all of us that everything is dead. <br>
(Susan turns round and screams) <br>
SUSAN: Argh! Grandfather! <br>
(It's the cat) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <u><i><b>Episode Two -

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IAN: Don't move, any of you. <br>
DOCTOR: And whatever you do, don't look into the cat's eyes. Close your
own if you want to. <br>
IAN: Doctor, I think the cat's losing interest. <br>
DOCTOR: Don't relax. One swipe of its paw would smash us to pieces. <br>
(The cat moves off) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, we can't get back to the ship just yet, and you know how
fast cats can move. And another thing, we could be mistaken for mice
and I don't fancy being part of the cat's diet. <br>
BARBARA: It gets more horrifying every moment. <br>
SUSAN: Couldn't we make contact with the people here somehow? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid not. <br>
SUSAN: Well, why not? They might be able to help us. <br>
DOCTOR: It's out of the question, my dear. How can we possibly
communicate with them? <br>
IAN: Imagine a record played at the wrong speed, Susan. We'd sound like
a little squeak to them and they'd sound like a low growl to us. <br>
BARBARA: Anyway, even if we could communicate, what would they do to
us? We're freaks. They'd put us in a glass case and examine us through
a microscope. <br>
SUSAN: Oh, that's a thought, isn't it. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, and I would add another and more important factor. The
people who live in this house are murderers. Or one of them is.
Therefore we can't expect sympathy and understanding from an insane or
a criminal mind. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, what about that dead man? <br>
BARBARA: Oughtn't we to do something about it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what can we do, my dear? I mean, surely this is the
question. Normally I wouldn't hesitate, but the destruction of the life
force is frightful. There it is. I mean, what can we do as we are? <br>
IAN: Well, I can't see any sign of that cat, for how much safety that
gives us. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, shall we proceed? <br>
(It suddenly goes dark) <br>
IAN: I can see a huge leg coming. Run! <br>
(Barbara trips) <br>
IAN: Oh, Barbara. Go on, Susan. <br>
SUSAN: Let me help you, Ian. <br>
IAN: Go on! <br>
BARBARA: Sorry. <br>
IAN: It's all right. This way, quickly. <br>
(Once again, the four are split up into pairs) <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, they were almost stepped on! <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, they're all right, they're all right. It's a pity they
didn't come this way, though. <br>
SUSAN: Shall we go over to them? <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SMITHERS: You're sure he's dead? <br>
FORRESTER: Of course I'm sure. You know he had a gun. <br>
SMITHERS: He didn't seem the sort of man who'd need one. <br>
FORRESTER: He pulled it out of his pocket and told me he was stealing
the formula. I struggled with him. The gun must have been turned into
his body. It went off. <br>
(Smithers rolls the body over) <br>
SMITHERS: I wouldn't try telling that story to the police, if I were
you. <br>
FORRESTER: Oh? Why not? <br>
SMITHERS: Oh, don't be a fool. He's been shot through the heart from
some feet away. Even I can see that and I'm no expert. No powder burns
around the bullet hole. <br>
FORRESTER: You're very detached about it. <br>
SMITHERS: What did you expect, hysterics? I've seen more death than you
could imagine. People dying of starvation all over the world. What do
you think I started on research for? What puzzles me is how cool you
are. <br>
FORRESTER: I don't feel guilty if that's what you mean. I'm too busy
working out what the implications are. <br>
SMITHERS: Destroying the last year's work. That's what it means. And if
that seems callous, well all right, it is. Farrow was pushed onto me
and he was a nuisance and a fool. Always checking every minor detail.
I've worked fifteen, sometimes sixteen hours a day, every day, on this
experiment. <br>
FORRESTER: Yes, I know. <br>
SMITHERS: You don't know anything! All you care about is how much money
you can make. Why did you have to kill him? Couldn't you have given him
money, bought him off? Oh, what's the use. <br>
FORRESTER: Look, Smithers, I know what you put into the experiment, but
this doesn't mean the end of everything. <br>
SMITHERS: Of course it does. You've ruined everything. It's all
finished, wasted. <br>
FORRESTER: Not necessarily. Farrow was going on a holiday. He has a
boat. He was going to cross to France by himself in it. It's anchored
about ten miles away. <br>
SMITHERS: Yes, I know. <br>
FORRESTER: If the police were to find an overturned boat and a body out
at sea somewhere. <br>
SMITHERS: But <br>
FORRESTER: Don't worry. You can leave it all to me. I'll tow an
outboard with me and come back in that. <br>
SMITHERS: Well that's your business. I don't want to know about it. <br>
FORRESTER: You say all I want out of the experiment is money, but you
want something too, don't you. You want to see it finished, be known as
the inventor of it. If the truth came out about Farrow, you can say
goodbye to all that. <br>
SMITHERS: The experiment must go through! It's too important! Nothing
else matters! Not if we can save people from dying of starvation.
That's what I care about, Forrester. <br>
FORRESTER: All right, we'll move the body. As far as you're concerned,
Farrow left here to go to his boat. I'll put his briefcase in the lab
first. </font></p>

IAN: It's a ceiling up there. That means we're indoors and the Doctor

very lucky. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, but you know what the metal was? <br>

have gone inside the house. Careful, Grandfather. Don't fall down
there, will you. <br>
DOCTOR: Phew. Awful smell of chemical in there. (the downspout) <br>
SUSAN: Phew, yes. It's not just an ordinary drainpipe, is it. <br>
DOCTOR: No. I wonder if that pipe extends into the room where that

SUSAN: Are you thinking of climbing up the inside of it? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course, my dear. There's no other way. If you go
in there you'll see it's all corroded, so there's plenty of hand and
foot holds. That chemical smell means that it's germ-free. <br>
SUSAN: It's too far for you, Grandfather. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, if it is, I shall have to give up, and I'm not going to
give up before I've tried. And remember, you must think of the other

IAN: Hey, Barbara. Look at this. <br>
BARBARA: Give me a handkerchief, will you? <br>
IAN: Do you see what this is? A book of litmus papers. How often have I

BARBARA: Yes. <br>
IAN: You realise what this place is? <br>
BARBARA: Oh, it's some sort of laboratory. <br>
IAN: Yes. I think it must explain those dead insects and things. They
must be doing some experiments. Of course, it makes it all the more
dangerous for us. <br>
BARBARA: Why do you say that? <br>
IAN: Whatever killed those insects could easily kill us. <br>
BARBARA: The Doctor said something like that. I'd forgotten. <br>
IAN: Well, don't touch anything, eh? <br>
BARBARA: But, but Ian. <br>
IAN: I mean, look at the way these seeds are coated. They're obviously
samples. Yes, I think they must be inventing a new insecticide and
they've sprayed these seeds with it. <br>
BARBARA: Surely, I mean, couldn't it be just preserving oil? <br>
IAN: I doubt it. Anyway, you keep away from it. Got a very distinctive
smell, that's one good thing. <br>
BARBARA: I think we should find the others and get back to the ship. <br>
IAN: Yes, I know. I've been wracking my brains. We're so high up here.
Have you got any ideas? <br>
BARBARA: No, I haven't. I wish I had. <br>
IAN: Hey, Barbara, we can get back, you know. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
IAN: All we've got to do is find a piece of string and get down to
ground level. <br>
BARBARA: String would be too thick for us. What we really need is a
reel of cotton. It's all so ridiculous, Ian. <br>
IAN: Barbara, we must concentrate on getting back. Just forget how
absurd things are. Concentrate on getting back. Do you understand? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, all right. <br>
IAN: Hey, that briefcase. Barbara, if we could find enough of those
paperclips, we could string them together and make some sort of a
ladder. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, that's an idea. <br>
IAN: Let's do it, hey? Come on, don't lets give up. <br>
BARBARA: I'm not giving up. <br>
IAN: Good, because the next problem is how to open the flap of the

IAN: It certainly wasn't here before. <br>
SUSAN: Half drawing and half writing. Ian, it's a formula. <br>
IAN: Yes, I believe you're right, Susan. <br>
BARBARA: Do you think it's the formula for the insecticide, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps. <br>
BARBARA: Well, if it is, it'll tell us what we're fighting against. We
might even find a cure. <br>
IAN: A cure? What's the good of that? <br>
BARBARA: I don't know. <br>
IAN: No, neither do I. If we're going to do anything at all, we must
stop it. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, Ian's right, Barbara. You only need a cure if somebody's
infected. What we've got to do is stop it being produced. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Well I think we should take a closer look at this oversized
document. The more we know about the enemy the better. <br>
IAN: Those things up there are definitely molecular structures. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, you're quite right, my boy. I only wish I could see it
more as a whole. <br>
BARBARA: Couldn't we lever it up in some way, stand back and look at
it? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, it'd be like a huge advertising poster, wouldn't it. <br>
IAN: I'm afraid it's far too heavy. We'd never lift it. <br>
DOCTOR: Let me have the notebook, child. Now, we shall have to make a
map of this. Now, Chesterton, you start marking off a section with your
feet, will you? <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: And Susan and Barbara, I want you to call out to me what you
see written beneath you. <br>
(later, the Doctor is studying what he has written) <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. This is the insecticide quite clearly. It's a bit
rough, of course, but it tells us the story. <br>
IAN: Yes. I'm not very well up in this, Doctor, but isn't that
phosphoric acid? <br>
DOCTOR: This indicates the amount of organic esters. <br>
IAN: Yes, and this is mineral nitrate. That's about as far as I go, I'm
afraid. <br>
DOCTOR: My dear boy, this formula's quite clear, look, with one vital
difference. The inventor has made the insecticide everlasting. <br>
SUSAN: That means it would seep into the soil. <br>
IAN: Get into the drinking water. <br>
BARBARA: What about human beings? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, given in sufficient quantity, of course, it's capable of
killing human beings. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, if they drink and eat infected food and water. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, or even coming in contact with it. <br>
IAN: Penetrating the skin to get into the blood stream. <br>
BARBARA: Well then why do we go on just sitting here? <br>
DOCTOR: Now, now, my dear. Gently, gently. <br>
BARBARA: I'm sorry. <br>
SUSAN: Barbara, are you all right? <br>
BARBARA: Yes, I feel a bit giddy. I think I must be hungry. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, now there's another point to consider, my dear boy.
Eating. We can't, even if we do find food here. <br>
IAN: Yes, well, the less we talk about food the more I'll like it. <br>
DOCTOR: We can go back to the sink, of course. The water in the tap is
quite safe. <br>
IAN: Well, no need for all of us to go. I'll go and fetch some. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, but I want to go into that direction. You see, there's
something over there that might be the solution to all this business. <br>
BARBARA: Well, what's that? <br>

IAN: What can we do for her? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's urgent that we get her back to her normal size, but
at the moment her protective cells are too small to cope with the
molecules of poison in her bloodstream. But if we can, that dosage of
insecticide will be seventy time less dangerous. Practically nothing at
all.<br>

BARBARA: Oh, good. Now, what about us. Can you get us back to normal? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. There's your answer, my dear. <br>
(the grain of wheat in the palm of his hand) <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, is that the seed you brought in with you? <br>
DOCTOR: The same seed. <br>
BARBARA: Then we are back to normal! <br>
DOCTOR: Completely, my dear. Now, before I get up and see where we are,
I suggest you all go and have a good scrub, hmm? Off you go. <br>
(Susan, Ian and Barbara leave, and the Doctor switches on the scanner.
But it's just a mass of interference lines) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Now is that irritating. I had
to repair that wretched thing and now look at it, I can't see a thing.
Wait a moment. I think we're beginning to materialise. Perhaps I shall
know now where we are. </font></p>
