</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Tardis materialises amidst the dunes by a golden beach, played by Climping beach, Littlehampton, West Sussex.) <br>
JAMIE: Where are we, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: We're by the seaside, that's where we are. That's all that
matters. <br>
JAMIE: Aye, but where? <br>
VICTORIA: Yes, Doctor, we must know. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, stop fussing, you two. Come on. <br>
(The Doctor runs down the slope to the beach.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, you two. No, wait a minute. See if there's any buckets
and spades in the Tardis. <br>
JAMIE: Buckets and spades? Is he going to dig for worms? <br>
VICTORIA: No, he wants us to play sand castles. <br>
JAMIE: Sand castles? What does he think we are, a couple of children? <br>
(The Doctor runs along the sand, then notices a hovercraft moored further
along the shore and waves at it.)

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The man is Australian.) <br>
ANTON: Hey, Rod, pass me those binoculars. <br>(Rod opens the hatch of the hovercraft.)<br>
ROD: Now what's biting you? <br>
ANTON: Some crazy nut dancing a jig. <br>
(He looks through the binoculars. A third man with curly hair stands up in the hovercraft.) <br>
ANTON: Hey, wait a minute. It can't be. Get below fast, both of you. <br>
ROD: What's the matter? <br>
ANTON: Move!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor is down to his long-johns in the surf.)
<br>
DOCTOR: Come on in, the water's lovely. You don't know what you're
missing. <br>
VICTORIA: Doctor! You'll catch your death. <br>(The Doctor plays in the water, and Jamie laughs.) </font></p>

ANTON [OC]: This is Anton. <br>
ASTRID: Where are you? <br>
ANTON [OC]: Ten miles west of Cape Arid. Now listen. <br>
ASTRID: Wait a minute. <br>(She calls up a map of the area on the wall screen.)<br>ASTRIC: What are you doing there? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASTRID: Well, at least wait till I get there. <br>
(Transmission ends.) <br>
ASTRID: Anton! Anton! <br>
(But Anton is handing out guns.) <br>
ASTRID: Giles, that's just what I said. How could it be him? <br>
KENT [on monitor]: It's a mistake, it must be. <br>
(Played by the BBC's resident Australian, Bill Kerr.) <br>
ASTRID: Yes, I know, but he was definite. He's going to kill him. <br>
KENT [on monitor]: I don't care. Get after them, stop them! <br>
ASTRID: But Giles, what can I do? <br>
KENT [on monitor]: Look, I don't care what you do, Astrid, but stop
them!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor has got dressed again.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, there's nothing like a dip to freshen you up. <br>
JAMIE: Hey, there's a funny looking boat. <br>
DOCTOR: That's not a boat, it's a hovercraft. <br>
JAMIE: Eh? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a hovercraft. It floats on the air instead of the sea. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, yes? Yeah, I'm too old for fairy tales. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's true, Jamie. <br>
VICTORIA: What a terrifying thing. It's like a sea monster. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, we'll soon get a closer look. It's coming nearer. <br>
(The hovercraft is coming straight for them.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes. I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go. <br>
VICTORIA: Why? What's the matter? <br>
DOCTOR: Come on, run. <br>
JAMIE: But Doctor <br>
DOCTOR: Don't argue, run. Come on. <br>JAMIE: What do you mean, run?<br>DOCTOR: Come on! <br>
(Curly and Anton shoot at the travellers as they run for the sand dunes.) <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Dunes]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria
hide in the grassy dunes.) <br>
JAMIE: If only we had a gun. <br>
VICTORIA: But why do they want to harm us? <br>
DOCTOR: Why indeed? Well, what now? <br>
VICTORIA: Look, Doctor, can't we go back to the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: No, we'd never make it. There's not much cover here. <br>
VICTORIA: Perhaps we've landed in a world of mad men. <br>
DOCTOR: They're human beings, if that's what you mean, indulging their
favourite past time. Trying to destroy each other. <br>
(The hovercraft stops at the base of the dunes, and the men disembark with their guns.) <br>
DOCTOR: Time we went. Come on. <br>
(The travellers sneak amongst the dunes. Anton sends Curly off to the
right whilst he and Rod go left. The travellers meet up with Curly.
Jamie knocks him out.) <br>
JAMIE: Creag an tuire! <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, well done. <br>
(Anton and Rod see a helicopter coming in to land.) <br>
JAMIE: What's that? <br>
ROD: I know those markings, that's Astrid's runabout. What's she doing
here? <br>
ANTON: Interfering. We've got to get to him before she does. <br>
(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria run again. The helicopter lands. Astrid is flying
it.) <br>
JAMIE: What is it, Doctor? <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, I'm frightened! <br>
ASTRID: Over here! Run! <br>
VICTORIA: I can't! I can't! <br>
DOCTOR: You must. It's our only chance. <br>
ASTRID: Hurry! <br>
DOCTOR: Come on! <br>
(The three get aboard as Anton and Rod come Funning. Rod stops to check on Curly.) <br>
ANTON: Leave him. <br>
(The helicopter takes off in a hail of bullets.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Helicopter]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: A very timely and welcome rescue. <br>
ASTRID: Don't speak to me for a moment, please. <br>(The
Doctor looks at the permit posted in the back of the helicopter -
Australasion (sic) Zone. Type Helicopter, (private). Valid until 31st
Dec 2018. Class Reg No L23X. Victoria has her arms around Jamie's neck.)<br>
JAMIE: But what is this thing, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: It's a helicopter, Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Huh? <br>
DOCTOR: A chopper. You know, a whirly bird. <br>
JAMIE: He say's it's a bird. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no. It's a primitive form of flying machine. <br>
VICTORIA: Well, at least we're safe now, aren't we? <br>
ASTRID: Depends on what you mean by been safe. They've shot a hole in
the fuel tank. We might blow up any minute. <br>
(Rod gets Curly back to the hovercraft, then they head
back onto the water and follow the helicopter as far as they can.&nbsp;Astrid
flies&nbsp;inland to a lone bungalow.)<br>
ASTRID: Here we go.<br>(She lands the helicopter.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They all get out, Astrid last of all, holding her left arm.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Wait. You're hurt. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Come along inside. <br>
ASTRID: I'm all right. <br>
DOCTOR: Now let's have a look at it. You're not, and please don't
argue. Victoria? Bring some warm water will you? <br>
VICTORIA: Well, where's the kitchen? <br>
ASTRID: Through the arch. There's a medical kit in the bathroom,
through there. <br>
DOCTOR: Go and fetch it, will you, Jamie? <br>
JAMIE: Right. <br>
DOCTOR: Come and sit down. <br>
ASTRID: It's nothing. It's just a scratch. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll see. Oh, yes. <br>ASTRID: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: You mean you don't know? <br>
ASTRID: No, why should I? <br>
DOCTOR: Well you went to such a great deal of trouble to save us. Ah,
there we are. Thank you, Jamie. <br>
ASTRID: Do you know how to use those things? <br>
JAMIE: Oh, don't worry, the Doctor will fix you up just fine. <br>
VICTORIA [OC]: Jamie! <br>
ASTRID: Oh, you're a doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, not of any medical significance. <br>
ASTRID: Doctor of law? Philosophy? <br>
DOCTOR: Which law? Whose philosophies, eh? <br>
ASTRID: Oh, I see. You're determined to be mysterious. <br>
DOCTOR: Am I? <br>
ASTRID: Doctor of science? <br>
DOCTOR: Septic spray. That should be right. <br>
ASTRID: A Doctor of Divinity, then? <br>
DOCTOR: You'll run out of doctors in a minute. Now, you haven't told us
your name yet. <br>
ASTRID: Astrid Ferrier. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, Miss Ferrier, this is Victoria and this is Jamie. <br>
JAMIE: Hello. <br>
DOCTOR: Now, this won't take a minute. I just want to clean it off. Be
as gentle as I can. There we are. Who are these men? Why are they so
determined to kill us? <br>
ASTRID: Kill you. They hate you. <br>
DOCTOR: Me? I'm the nicest possible person. <br>
ASTRID: Or at least I should say they hate the person that they think
you are, passionately and completely. <br>
VICTORIA: Can't we tell them they've made a mistake? <br>
ASTRID: There wouldn't be time. <br>
DOCTOR: They seem remarkably dedicated. <br>
ASTRID: They are. <br>
DOCTOR: There. <br>
(The Doctor finishes dressing her wound.) <br>
DOCTOR: Tell me, Miss Ferrier, do you hate me? <br>
ASTRID: Far from it. To me you're the most wonderful and marvellous man
that's ever dropped out of the skies. Will you do something for me? <br>
DOCTOR: Anything, anything at all. <br>
ASTRID: It'll probably cost you your life. Oh, but it would be worth
it. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, that's, that's comforting, anyway. What is it that you want me to
do? <br>
ASTRID: Let me take you to the man I work for, Giles Kent. He'll
explain everything you want to know. <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so, Miss Ferrier. No, I'm sorry. <br>
JAMIE: Can we not just listen, Doctor? There's no harm in that. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a great deal of harm in it. You don't suppose Miss
Ferrier saved our skins for our sakes, do you? Now what is it you want
us for? <br>
ASTRID: You resemble very closely a man who's determined to be dictator
of the world. A man who will stop at nothing. <br>
VICTORIA: A dictator? Like Napoleon? <br>
DOCTOR: Who is he? <br>
ASTRID: Salamander. <br>
DOCTOR: Salamander? <br>
ASTRID: I know it's surprising. Let me take you to Giles Kent. <br>
(The hovercraft arrives outside.) <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, you're not going to agree? <br>
ASTRID: The back door! Hurry! <br>
DOCTOR: It's too late! <br>
ASTRID: In there! <br>
(They hide in another room as Rod comes in through the back door. As he comes through
the arch to the living room, Astrid grabs him jumps out from behind the settee and throws him against
the wall.) <br>
ASTRID: Run for it! <br>
JAMIE: Come on! <br>
(Shots are fired through the window, killing Rod.) <br>
JAMIE: Miss Ferrier, come on. <br>
(Anton and Curly come in through the front.) <br>
CURLY: But I. He was framed against the window. I saw him, he was
trying to get out! <br>
ANTON: No time now. They'll get away! <br>
CURLY: There they are! <br>
(Curly fires through the window.) <br>
ANTON: Wait! If we can get up in the air above them we can finish this.
Now let's get to that helicopter!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor, Astrid, Victoria and Jamie hide in a
ditch, and watch Anton and Curly run to the helipad.) <br>
ASTRID: The helicopter.<br>
(It takes off, leaking fuel.) <br>
ASTRID: It'll blow up!
<br>(And so it does.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Kent's office]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KENT: Incredible.<br>(He walks around the Doctor.)<br>KENT: Absolutely incredible. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not a specimen in a glass bowl, you know. <br>
KENT: I'm sorry. Do sit down. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. <br>
KENT: It's just so astonishing. You are Salamander? <br>
ASTRID: You see what I mean? <br>
KENT: But surely you know how alike you are? After all, Salamander is a
world figure. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, my friends and I, we've been out of touch of civilisation
for a little while. We're visitors, so to speak. On ice, shall we say. <br>
KENT: I see. Where shall I start? <br>
DOCTOR: At the beginning, please. We've been subjected to a number of
attacks because I look like this Salamander of yours. <br>
KENT: I'm not surprised. I'll show you why. I have a video wire of
Salamander addressing the United Zones Conference on World Food. <br>(Starting with stock footage of the United Nations building.)<br>
REPORTER [OC]: And meanwhile, over at the United Zones General
Assembly, from all over the world delegates were flocking in, eager to
hear the latest report from Leader Salamander. <br>
(A swarthy black-haired man stands at a dais, the spitting image of the
Doctor apart from the side parting and suntan. He speaks with a Mexican
accent.) <br>
SALAMANDER [on screen]: The progress, Mister President, of the Sun
Conservation establishment at Kanowa, in the Australasian Zone, is, I'm
delighted to report, highly satisfactory. But we cannot yet guarantee
good summer holidays for all. (laughter) However, we have now in orbit the Mark
Seven Sun Catcher, and already we have been able to concentrate the
sun's rays into much needed areas. The great Canadian wheat plains are
safe. And now, Mister President, Ukraine, the grain field of the
planet, that unfortunate area between Bucava and Kirovograd devastated
by the elements two short years ago. What have I to say to you about
that? I can tell you that on both banks of the Dnieper River the corn
is ripening in the sun! And ten-thousand robot harvesters are moving
down to gather in fifty million tons of flour! <br>
VICTORIA: There's nothing there to say he's a bad man. <br>
DOCTOR: I quite agree, Victoria. He seems to be a public benefactor.
Quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome, didn't you think so Jamie?
<br>
KENT: He's one of the most popular men on the planet. Many people call
him the shopkeeper of the world. The saviour, in fact, some of them. <br>
JAMIE: Well, what's he saved the world from? <br>
ASTRID: Starvation. Too many people, too little food. <br>
KENT: Until Salamander invented his Sun Store. But surely you've heard?
You must know? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, well of course, we've heard something. <br>
KENT: The Sun Store collects the rays from the sun and stores them in
concentrated form. <br>
JAMIE: Oh, like the ioniser, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, a rather different principle, I think, Jamie, but <br>
VICTORIA: Well, never mind how it works. What's it for? <br>
KENT: Salamander can force-grow three, sometimes four, crops in one
summer. <br>
JAMIE: Well, why do these men want to kill him? I mean, one minute you
say he's saving the world, the next <br>
KENT: For his own ends. Step by step, he's taking control of this
planet. <br>
DOCTOR: You have proof of this? <br>
KENT: Some, yes. I was once a high official in the World Zone
Authority. Deputy Security Leader for North Africa and Europe, but
Salamander discredited and ruined me because he realised I was
beginning to get suspicious. <br>
DOCTOR: But you could be making up stories about Salamander out of
revenge. <br>
KENT: Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself. <br>(Kent puts another video wire into his machine.)<br>KENT: You remember
Michael Assevski? He was Controller of the Eastern European Zone. He
was drowned at sea a mile from shore. <br>
(A series of pictures come up on the screen.) <br>
KENT: Hockingham, murdered. All of them were seen with Salamander, or a
man known as his deputy, shortly before their deaths. <br>
ASTRID: All of them were replaced by men known to be in Salamander's
power. <br>
DOCTOR: Known by who? <br>
KENT: By me, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, why don't you tell the authorities, the police or
whatever? <br>
KENT: Because I'm discredited, don't you see? Because Salamander is so
popular and also because the man that took my place, a man named Donald
Bruce, has since risen to become overall Security Chief. <br>
DOCTOR: Surely there is someone you can take your story to? <br>
KENT: Oh, yes. Elvick believed me. So did Assevski. And they're dead.
However there is one other man, a man named Alexander Denes, (pronounced Denesh) but none
of them will do anything until it's too late. <br>
VICTORIA: I'm surprised. Well, if Salamander is everything you say he
is, then why hasn't he tried to <br>
KENT: Dispose of me? <br>
VICTORIA: Yes. <br>
KENT: Well, he has, but he's afraid. You see, the testimony of a dead
man still holds legal weight. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands
whether to believe Mister Kent or not. <br>
KENT: Well, there is one way that you can find out for yourselves. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, how? <br>
ASTRID: Impersonate Salamander. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought that's what we were leading up to. <br>
JAMIE: Well, I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him. <br>
VICTORIA: Exactly like him. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice? <br>
ASTRID: Well, it's nearly the same pitch. Only the accent <br>
DOCTOR: Only the accent? My dear young lady. Oh, dear. Now, what was it
he said. (tries an imitation) We still cannot guarantee good summer
holidays for all. No. Guarantee. No, no. Guaran. Guarantee. You see,
it's very difficult. Of course, I always was interested in phonetics.
Holidays. Summer. Summer. He must have come from Mexico. Quintana Roo
or Yucatan I shouldn't wonder. <br>
KENT: That's incredible, Doctor. He was born at Merida, state capital
of Yucatan. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, there are other very strong influences though. Oh, I could
do it in time. But what if I did? What then? <br>
KENT: You could walk into Salamander's Research Station at Kanowa, find
out how he's getting control of the separate World Zones and then bring
out absolute proof. <br>
(The phone buzzes. Kent listens.) <br>
KENT: Yes. I see. How long did you say it would take you to master
Salamander's accent? <br>
DOCTOR: I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four. <br>
KENT: Well, while we've been talking the Security Chief I told you
about, Donald Bruce, has since cordoned off this entire area. He's
coming here himself, now! I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor.
<br>
DOCTOR: But that's out of the question! <br>
KENT: You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you, a man who
resembles Salamander so closely? <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, that's not fair! <br>
KENT: Will you please listen! You'll be under arrest for impersonation
as soon as he sees you. I mean it. <br>
DOCTOR: But isn't there another way out of this? <br>
KENT: Only one. Be Salamander. <br>
VICTORIA: But the clothes! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
KENT: Yes, there are some in here. <br>
(Kent opens an inner office door.) <br>
KENT: A little less eccentric, but do the best you can. <br>
DOCTOR: I won't! I can't! <br>
KENT: Your friends, Doctor, do you want them to suffer? Because they
will, you know. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, wait a minute! Why is a man like Bruce coming here? Don't push me.<br>
KENT:&nbsp;There isn't time. <br>
DOCTOR: You sent for him, didn't you? You tipped him off! <br>
KENT: I couldn't miss an opportunity like this. Now please, come on. <br>
(Kent pushes the Doctor into the inner office.) <br>
ASTRID: Giles, for heaven's sake, what have you done? It's far too
risky. <br>
(A security guard with a gun opens the door and stands outside. A tall, heavy man walks past him.)
<br>
BRUCE: Hello, Kent. Doing some recruiting, are you? A bit young for
killers, aren't they? <br>
VICTORIA: What do you mean? <br>
KENT: All right, what do you mean by stepping in here like this? <br>
BRUCE: Any time, Kent. I've got the right and you know it. Any time I
like. <br>
KENT: All right, what do you want? <br>
BRUCE: That's better. You're ex-security, you know the way it's got to
go. We might as well be nice and civil about it, mightn't we? That
bungalow in Cedar District. In your name, right? <br>
ASTRID: Why? <br>
BRUCE: Do I have to tell you? There's been an awful nasty mess out
there. Someone has got himself shot in your living room. And who are
you two? <br>
JAMIE: Jamie McCrimmon. <br>
BRUCE: And? <br>
JAMIE: Victoria Waterfield. <br>
BRUCE: What's the matter, can't you speak? <br>
VICTORIA: Don't shout at me. <br>
BRUCE: Oh, very good. The outraged public citizen. Do they know who I
am? <br>
KENT: Yes, they do. <br>
BRUCE: A pity. I like to hear you say it. Now listen to this, all of
you. One of your men was murdered in a bungalow rented to you. The
remains of two others were found in what was left of a helicopter. You

with you. Two youngsters and a man, right? Now, there was another man,
wasn't there? So we'll deal with that first. Where is he? <br>

you behave like this? I'm at least entitled to know your movements. <br>
DOCTOR: You have a policeman's mind, Bruce. <br>
BRUCE: That may be, but only a few days ago you questioned me about
this man and his activities, and we agreed that he was dangerous. Now I
find you in his office. <br>
DOCTOR: Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way. <br>

DOCTOR: Holding me? <br>
BRUCE: Under some threat or other? <br>
DOCTOR: No one threatens Salamander. <br>

DOCTOR: Yes, of course. You shall have it. But not now. When I return
from the Central European Zone. <br>
BRUCE: Very well. Now, what about the dead man found in your bungalow.
He was one of your lot, wasn't he?
<br>ASTRID: Yes. Er, he was trying to protect me. The other two wanted to kill
me. <br>
BRUCE: Now why should they want to do that to a nice young girl like
you? <br>
ASTRID: Well I <br>
KENT: Obviously they thought I was there. <br>

BRUCE: Well, I'm not. <br>
DOCTOR: That's interesting, but not important. I accept it, that's all
that matters. <br>

now. Is that right? <br>
DOCTOR: You still dare to question me? They have information. I shall
get it. I will see you on my return. Now leave me. <br>

ASTRID: That was a dangerous game to play. <br>
KENT: It paid off. All right, are you with us? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't know where you stand, Mister Kent, but you and this
Salamander are obviously on opposite sides. That at least is clear. But
which side is good? Which side is bad? And why should I interfere? <br>
ASTRID: Well, you're the only man who can help save the world. <br>
VICTORIA: But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do? <br>

couldn't turn our back on a chance like this, Doctor. Well, at least I
know you wouldn't. <br>

find out for yourselves. <br>

JAMIE: He'll be well guarded for a start. <br>
VICTORIA: We can hardly steal into his study and go through his papers.

DOCTOR: That man Bruce said that he was in the Central European Zone.
<br>
VICTORIA: It's a long way from Australia. <br>
ASTRID: It's only two hours by rocket. <br>
KENT: You could leave almost at once. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, what then? <br>
ASTRID: I've had a plan for infiltrating into Salamander's inner circle
for some time. Well, I could adapt it for your two friends. <br>
KENT: I can arrange three travel warrants and visas. Everything you
need. <br>
JAMIE: Just three? <br>
KENT: Well one for Astrid, one for you and <br>
VICTORIA: Victoria. <br>
KENT: Of course. <br>

you said you had no official position.<br>

DOCTOR: He must be a very important person. <br>
ASTRID: He is. Denes, Controller of the Zone. <br>

BRUCE: I've just driven straight here from having spoken to Salamander,
not two hundred miles away. <br>
BENIK: That's impossible. <br>
BRUCE: I don't lie, even to someone like you. He was with Giles Kent. <br>
BENIK: But he hates Kent. <br>
BRUCE: Exactly. <br>
BENIK: Kent wasn't holding him by force, was he? <br>
BRUCE: No, I thought of that. Salamander was a wee bit odd, I admit.
Not quite his usual self, but he was perfectly in control. All he had
to do was bat an eyelid and I'd have knocked off everyone in sight. <br>
BENIK: Oh well, I don't understand it. <br>
BRUCE: Now, Salamander suggested that he was on his way to the Central
European Zone. Now you're in radio contact with him. I want you to talk
to him, make sure that Kent hasn't got some hold over him that we don't
know about. <br>
BENIK: He instructed me not to bother him until the conference was
over. <br>
BRUCE: Well, I'm countermanding that instruction. <br>
BENIK: I'm telling you, Bruce, he won't answer. Not till the conference
is over. It's too important. <br>
BRUCE: How long will it last? <br>
BENIK: How should I know? They last three hours, usually. <br>

you've spoken to him. Is that clear? Is that clear? <br>
BENIK: Yes. <br>

BENIK: I want a direct channel link to Leader Salamander, Ariel TLXKZ.
Notify me as soon as he is able to accept transmission. That's all.

this man that this Zone was in danger of natural disaster and he did
nothing! Issued no cautions to the public. You deliberately allowed
your people to suffer and die. You're a traitor! <br>

KENT: I'm certain Salamander's causing the earthquakes, Doctor, and I'm
sure your friends Jamie and Victoria will tell you just how bad he
really is. <br>
DOCTOR: But why make earthquakes? <br>
KENT: Years ago, Doctor, when one country wanted to invade another it
set about attacking the confidence of that country, throwing it into
confusion, making it weak. Then it was right for takeover. Now, isn't
that exactly what's happening here, only in a different way? <br>
DOCTOR: What you're saying is that Salamander's found a way of
harnessing the natural forces of the earth. It's a little difficult to
accept. I'm not saying it's impossible, mind you. You say it's coming
from the Research Station. Salamander's Research Station, eh? <br>
(The Doctor looks at it through a pair of binoculars.) <br>
KENT: That's what I believe, in spite of. Shush! Wait a minute. <br>
(Kent looks outside.) <br>
KENT: In spite of a number of reasons. He invented the sunstore, a
brilliant advance. He found a way of directing conserved energy to
areas starved of sun. <br>
DOCTOR: What made you suspicious? <br>
KENT: All the money he was spending at the Research Station. The
materials involved, the food stores. It didn't make sense. I had all
the papers, all the requisition orders. <br>
DOCTOR: But that's valuable evidence! <br>
KENT: All destroyed, and new ones appeared, and I was made out to be
the criminal. All by suggestion, of course. I was discredited. And
every accusation I made against Salamander was put down as an attempt
to throw suspicion off myself. <br>
DOCTOR: A sort of Jekyll and Hyde character, perhaps, our Mister
Salamander. It'll be interesting to see what report Jamie brings back. <br>

KENT: Why won't you believe me? <br>
DOCTOR: It is too important. I must be sure. Oh dear. What pretty
crockery this is. Sad really, isn't it? People spend all their time
making nice things, and other people come along and break them. <br>

COLIN: We can return to the surface? <br>
SALAMANDER: No, no, no, not yet, but I've found another store of food. <br>
COLIN: Thank goodness! <br>
SALAMANDER: And it is undamaged. Colin, open the last store of wine, huh?
Go on, you help him too, Mary. <br>
(Colin and Mary leave.) <br>
SWANN: You must take it slowly, for goodness sake. <br>
SALAMANDER: I'm all right my friend, I'm just a little dizzy. It's

am back with you again and I have brought food for you. Plenty of food.
<br>
SWANN: Here's to the man who contrived<br>
SALAMANDER: Please, Swann. I remembered on my way back down here that
we are near our anniversary again. In a few short weeks, we survivors
will have been down in this shelter for exactly five years. <br>
CROWD: Five years. <br>
SALAMANDER: Colin and Mary were just teenagers then. Look at them now.
We fed ourselves. But what's more than that, we are fighting back! We
are doing something! <br>
CROWD: Yes! Yes! <br>
COLIN: Will we return to the surface, Salamander? <br>
SALAMANDER: Yes, of course we will. This is what I'm striving for. But
up there, it's terrible still. The war goes on and on, and you never know
when the air is clean or when it's poison. <br>
COLIN: When can we return? <br>
SALAMANDER: We have to fight for a while longer, hmm? Creating natural
disasters, monsoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, always in the
places where the enemies of truth and freedom gather together. <br>
COLIN: You tell us this all the time, Salamander. When are we going to
escape from this nightmare prison, that's all I'm asking you? <br>
MARY: Colin, please. <br>
COLIN: I want an answer! <br>
SALAMANDER: You shall have an answer, my friend. You will return to the
surface when you have a good chance of survival. <br>
(Salamander staggers.) <br>COLIN: You are ill.<br>
SALAMANDER: No, no, it's all right. But you must believe me. Colin, all
of you. You cannot return to the surface until is safe to do so. Please
my friend, we must, we must<br>
(Swann and Salamander return to the control room.) <br>
MARY: You shouldn't have asked him, Colin. He's doing his best. <br>
COLIN: I can't help it, Mary. Next time, I'm going to make him take me

SALAMANDER: No, Swann. We must check the power levels, huh? <br>(Salamander closes the door. Swann returns.)<br>

(Kent and Astrid move away from the Doctor.) <br>

he fixed this underneath your trailer. <br>
ASTRID: A radio tracking device. <br>
KENT: On whose authority? <br>
BRUCE: Mine. <br>
(Bruce looks at the Doctor.) <br>
BRUCE: It's amazing how alike you and Salamander are. Incredible. You
fooled me the first time we met, but now, even Salamander himself would
think he was looking in a mirror. Why? You want this man to impersonate
Salamander, why? How much are they paying you? <br>
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? <br>
BRUCE: They want you to assassinate Salamander, don't they? Take his
place? <br>
DOCTOR: But that's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that. <br>
BRUCE: But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, well, yes. <br>
BRUCE: All right then, why? <br>
DOCTOR: Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner. I was
going to attempt to rescue them. <br>
ASTRID: And at the same time get evidence that would expose Salamander
as a traitor, blackmailer and murderer. <br>
BRUCE: Quite an ambitious plan. How do you know such evidence exists? <br>
KENT: It exists in Salamander's records. <br>
BRUCE: Oh, yes, I know why you want Salamander out of the way. You hate
him because he exposed your profitable sideline of misusing public
money. <br>
ASTRID: Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money. <br>
KENT: And I was dismissed from my post and the evidence against
Salamander concealed. <br>
BRUCE: So you say. But you've no evidence at all against Salamander,
have you? <br>
KENT: I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records. <br>
BRUCE: And I'm expected to take that from you? <br>
DOCTOR: We do hold evidence that Salamander isn't quite so pure and
white as he's painted. <br>
BRUCE: No? What? <br>
DOCTOR: A file, containing certain information about a gentleman called
Fedorin. <br>
ASTRID: Salamander was going to use this evidence against Fedorin.
Blackmail him into submission. After he'd got rid of Denes, that is. <br>
KENT: And so gain control of another zone. <br>
BRUCE: Where is this file? <br>
DOCTOR: Fariah has it. Salamander's food taster. <br>(Oops. The Doctor covers his mouth.)<br>
BRUCE: Fariah? But she's dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Dead? But how? <br>
BRUCE: She was shot by one of Benik's guards escaping arrest. <br>DOCTOR: Oh, that's terrible.<br>
KENT: Escaping arrest? Benik had her killed because she had evidence
against Salamander. <br>
ASTRID: And Benik will return the file to Salamander. We must get to
the Research Station. <br>
BRUCE: You're not going anywhere or doing anything. As far as I'm
concerned, this story you've told me could be a pack of lies to cover
your attempt to assassinate Salamander. Now I'm not saying I'm
altogether satisfied with Salamander or his organisation, but I'll
investigate in my own way. <br>
KENT: Meanwhile Salamander will have found a way to cover himself, and
also a way of disposing of you. You're digging your own grave, Bruce. <br>
BRUCE: That's my affair. And I do things my own way. <br>
(Astrid grabs the guard's gun.) <br>
ASTRID: And I do things my way. Really, as Head of Security, you should
have more reliable guards.

BRUCE: By getting into Salamander's Research Station. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. And my two young friends may have some information. <br>
BRUCE: And if there isn't any evidence? <br>
DOCTOR: Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us and put us in
prison, won't you? <br>
BRUCE: All right, I'll do it on one condition. <br>
DOCTOR: And what's that? <br>
BRUCE: That you and I go alone. Kent and the girl stay here as
hostages. <br>
KENT: Now wait a minute. I must go with him. <br>

KENT: Now, wait a minute. They'll be after both of us now. <br>
SALAMANDER: Oh no, they won't. <br>
KENT: I tell you, they know. <br>
SALAMANDER: So what do you want me to do, huh? Bury our differences? I
didn't need you once. I still don't need you. <br>
KENT: Now wait a minute. The place is mined, we know that. We planned
it for years, together. Between us we can destroy them all, and the
evidence. Just you and me, Salamander. <br>
SALAMANDER: You and me. What use are you to me? You were useful once,
but now. <br>
KENT: No, no! <br>
(Salamander shoots Kent in the shoulder. Kent runs back down the
tunnel as Salamander laughs maniacally.) <br>
SALAMANDER: You won't get away from me, Kent. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Underground room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor and Astrid watch on the monitor as Kent
is trapped.) <br>
SALAMANDER: I told you you could not escape me. <br>
(Salamander shoots Kent in the stomach.) <br>
KENT: Well, if I'm going to die, Salamander, you'll die with me. <br>
(Kent pulls a control lever.) <br>
SALAMANDER: No! No! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Records room]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The explosion rocks the Research Station. The
records room door bursts open, and the guard and Bruce rush in.) <br>
BRUCE: Are you hurt? Let's get out of here. Come on, Doctor,&nbsp;we're going to get you out of here. <br>
(On the monitor a hand can be seen sticking out of the rubble.) <br>
ASTRID: Oh, look. Salamander! Giles! They're dead! <br>
BRUCE: We'll be dead too if we don't get out of here. <br>DOCTOR: Let's get out of here. <br>BRUCE: Come along.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the records room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASTRID: The people. <br>
BRUCE: People. What people? <br>
ASTRID: The people underground in the deep shelter. <br>
DOCTOR: They may have been killed. <br>
ASTRID: I promised Swann I'd get them out. <br>
BRUCE: But that's not your fault. You couldn't have done more. <br>
DOCTOR: There's a TV monitor screen in there. There must be a link to
the deep shelter.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Records room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Astrid turns the monitor on.)<br>ASTRID: It's all right! They're alive! <br>
BRUCE: How are you going to get to them? <br>
ASTRID: There's a tunnel from outside. We can get to it outside the Research Station. <br>
BRUCE: But that's probably been destroyed by the explosion. <br>
ASTRID: We'll get to them somehow. <br>
BRUCE: Look out! <br>
(Some of the ceiling falls down.) <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Outside the records room]</b><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASTRID: Give me some men. I'll lead them. <br>
BRUCE: All right. I'll go with you. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh good, that's splendid. I'll come too. <br>
ASTRID: Oh no, Doctor. It's far too dangerous. They might mistake you
as Salamander. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Oh. <br>
ASTRID: Are you hurt? <br>
DOCTOR: No, I'm all right. I'll come with you as far as the gates. Come
on, we must go.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Beach]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Night.&nbsp;Jamie steps out of the
Tardis. A little man staggers towards him.) <br>
JAMIE: I thought you were never coming. Hey, Doctor, are you all right?
<br>
(Jamie helps him into the Tardis.)
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VICTORIA: Oh, there you are, Doctor. You do look in
a state. Come and sit down. <br>
JAMIE: I told you he wouldn't be long. You, you worry too much. <br>
VICTORIA: We shouldn't have left him. <br>
JAMIE: You see, after the explosion, Doctor, we didnae know what to do.
You said to come back here, which we did, but I'm sure we were
followed. <br>
VICTORIA: Please, can we start straight away? <br>
(The little man is staring at the console, confused. He gestures at Jamie.)
<br>
JAMIE: Me, Doctor? But you said we were never to touch the controls. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite right, Jamie. <br>
(The real Doctor is in the doorway.) <br>
DOCTOR: Welcome to the Tardis. <br>
SALAMANDER: Thank you. You're doing so well impersonating me, I thought
I might return the compliment. <br>
DOCTOR: And Giles Kent? <br>
SALAMANDER: Unfortunately, he didn't survive the explosion. <br>
DOCTOR: We're going to put you outside, Salamander. No friends, no
safety, nothing. You'll run, but they'll catch up with you. <br>(Salamander lunges for the console.)<br>DOCTOR: No! <br>
(Salamander pins the Doctor against the console.) <br>
SALAMANDER: And now I'm going to kill you. <br>
JAMIE: No, you don't. <br>
(Jamie pulls Salamander off the Doctor, who is thrown to the floor. The Tardis
dematerialises while the doors are still open.) <br>
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Victoria! Jamie! Hold onto something! <br>
(The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria lie on the floor holding hands and hang
on to a chair leg which amazingly doesn't move.) <br>
DOCTOR: Jamie! Oh!<br>
(Salamander can't get a hold of anything, and is sucked out into the Vortex.) </font> </p>
