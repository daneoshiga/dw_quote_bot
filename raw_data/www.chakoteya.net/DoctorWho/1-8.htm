<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: There we are. Home. <br>
BARBARA: Doctor, we <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right. Chesterton made the position quite clear. Now,
I have some work to do. <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, please. <br>
DOCTOR: Hush, child. Say your goodbyes and remember, we shall be
leaving almost immediately. <br>
IAN: Do you have to be in such a hurry? <br>
DOCTOR: Enough time has been wasted bringing you back, young man. I
have the universe to explore. <br>
SUSAN: Must you go? <br>
BARBARA: Susan, we've visited many places together, had lots of
adventures, but you always knew we intended to return home when we
could. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, I know, but <br>
BARBARA: Look, I know it's hard to say goodbye, but one day you'll
understand why we had to. <br>
SUSAN: But Grandfather can bring you back any time now. <br>
IAN: Don't you see, Susan, the longer we leave it the harder it'll be. <br>
(Susan hugs them then leaves) <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Still here? <br>
IAN: Yes, we're waiting for you to carry out the checks. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite unnecessary. <br>
IAN: Oh is it? Are you so certain you know where we are? <br>
DOCTOR: Certain? Of course I'm certain. If you doubt me, take a look
for yourselves. <br>
(switches on the scanner.) <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps that will satisfy you. <br>
BARBARA: Mmm. It could be, I suppose. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you. Obviously you're still in doubt. Let us take a
longer look, through the trees, hmm? <br>
BARBARA: Ian, look. Fields, crops, it's fully cultivated! <br>
IAN: Yes. Pity it's so dark. I can't see a sign of any buildings. <br>
BARBARA: You know, it reminds me of a holiday I once took in Somerset. <br>
DOCTOR: Then I expect it is Somerset, my dear. Well, if you're going,
be off with you. <br>
IAN: Look Doctor, I think it'd be better if you came with us. At least
to explore. <br>
DOCTOR: It's out of the question. I refuse to leave the ship. <br>
IAN: Maybe you have succeeded. Maybe we are where you say we are. But I
remember an occasion when you took us home once before. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, and we met Marco Polo. <br>
DOCTOR: Entirely different circumstances! I'm rather tired of your
insinuations that I am not master of this craft. Oh, I admit, it did
develop a fault, a minor fault on one occasion, perhaps twice, but
nothing I couldn't control. <br>
IAN: I know that. Of course you're in control. You're always in
control. And I'm sure you could revisit us at any time. <br>
DOCTOR: Very simple. Quite simple. <br>
IAN: Exactly, quite simple. But you have your important researches to
complete. You may not find the time. There's a chance that we won't
meet again. Don't you think it would be better if we parted under more
friendly circumstances, say over a drink? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, well perhaps, since you put it that way, an hour or
two won't come amiss. Susan, bring my stick will you? <br>
SUSAN: Yes, Grandfather? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm going to see Ian and Barbara back home safely. <br>
(Susan and the Doctor leave) <br>
BARBARA: Well done, Ian. I say, do you think we really are home? <br>
IAN: I don't know. Won't take us long to find out, will it? Come on.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor locks the Tardis as the others look
around) <br>
DOCTOR: Well? <br>
BARBARA: Well those crops suggest a manor or farmhouse. It should be
reasonably close. <br>
SUSAN: It's very warm, isn't it? It must be summertime. Ian? <br>
IAN: Yes? <br>
SUSAN: Why aren't there any lights? <br>
IAN: That's a point. It's dusk, and we've got a very good view from
here. <br>
BARBARA: Well, towns and villages can be well-spaced, even in England. <br>
DOCTOR: Are we going to stand here talking all night, hmm? Hmm? <br>
(there's a movement in the bushes) <br>
IAN: All right, Susan, I saw it. Keep talking. <br>
SUSAN: All right. Be careful though. <br>
(Ian circles through the trees) <br>
BARBARA: Did you see what it was? <br>
SUSAN: No, I didn't. <br>
DOCTOR: Perhaps it was a rabbit. Do you know, Chesterton's getting
quite jumpy these days. Young man like him shouldn't suffer from
nerves. <br>
(Ian reappears with a boy) <br>
BARBARA: Well, that rabbit of yours is putting up quite a fight. Ian,
you're hurting him! <br>
IAN: Oh, no, I'm not! <br>
DOCTOR: Come here, my boy. Where are we? Where do you live, hmm? <br>
SUSAN: Grandfather, you're frightening him. We're your friends. Don't
be afraid. <br>
BARBARA: Look at him. He's absolutely terrified. <br>
IAN: Yes. Of us, or of something else? <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, answer my questions, boy. <br>
JEAN PIERRE: Please, I've done nothing. <br>
IAN: We're not going to hurt you. <br>
BARBARA: No of course, we're not. Look, we've lost our way and we need
you help. This is England, isn't it? <br>
JEAN PIERRE: England? No, France. <br>
IAN: France? Well, how far from Paris? <br>
JEAN PIERRE: Not far. Twelve kilometres. <br>
IAN: Oh, that's something, I suppose. <br>
DOCTOR: Paris, eh? A hundred miles or so either way is to be expected.
After all, it's only a fraction of the distance we've covered. It's
quite accurate, in fact. <br>
IAN: Yes. Assuming the distance is our only error. You know, Doctor, I
have a feeling you've been building up our hopes again. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, nonsense. Let's have a word with the boy. Now look here, my
boy. Hold still <br>
(Jean Pierre makes a break for it.) <br>
IAN: We lost him. <br>
DOCTOR: You don't say. <br>
IAN: Pity. Probably knows these woods like the back of his hand. <br>
SUSAN: I wonder why he was so afraid.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Chesterton, there's a house. Look, straight
ahead of us. <br>
IAN: Yes. What do you make of it, Barbara? <br>
BARBARA: Well, it looks deserted. You know, I'm certain we're sometime
in the past. <br>
IAN: Yes. Well, we were a hundred miles out. Perhaps we're a hundred
years out. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, rubbish, rubbish. <br>
BARBARA: Well, it's possible. <br>
IAN: You know, I think we ought to get back to the ship while we still
can. <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense. It was your idea to explore, anyway. Besides, that
might be very interesting. The walk will do us good. <br>
SUSAN: Come on, you two. You don't want to be lost in the dark. <br>
IAN: Don't worry, we're right behind you. <br>
BARBARA: Well, we're still not home. <br>
IAN: No, we're not, are we? Still, I do think he tried this time, even
if it was out of bad temper. <br>
BARBARA: So we stay with the ship. <br>
IAN: Yes. Cheered Susan up, hasn't it? <br>
BARBARA: Well, are you disappointed? <br>
IAN: Funny enough, no. I don't know. Depends where we are. I still
could be. <br>
SUSAN: Ian! Barbara! <br>
BARBARA: Well, we'd better join the others.

DOCTOR: It looks uninhabited. I wonder if we can get in? <br>
(Ian and Barbara enter.) <br>
BARBARA: Did you find anything? <br>
SUSAN: Not yet. Grandfather's seeing if he can get in. <br>
IAN: Oh, is he now? <br>
(The Doctor is looking through a dirty window) <br>
IAN: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I say, take a look through there, will you? I think your eyes
are sharper than mine. <br>
IAN: Too dark to see anything, Doctor. No, I don't think anyone's lived
here for years. Doctor? Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: We're in luck. The door's unlocked. </font></p>

Doctor lights the candles) <br>
DOCTOR: I'll take upstairs and you search down. <br>
IAN: All right. <br>
(The Doctor goes through the door to the stairs.) <br>
BARBARA: Where's the Doctor? <br>
IAN: He's gone upstairs. Look at this. What do you think a candlestick
like that's doing in a place like this? <br>
BARBARA: I don't know. <br>
IAN: Here's a tinderbox. <br>
SUSAN: Look at this! <br>
(it's a chest full of clothes) <br>
BARBARA: Hey, this is eighteenth century. <br>
SUSAN: Look at this one! <br>
BARBARA: You know, there's a whole wardrobe here. Look, they're all
different sizes too. <br>
IAN: Look at these bundles. Bottles of wine. Bread. A bit stale. <br>
BARBARA: There's another bundle over here. Hey, look at all these maps.
There's a whole bunch of daggers down here. <br>
IAN: These documents. Official documents. Undated and the name is left
blank. They're passes, Barbara. <br>
BARBARA: Yes, but nobody lives here. I mean, look at the dust
everywhere. <br>
IAN: This is a stopping-off place. A link in some escape chain. Here,
look at this. <br>
BARBARA: Ian, this is signed by Robespierre! <br>
IAN: Robespierre? Must be a. Oh, wait a minute. The Doctor's put us
down right in the middle of the French Revolution. <br>
BARBARA: Yes. The Reign of Terror.
(Upstairs, the Doctor has been hit from behind and knocked out) <br>
(Downstairs, the group are getting dressed with clothes the chest) <br>
IAN: Doctor? Doctor? <br>
BARBARA: How do I look? <br>
IAN: Very pretty, mademoiselle. Hairstyle's a bit modern, but it's all
right. It was a good idea to change into these clothes. We won't look
so conspicuous when we go back to the ship. <br>
SUSAN: We might not get back to the ship if Grandfather hears we're in
the Reign of Terror. <br>
IAN: Why not? <br>
SUSAN: It's his favourite period in the history of Earth. <br>
IAN: Not getting very far, are we? What on Earth's he doing up there?
Come on. Let's go and find him. <br>
(there are two men in the doorway, with pistols.) <br>
ROUVRAY: Don't move. Please put that on the table. <br>
(the candlestick is put down.) <br>
ROUVRAY: Thank you. What are you doing here? <br>
D'ARGENSON: Don't waste time, Rouvray. Kill them. They're after us. <br>
ROUVRAY: I think not, but I would advise you to answer the question. <br>
BARBARA: We're travellers. <br>
SUSAN: We only stopped here til we could find our way. <br>
ROUVRAY: At a deserted house? <br>
D'ARGENSON: You'll gain nothing by this questioning. We should be
moving on! <br>
ROUVRAY: Patience, d'Argenson, even in these troubled times our
visitors have the right of an explanation, even if our enemies do not
accord such
privileges. <br>
IAN: We're not your enemies. We are what we say we are, travellers. <br>
ROUVRAY: When you entered our hideout, you entered our lives. Do you
travel alone? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
D'ARGENSON: You see, they lie! <br>
ROUVRAY: We found the old man upstairs. Do not count on his assistance.
<br>
SUSAN: What have you done with him? <br>
ROUVRAY: At the moment he's safe. It was in your power to see that he
came to no harm. But your answer proves that you do not speak
truthfully. There is something you are concealing. <br>
IAN: It doesn't concern you. <br>
D'ARGENSON: We must be leaving now. The soldiers will have followed! <br>
ROUVRAY: In France now there are only two sides. You're either with us
or against us. Our sympathies are obvious. We want to know yours. <br>
BARBARA: We appreciate what you say, but we have no side. We're not
even French. <br>
ROUVRAY: A word of warning. If you intend to stay in France you will
have to choose. <br>
D'ARGENSON: We cannot trust them now! <br>
ROUVRAY: If we are to escape from France, we must have faith. If all
people are incapable of our trust, we shall take the Terror with us. <br>
SUSAN: Where is my Grandfather? <br>
ROUVRAY: The old man? D'Argenson, go. <br>
IAN: Shh! Listen. <br>
(armed men emerge from the forest) <br>
D'ARGENSON: The soldiers! They've found us! <br>
ROUVRAY: Quiet. <br>
D'ARGENSON: But they'll take us to Paris, to the guillotine. Rouvray, I
can't, I can't let that happen. My whole family were executed, even my
younger sister. They came to the house while I was out and they dragged
them away. Rouvray, we must go while we have the chance! <br>
ROUVRAY: They will see us. Our only hope is to stay here and hide. They
may pass. <br>
IAN: They're coming in. <br>
D'ARGENSON: It will be the guillotine for all of us! <br>
ROUVRAY: D'Argenson. D'Argenson, quiet! <br>

still be running. They won't have stopped yet. <br>

They could be hiding in this house. <br>

LIEUTENANT: No. No, let's let them rest. They've had a long march.
We'll cover the back. <br>

soldiers. <br>
ROUVRAY: You. Come here. Give it to me. <br>

ROUVRAY: You can give them uniforms, Lieutenant, but they remain
peasants underneath. <br>

BARBARA: Yes. How did you know? <br>
JEAN: Their names? <br>
BARBARA: D'Argenson. <br>
JULES: And Rouvray. <br>
JEAN: They must have discovered our escape route, Jules. <br>
JULES: They may have just been unlucky. We'll wait till we've heard
from Leon. The route is his responsibility. Were d'Argenson and Rouvray
brought back with you? <br>
BARBARA: No. There was a fight with the soldiers. They were shot. <br>
JEAN: Soldiers? Jules, this isn't the first time. <br>
JULES: Oh, later, later. <br>
JEAN: Someone's informing on us. <br>
JULES: Later, Jean. <br>
SUSAN: You knew those men, didn't you? <br>
JULES: Hmm? Yes. Yes, we did. We rescued them as we did you. In their
case our effort was wasted. <br>
BARBARA: So this isn't the first time you've risked your life? <br>
JEAN: Not all Frenchmen can allow innocent people to be led to the
guillotine, Barbara. Jules has saved many lives. <br>
JULES: It would appear that my that luck is running out. <br>
JEAN: Luck? Not if what I say is true. <br>
JULES: I shall sort it out, Jean. Now, you say your Grandfather was
left here. <br>
SUSAN: Yes, in that house. <br>
JULES: Then I shall send someone to search for him as soon as I can. <br>
BARBARA: There were four of us all together. Ian, as I've already told
you, is still in the prison. <br>
JULES: I promise you, I give you my word, that I will not rest until
the four of you have been brought together again. <br>
BARBARA: Headache again? <br>
SUSAN: Ah, yes. It keeps coming and going. <br>
JULES: The young lady needs sleep. Danielle? <br>
BARBARA: If you could show me where <br>
JULES: Danielle will escort you. <br>
DANIELLE: Oh yes, come with me. You look worn out. <br>

JULES: Leon! It's good to see you. <br>
JEAN: D'Argenson and Rouvray were taken. <br>
JULES: Not now, Jean. Well Leon, what's wrong? <br>
LEON: There is a man. A stranger. He's been asking for you. <br>
JULES: Oh? <br>
LEON: He's being watched. He's by the inn near the prison. We thought
you should know. <br>
JULES: Yes, thank you. We'll take care of it. <br>
JULES: Oh Barbara, this is a good friend of mine, Leon. Barbara. She's
here with a young friend. They're staying with us for a few days. <br>
BARBARA: I'm pleased to meet you. <br>
(Leon kisses Barbara's hand) <br>
LEON: Hello. <br>
JULES: We're slipping out for a while, Barbara. It won't be for long. <br>
LEON: I'll take good care of her, Jules. <br>
JULES: Come, Jean. Don't delay. <br>

ROBESPIERRE: Send Citizen LeMaitre in. <br>
LEMAITRE: Here is the complete and detailed list of the recent
executions, Citizen. <br>
ROBESPIERRE: Who is this, LeMaitre? <br>
LEMAITRE: A Regional Deputy visiting from our southern province,
Citizen. And as the province in question is to be discussed, I thought
the Citizen could make his report personally. <br>
ROBESPIERRE: I see. I am always prepared to listen to a first-hand
account of a region's situation. <br>
DOCTOR: I welcome the opportunity. Thank you. Before you question me,
perhaps you would like to hear my views on Paris? <br>
ROBESPIERRE: When did you arrive? <br>
DOCTOR: Just today. <br>
ROBESPIERRE: Hardly long enough for you to have gauged the present mood
of our capital. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't say that. <br>
ROBESPIERRE: I am only interested in your comments on your own
territory. Recent memoranda from your province suggest that the purge
of our enemies in your region is progressing very slowly. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you've reached that conclusion. Hmm. Well, perhaps we have
fewer enemies in our region, and it maybe that Paris can take an
example from us, hmm? <br>
ROBESPIERRE: We in Paris are aware of the danger, Citizen. We live in
troubled times. There is much, much work to be done, work that is
constantly delayed by the need to ferret out the traitors that we
harbour in our midst. <br>
DOCTOR: Is there such a need, Citizen Robespierre? Hmm? I mean, what
can this reign of terror possibly gain? For every opponent you put to
the guillotine, two more will spring up! <br>
LEMAITRE: I think you have said enough, Citizen. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, you do, do you? <br>
ROBESPIERRE: Let him speak, LeMaitre. What he said is true. My enemies
do multiply. He is only warning me of the dangers I face. <br>
LEMAITRE: As you wish, Citizen. <br>
ROBESPIERRE: I could, and I shall, do great things for France. For too
long the Nobility have kept our people to heel. And now finally, my
world is at power, what happens? My colleagues, my trusted friends,
plot for power. <br>
DOCTOR: Do they? Or is it just their wish to keep their heads, hmm? <br>
ROBESPIERRE: Danton planned to restore the monarchy. I had the proof, I
knew! I had to dispose of him. And the Girondins. Even now, Convention
members are at work, plotting my downfall. But I will triumph, even if
I have to execute every last one of them! Death, always death. Do you
think I want this carnage? Three hundred and forty two executions in
nine days in Paris alone. What a memory I shall leave behind if this
thing lasts. You must come again, Citizen. We never did talk about your
province. <br>
DOCTOR: No we didn't, did we, and I was so looking forward to it. It's
a pity we talked for so long about Paris. <br>

IAN: That was for an entirely different reason. Do you know a man
called Webster? <br>
JULES: No. <br>
IAN: I shared a cell with him in prison. Unfortunately he died. He
asked me to contact a man called James Stirling. <br>
JULES: James Stirling. No, I'm afraid that name means nothing to me
either. <br>
IAN: What? You mean to say you don't know him? <br>
JULES: No. Should I? <br>
IAN: Well, I don't know. I somehow took it for granted that you would. <br>
JULES: Perhaps you'd better tell me the complete story. <br>
IAN: Yes. <br>
JULES: Over a glass of wine. <br>
IAN: Well, as far as I know, Webster was an Englishman who'd come over
to France to persuade Stirling to return to England. Stirling must be a
spy. <br>
JEAN: I'll share one drink, then I must start my journey. <br>
JULES: Thank you. Yes, you should leave before dawn. Your health, Ian. <br>
IAN: Well, as I told you, Webster was dying. But before he died, he
begged me to get a message to James Stirling. I asked him, how would I
recognise him? And he told me to contact you at the sign of Le Chien
Gris. <br>
JEAN: I see. Well, Webster is right there. It is an inn that we
frequent. I'm sorry, please go on. <br>
IAN: No, that's all there is to say. Except that, as I found Le Chien
Gris, you found me. <br>
JULES: Did Webster know Stirling? <br>
IAN: Oh, I imagine so. <br>
JEAN: Probably by sight. <br>
JULES: But if as you say Stirling is a spy, to do his job properly he
must be able to move around freely. That would mean an alias, a
completely new identity. <br>
IAN: What, something that Webster didn't know? <br>
JULES: Yes, exactly. <br>
IAN: So Webster was counting on recognising him? <br>
JULES: Well, that makes good sense. <br>
IAN: Yes, well why did he ask me to contact you? <br>
JULES: Men like Webster have been in touch with me before. I imagine
the English are giving me as a contact to people they send over in case
they need help. <br>
IAN: That's not going to help me find Stirling, is it? <br>
JULES: What's the matter, eh? <br>
JEAN: I'm not sure I like the idea of being used by the English. You
shouldn't either, Jules. We're at war! And they're our enemies, and
here we are helping their spies. <br>
JULES: England is at war with the people ruling France, Jean. So are
we. When the tyranny ends, so will the war. <br>

IAN: Good. <br>

search for the fourth member of your party, Susan's grandfather. <br>

JULES: No, but he will start at the house where you were arrested and
follow the trail from there, won't you, Jean? <br>
JEAN: Yes, I will find him. <br>

LEMAITRE: I could have had you arrested any time I wanted! <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Why didn't you? (puts the ring on his finger) <br>
LEMAITRE: Please, please, keep it. Why didn't I? Well, with the
political situation as it is, and my position being what it is, I need
friends even if they're enemies. People I can call on for help. If I
have something on them, so much the better. <br>
DOCTOR: It's become quite obvious to me why you didn't wish me to leave
the prison. <br>
LEMAITRE: I knew I'd never see you again if you did. <br>
DOCTOR: But you relaxed the regulations today, and I could have walked
out any time I wished. <br>
LEMAITRE: And left your granddaughter? Just an assumption, but
obviously correct. I knew I had you so long as she remained here under
lock and key. If you remember, when I first met you, you were enquiring
after your friends. The young woman, whom the jailer says you've just
released, the girl and, what was his name? Ian. <br>
DOCTOR: So you knew all the time? <br>
LEMAITRE: Let's just say I added to my knowledge. Listening at doors
can still be effective. <br>
DOCTOR: What do you want? <br>
LEMAITRE: Ah. So I see we understand each other. If you agree to help
me, your granddaughter will be released after you have kept your side
of the bargain. <br>
DOCTOR: The least I can do is listen. <br>
LEMAITRE: Good. Now, I'm reasonably certain that your group are working
with, or for, Jules Renan. I think you used his hideout. Certainly you
know where it is, and if you don't, your granddaughter does. <br>
DOCTOR: I have never met the man! Oh, I fully appreciate why you must
want to find him, but if you think that I am going to betray him, then
you are a very poor judge of character. <br>
LEMAITRE: If you want your granddaughter released, you will have to
take me to his hideout. <br>

had to do because of what he represents. Do you ever wonder why I'm
doing these things, hiding in shadows, fighting in corners? <br>

JULES: No. No, I have no title or position. I belong, well, in the

dust. There can be no loyalty or honour where anarchy prevails. <br>

LEMAITRE: Please, I come as a friend. <br>
BARBARA: A friend? <br>
LEMAITRE: Ian will tell you that what I say is true. <br>
IAN: I will? <br>
LEMAITRE: Well, surely you realise that your escape from prison was
arranged? I saw to it that you got the key and I took care of the
jailer. <br>
IAN: Why? Why should you do that? <br>
LEMAITRE: I was certain in my own mind that Webster gave you a message
to deliver. You had to have the opportunity to deliver it.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to wait now. I have to collect.
<br>
BARBARA: Collect? <br>
LEMAITRE: Yes. I am James Stirling. <br>
IAN: Stirling? You? <br>
STIRLING: Is it so surprising? You must have already decided that to be
of any use I would have to hold some position of authority. <br>
JULES: Why have you not made yourself known here before? Webster had
been told about me. <br>
STIRLING: I've been in France several years. When I came over you must
have been unknown to us, although I'm not sure I would have contacted
you even if I could. I prefer to work alone. <br>
IAN: You could have made yourself known to me in prison. <br>
STIRLING: Yes, but I didn't know whether I could trust you. There
again, I could have been overheard. No, Ian, I took the only course
possible. <br>
DOCTOR: That's all very well, LeMaitre, Stirling, or whatever your name
is, but the only reason I brought you here was to help Susan. And I've
kept my part of the bargain. <br>
STIRLING: I know, but let me explain my position. <br>
DOCTOR: I certainly will not! I want my granddaughter out of that
prison! <br>
STIRLING: She already has been out of that prison and she was
rearrested. I will help you if you will help me. Don't you see? I can
use my authority to get safe passage for all of you to wherever you
want to go. <br>
DOCTOR: But look here. <br>
IAN: He's right, Doctor. <br>
STIRLING: No harm will come to Susan, I promise. I gave orders that she
was to remain in the cell. Now you know that's true. The jailer would
die rather than see that cell door opened again. <br>
DOCTOR: Very well. Very well. If you must, tell your story then get on
with it. <br>
STIRLING: First, the message. <br>
IAN: Oh, Webster said very little. He was badly wounded as you know. <br>
STIRLING: Yes. I know that. I read reports of all arrests in case
something like this happens. It's why I came to your cell, I realised
that he could have been Webster. I've been expecting to be contacted
for months. <br>
IAN: He didn't know where you were, or even where I could find you. <br>
STIRLING: No. The plan was that he was to look for and recognise me. He
was a good friend. Ian, the message? <br>
IAN: He said you were to return to England immediately. It seems that
whatever information you have is wanted there urgently. <br>
STIRLING: Nothing more? <br>
IAN: That was all Webster said. <br>
STIRLING: Are you sure? <br>
IAN: Well, he mumbled occasionally. Odd words. But what I've just told
you was all he asked me to tell you. <br>
STIRLING: What were these mumblings about? <br>
IAN: Oh, well, they didn't really make sense. He was unconscious. He
said strange things. I can't really remember now. <br>
STIRLING: He may have realised that he didn't have very much time. <br>
IAN: Yes. I'm afraid I can't remember them. <br>
STIRLING: Well, I'm already planning my return to England, but before I
go, and before I can give Susan and you safe passage, there is one more
piece of information I must have. <br>
BARBARA: But you asked for our help. What can we do? You have all the
power. <br>
STIRLING: Robespierre sent for me today. There is another plot to
depose him. <br>
JULES: Good. Will it succeed, do you think? <br>
STIRLING: Possibly. He gave orders that I should follow Paul Barrass, a
deputy, and report back on a meeting. <br>
IAN: Barrass. Meeting. Webster did speak of that. <br>
STIRLING: What did he say? <br>
IAN: Well, nothing specific but he said Barrass, meeting, and something
about a sinking ship. No. No, The Sinking Ship. That was it! <br>
JULES: Just a moment. There's an inn called the Sinking Ship on the
Calais Road. It would be ideal for a secret meeting. <br>
STIRLING: Right. Better than following him, we can plan a reception
committee. If I can discover the results of this meeting, I'm ready to
return to England and I'm free to help you. <br>
BARBARA: Have you any idea who Barrass is meeting? <br>
STIRLING: No, but whoever he is, he could be the next ruler of France. <br>
IAN: I still don't understand why you need our help. <br>
STIRLING: Barrass knows me by sight, I'm sure of that. He could even
know of you, Doctor. Now my plan, if you agree, is for Barbara and Ian
to attend the meeting. <br>
DOCTOR: Nonsense! It's far too risky. <br>
JULES: Why not use your own men? You would still learn the details. <br>
STIRLING: True but then they would also know and they may talk. Then I
have no advantage. <br>
BARBARA: I think we should go. Ian? <br>
IAN: It's risky, but we're not going to get away without help. <br>
DOCTOR: Quite so, and there's Susan to think about. <br>
STIRLING: Then you agree to go? <br>
BARBARA: Yes. <br>
IAN: We agree. <br>
STIRLING: The Doctor and I will remain here. If we're seen it could
hinder you, or worse. <br>
JULES: I'll take them to the inn, Stirling, if you've no objection. <br>
STIRLING: Good. I was going to ask you to. Now, when you get there I
suggest that the innkeeper. <br>
JULES: You can leave it to us, Stirling. <br>
STIRLING: Sorry. I know I can. You should have little difficulty
getting there tonight. Stay the night and return here tomorrow morning.
That way you won't run into any patrols. Now, where exactly is this
inn, Jules? <br>
JULES: It's a good two hours ride. We'll take the Calais road and ride
due north. When we reach this fork we'll see a forest. We'll circle it
and ride west.

Robespierre. He has a talent for commanding support. <br>

NAPOLEON: As far as I'm concerned, your success or failure means very
little to me. <br>

well mean that I would take control of the governing
committee. <br>

of your disgust for
politicians, tearing France to pieces while her enemies wait to pounce.

BARRASS: I believe that to rule a country successfully, one needs a
certain support from the people being governed. <br>
NAPOLEON: Agreed. And how do you plan to raise that support? <br>

Wars have made you a public figure. You're a hero in the people's eyes.

capacity would you require me to serve? <br>

BARRASS: You're in a strong position, Bonaparte, but hardly
indispensible. There are other young men equally ambitious. <br>

to come back. You thought you'll get away with it. <br>
JAILER: Get away with what? <br>
DOCTOR: Being LeMaitre's accomplice. Take him! You were LeMaitre's
accomplice, weren't you? You did help him to carry out his torturous
actions? <br>
JAILER: I only carried out the orders I was given, Citizen. <br>
DOCTOR: Orders? Orders? Don't tell me that, my man, I was there,
remember? I saw you
conniving with him all the time. <br>
JAILER: I didn't, Citizen. <br>
DOCTOR: Didn't what? <br>
JAILER: Do what you just said. <br>
DOCTOR: It was you that betrayed me to LeMaitre, was it not? <br>
JAILER: Well, after all, Citizen, you did hit me on the head. And how
was I to know LeMaitre was a traitor? And, well, you, Citizen, you,
well, that was a secret wasn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose there's some logic in that. I can't decide
whether you're a rogue or a half-wit or both. Ha. However, I will give
you the benefit of the doubt. (to the guards) Get out. Now, while we're
reconsidering the post of jailer you may stay here in a temporary
capacity. <br>
JAILER: Thank you, Citizen. You won't regret it, I promise you. <br>
DOCTOR: I hope not. Now, Robespierre's friends smuggled him away after
the convention. The soldiers are after him. He will be caught and
probably brought here. <br>
JAILER: Ah, well we'll look after him, Citizen. Never fear. <br>
DOCTOR: Tomorrow there will be a new bunch of prisoners, Robespierre's
friends, so I hope everything will be ready, including the cells? <br>
JAILER: Well, shall I release the prisoners, Citizen? <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly. Now let me have the key to the dungeon. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Barbara sees soldiers arrive at the prison gates) <br>
SOLDIER: Open up! We've got Robespierre! <br>
IAN: The Doctor back yet? <br>
BARBARA: No. But they've got Robespierre! I've just seen them take him
into the prison. <br>
STIRLING: Yes, we followed them here. Perhaps I'd better go and see
what's happened. <br>
IAN: You stay where you are, Stirling. You set one foot inside that
prison and you'll be arrested. We must wait until Jules arrives with
the carriage. <br>
BARBARA: And you obviously didn't get to Robespierre. <br>
IAN: No. <br>
STIRLING: We saw him taken. He was shot in the jaw. <br>
IAN: Jules going to be able to see us from here? <br>
BARBARA: I think so. At least this storm will allow him to pull up in
front of the prison. <br>
STIRLING: I shall be heading for Calais. I can get a boat from there. <br>
IAN: Good. We can save you some time. We go the same way. <br>
STIRLING: While we're waiting, you might as well explain exactly where
it is you're making for. <br>
BARBARA: Well, as far as I can remember from the map I saw in the
hideout, we head north of Paris. <br>
IAN: Here's Jules!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor lets Susan out of the cell) <br>
SUSAN: Oh, Grandfather! <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. There, Susan. We're all going back to the ship. It's all
over for you. <br>
SUSAN: Where are the others? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Barbara's outside and Ian should arrive at any moment. We
have a carriage waiting. <br>
SUSAN: A carriage? Oh, that's better than a tumbril. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I. <br>
SUSAN: What's happening? <br>
DOCTOR: They've just heard about the downfall of Robespierre. A sort of
celebration, you know? <br>
SUSAN: Oh, look! <br>
(Robespierre is dragged in) <br>
SOLDIER: Jailer! <br>
JAILER: Yes. What is it about? <br>
SOLDIER: A prisoner for you. <br>
JAILER: Oh, Citizen Robespierre? This is indeed an honour. <br>
SOLDIER: Don't waste your breath on him. He can't answer you back. He
tried writing us a letter but, too bad we don't read, hey? <br>
SUSAN: Let's go back to the Tardis. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, Susan. The rabble are far too busy to bother about
us. Everybody lived in fear yesterday of that man, and
today. Let's go, Susan. Let's go. <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JULES: Yes, the fall of Robespierre has changed
everything for me. <br>
IAN: I'm sure it has, Jules. What are you going to do now? <br>
JULES: First I must find Jean. Then I shall wait somewhere in the
country and see how this situation in Paris develops. <br>
IAN: Going to be disturbed for a long time, I think. <br>
JULES: Yes, I know. I wonder who will emerge as the next ruler of
France? <br>
IAN: Remember the name, Napoleon Bonaparte. <br>
JULES: Corsican? Ruling France? <br>
STIRLING: Well, if you're certain that's where you want to be left. <br>
BARBARA: That's the place. We'll be safe there. <br>
STIRLING: Yes, but I don't <br>
BARBARA: Please. No questions. Promise? <br>
STIRLING: Very well, if that's what you want. Now that I'm going home,
I just can't wait to see England again. <br>
BARBARA: Oh, England. I know how you feel only too well. <br>
STIRLING: Why don't you all come with me? <br>
BARBARA: Er, no. We must travel our way. <br>
STIRLING: Barbara, who are you really? Where do you all come from? <br>
JULES: Here they are! <br>
IAN: He's got Susan! <br>
SUSAN: Ian! <br>
DOCTOR: Now come along. Don't stand around. It's too dangerous. <br>
IAN: Come along. Hurry. <br>
JULES: Come LeMaitre. We mustn't keep them waiting. I hope they have a
pleasant journey. <br>
STIRLING: So do I. But to where, Jules? Funny, I get the impression
they don't know where they're heading for. Come to that, do any of us?

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOCTOR: Well, I can assure you, my dear Barbara,
Napoleon would never have believed you. <br>
IAN: Yes, Doctor, but supposing we had written Napoleon a letter,
telling him, you know, some of the things that were going to happen to
him. <br>
SUSAN: It wouldn't have made any difference, Ian. He'd have forgotten
it, or lost it, or thought it was written by a maniac. <br>
BARBARA: I suppose if we'd tried to kill him with a gun, the bullet
would have missed him. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, it's hardly fair to speculate, is it? No, I'm afraid you
belittle things. Our lives are important, at least to us. But as we
see, so we learn. <br>
IAN: And what are we going to see and learn next, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, unlike the old adage, my boy, our destiny is in the
stars, so let's go and search for it.
