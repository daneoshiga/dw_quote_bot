beard is making his way through the scrubby vegetation, half hidden by
the mist. He is out of breath and frightened.) <br>
MARSHAL [OC]: Over here! Move in! Path! He's heading to the path! This
way! Over here! <br>
(A slightly portly man in black uniform with silver trim, helmet and
breathing mask is carrying a device which is bleeping. He rips off the
mask and shouts.) <br>
MARSHAL: Mutt! Mutt! Hurry, you men. Hurry! Mutt! <br>
(The mist clears to reveal the old man a little way ahead. The Marshal
gives chase, dropping his mask. One of his men picks it up.) <br>
STUBBS: Sir! Marshal, your mask! <br>
COTTON: (a dark man) Mutt mad he is. Sport to him. <br>
STUBBS: Kill one before he passes out. <br>
COTTON: Solos. Stinking rotten hole. Can't even breathe. What a planet.
<br>
STUBBS: Not long now, soldier. <br>
COTTON: Should have given them independence years ago. <br>
(The old man lies face down by a muddy. There are two rows of
protuberances down his spine.) <br>
MARSHAL: Look at it. Disgusting mess. Get rid of it. <br>
STUBBS: Sir. <br>
MARSHAL: Make out a report. Mutt found dead, as usual. <br>
(The Marshal moves away and Stubbs pulls a communicator from the front
of his uniform.) <br>
STUBBS: Stubbs calling Skybase. Returning shortly. ETA forty two zero
six. Have dealt with mutant native alert, area seven. Mutant tracked
and found dead on arrival. Cause unknown.

DOCTOR: Mmm? <br>
JO: Are you going to be very much longer? <br>
DOCTOR: No, nearly finished, Jo. <br>
JO: What are you doing anyway? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm making a minimum inertia superdrive for Bessie. <br>
JO: Oh. Well, for your information, it's well past lunch time, and I'm <br>

DOCTOR: No. <br>
JO: Bomb? <br>
DOCTOR: No, nothing so exciting. <br>
JO: Well? <br>
DOCTOR: It's an assignment. <br>
JO: Well then, it is exciting. <br>
DOCTOR: No, it's a container of some kind, Jo, from them. <br>
JO: Time Lords? <br>
DOCTOR: That's right. <br>
JO: Well, aren't you going to open it? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not allowed to open it. <br>
JO: Huh? <br>
DOCTOR: I couldn't, even if I wanted to. No, I'm not meant to. I
couldn't open it, even if I wanted to. No, it's only meant for one
person, and or creature. It will only open for one person. <br>
JO: And or creature. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's right. Yes, I'm just the messenger boy. <br>
JO: Well, can't you just refuse? <br>
DOCTOR: They only send these things in a real emergency, Jo. It's top
priority, a three line whip. No, I've got to go. <br>
JO: How do you know where to deliver it? <br>
(The Tardis roof light flashes and she starts humming with energy. The
door opens on its own.) <br>
DOCTOR: I think that has already been decided. <br>
JO: Hang on, wait for me. I'm coming too. <br>
DOCTOR: That's out of the question. It's bound to be dangerous,
probably difficult. <br>
JO: All the more reason. You need me to look after you. <br>
DOCTOR: Sorry, Jo, a lot of rubbish. Not this time. Au revoir! <br>
(The Doctor enters the Tardis.) <br>
JO: Oh, no you don't! <br>

dematerialises.)

of Discovery, the spaceship in 2001, orbits the planet Solos. The
Tardis materialises in a quiet room containing a few white storage
units, and with one large blue oval door in the wall.) <br>
JO: Well, where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: It looks like the tradesman's entrance, doesn't it. <br>
JO: What do you mean? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't see any red carpet, do you? <br>

JO: Doctor, look. We're flying. <br>

peaks pushing through.) <br>

DOCTOR: A Skybase. <br>
JO: Amazing. <br>

visiting party. <br>
DOCTOR: We are expected then. <br>
MAN [OC]: Next, escort them through bacteriological decontamination

out of a doorway labelled Solonians and is greeted by another of his
kind. Another doorway is labelled Overlords. Black uniformed guards
stand around.) <br>
VARAN JR: Father. <br>
(The Solonian doorway glows blue and another man in less armour comes
out.) <br>
VARAN: Greetings, Ky. <br>
KY: I knew you would be here, Varan, with your Overlord masters. <br>
VARAN: And why are you here? <br>
KY: I was summoned. <br>
VARAN: You will attend the conference? <br>
KY: The conference? More lies from the Overlords. More promises of
freedom. <br>
VARAN: Yet Ky still came? <br>
KY: I came to demand that the Overlords stop murdering our people. <br>
VARAN: The mutants must be rooted out. They are evil and diseased. <br>
KY: Who tells us that? <br>
VARAN: My eyes tell me. <br>
KY: No, Varan, the Overlords tell you. They tell you to kill and you
kill. <br>
VARAN: My people are warriors. It is honourable to fight. <br>
KY: Where is the honour in hunting down unarmed creatures? <br>
VARAN: It is their duty, Ky. They are diseased. <br>
KY: If it is a disease, what has caused it? Once we were farmers and
hunters. The land was green, the rivers ran clear, the air was sweet to
breathe. And then the Overlords came, bringing Earth's poisons with
them, calling it progress. We toiled in their mines, we became slaves.
Worse than slaves! <br>
VARAN: Liar! <br>
KY: Murderer! You have nothing else to hunt, so you hunt your own kind.
<br>
(Ky and Varan square up to fight. Varan reaches for his sword and a
guard intervenes.) <br>
STUBBS: So you've arrived, Ky. <br>
KY: As you see, Overlord. We come when we are called. <br>
STUBBS: Well, don't just stand there making speeches, get into
decontamination. <br>
(Stubbs indicates an area through a large archway.) <br>
STUBBS: And the rest of you. Varan, the Marshal wants to see you. <br>
(Varan's bodyguard makes to follow his leader through a second
archway.) <br>
STUBBS: Alone. <br>
VARAN: Wait. <br>
(Varan leaves. Stubbs leaves down a corridor past Decontamination. A
guard moves over to the bodyguard and grabs his arm. The bodyguard does
not have a normal hand.) <br>
GUARD: Mutt! <br>

Jo, where? Oh, they you are. <br>
(Jo comes from behind the Tardis.) <br>
JO: Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm? <br>
JO: Are you sure we're in the reception area? Looks more like a broom
cupboard. Where exactly are we, time wise? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't use expressions like that, Jo, please. <br>
JO: All right, century wise. <br>
DOCTOR: According to the Tardis's instrument readings, we are now in
the thirtieth century empire. <br>
JO: I see. What empire? <br>
DOCTOR: Your empire. Earth's empire. Yes, great colonists, Earthmen,
you know, Jo. Once they'd sacked the solar system, they moved onto
pastures new. Solos is one of them. One of the last. Did you ever read
Gibbon's Decline and Fall? <br>
JO: No. Is it good? <br>
DOCTOR: Jo, this is like that. You see? <br>
JO: No. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, empires rise and empires fall. And if this is their
idea of a reception, this one has obviously crumbled. <br>
(The Doctor goes to the door. On the left is a panel with a hand print
on it.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, if we're to get out of here, I've obviously got to try
and break the circuit. <br>

him there and then. <br>

STUBBS [OC]: He was Varan's bodyguard, sir. <br>
MARSHAL: Varan's bodyguard? Get me a full report at once. Hold the
other two, and get Varan. <br>
(The Marshal's communicator is the top of his swagger stick. He shuts
it off as a man in a long black coat enters.) <br>
MARSHAL: I've asked for a full report, Administrator. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I should think so. What happened to your security
arrangements? And why wasn't I informed that Varan was here? Really,
Marshal, on the eve of the independence conference.
(Everyone say Hi! to Geoffrey Palmer.) <br>
MARSHAL: They'll be a full security clampdown. The Solonians will never
know. As for Varan, he was merely reporting on Ky's activities. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Spying for you, you mean. <br>
MARSHAL: All part of security. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Security? Such as we had tonight? Natives and the devil
knows who else running amok. Good heavens, man, we're not at war with
the Solonians. We're giving them independence. <br>
MARSHAL: Oh, eventually. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Not eventually, Marshal, now. Total and absolute
independence. We're pulling out. <br>
MARSHAL: Pulling out? <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: I take it you've been too busy with security to study
the latest reports from Earth? We can't afford an empire any more.
Earth is exhausted, Marshal. Finished. Politically, economically and
biologically finished. <br>
MARSHAL: Then why go back? We could keep Skybase on Solos, take over
the whole planet. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Out of the question. Apart from the Solonians
themselves, there's the problem of the atmosphere. <br>
MARSHAL: Well, they're both problems that can be solved. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Ky's already making political capital out of your
experiments in that field. <br>
MARSHAL: The mutants. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Exactly. <br>
MARSHAL: There is no proof that my atmospheric experiments have
anything at all to do with these mutations. The Mutts are a menace and
must be wiped out. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: And that's your alternative to independence? Genocide? <br>
MARSHAL: Give them independence, they'll starve out of total
incompetence. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Nevertheless, they shall have their independence.
Whether they're ready for it or not. <br>
MARSHAL: When you summoned this conference, Administrator, I assumed it
for your usual line. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Which is? <br>
MARSHAL: Fob them off with promises, a few minor concessions. It's
always worked before. <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Well, this time I'm conceding all Ky's demands. <br>
MARSHAL: But <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: We have no choice. We must return to Earth. <br>
MARSHAL: But I've put years of my life into this planet. The whole, my
whole career <br>
ADMINISTRATOR: Yeah, well, I'm afraid things are going to be a bit
tricky for ex-colonial officials. Still, don't worry, old chap. We'll
find you something. The Bureau of Records, perhaps. Something clerical.

concept. Two different cultures, far apart in terms of development <br>

JAEGER: But these aren't military rockets. <br>
DOCTOR: Try telling the Solonians that. <br>
JAEGER: I can't understand your concern, Doctor. This planet, as it
stands, is no longer of any use unless we make the atmosphere
breathable. <br>
DOCTOR: Even if it means wiping out every Solonian in the process? <br>
JAEGER: Earth is fighting for its survival. The side-effects are of no
importance! <br>
DOCTOR: Genocide is a side-effect? You ought to write a paper on that,
Professor. <br>
JAEGER: Perhaps you have an alternative suggestion? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps. <br>
JAEGER: Particle reversal, no doubt. Your little forte? <br>
DOCTOR: Particle reversal is one way. Not as violent as yours, of
course, but the result will be the same. <br>
JAEGER: The question is, Doctor, can it be done? <br>

COTTON: That's it, sir. You can't. We didn't find her. <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
COTTON: As far as we know, she's still with Ky. <br>

that? <br>
COTTON: All the guards have orders to stop you leaving this section. <br>
DOCTOR: Is there any other way to the transfer station? <br>
COTTON: Afraid not, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: Cotton, is there an emergency power supply to the transfer
station? <br>
COTTON: Yes, it. Why, sir? <br>
DOCTOR: What would happen if I blew the main power supply to the whole
of Skybase? <br>
COTTON: Sheer chaos. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. But if the emergency power supply to the transfer
station were already switched over. <br>
COTTON: You could slip down to Solos in the confusion. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Can you get the power switched over? <br>
COTTON: I can try. <br>
DOCTOR: Good, now I'll tell you what I want you to do <br>

JAEGER: Cotton, who told you that the Marshal wanted to see me? <br>
COTTON: He did, sir. <br>
JAEGER: Then one of you must be mad. <br>
COTTON: Oh, yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Maybe he changed his mind, sir. <br>
(Cotton leaves.) <br>
DOCTOR: Professor, I've been thinking. Perhaps we could try an
experiment, just to prove whether I'm right or wrong about particle
reversal. <br>
JAEGER: Good. <br>
DOCTOR: But we'll need to link up to the main power supply.

Oh, it's natural in a thaesium mine, and it's not dangerous, unless
you're here for many years, as I am, or unless you find yourself in an
unstable zone, as you did, young lady. The entrance you found led you
straight to the heart of the most dangerous radioactivity. <br>
JO: So it was you I saw, and you brought me out. <br>
SONDERGAARD: Ha! I didn't know what to do. I couldn't let you die, so I
carried you as quickly as I could out of the radioactive zone to where
I hoped your friends would find you. <br>

KY: You were given up for dead years ago. <br>
SONDERGAARD: Yes, so were many others in the mines. The mutants, for
example. <br>
JO: The mutants? Well, they attacked us and tried to kill us. <br>
SONDERGAARD: Yes, I know. There are more now, many more, and as their
numbers increase, so it seems does their aggression. Oh, it's not an
isolated phenomenon. The same behaviour may be observed in rats when
confined. <br>
KY: And who did this to my people? Who hunted them down like wild
animals? The Overlords! <br>
DOCTOR: This, er, increase in aggression that you speak of. It seems to
be spreading. <br>
KY: Aggression, yes! And who were the first aggressors? <br>
DOCTOR: Ky! This is not a political meeting. We're all on your side,
you know, all of us. <br>
KY: Him? Why does he hide in these caves? To experiment on my people! <br>
DOCTOR: Look, give him a chance to explain! <br>
JO: Please, Ky. <br>
SONDERGAARD: Well, he has my sympathies. Do you think I've chosen to
live here? To work with this primitive equipment? I was young,
ambitious. I hoped to make many great discoveries here. And my first
was that Solos had become a slave colony. I was unwise enough to try to
inform Earth control. The Marshal intercepted my report. I was lucky to
escape with my life. I managed to reach the caves. I've been here ever
since. <br>
DOCTOR: But you have continued with your research? <br>
SONDERGAARD: As well as I could. As you see, I lack equipment. If it
were not for the mutants, I would not have been able to survive here. <br>
KY: My people help you? <br>
SONDERGAARD: They did. We were all outcasts. We helped one another.
Once they stole food for me, and clothing. <br>
DOCTOR: And now? <br>
SONDERGAARD: Now they don't come near me. It is as if I were <br>
KY: Diseased? <br>
SONDERGAARD: Who knows? Perhaps they're right. Strange things are
happening on Solos, Doctor. Oh, not just to the people, but to the
plants, the soil, the atmosphere, even the weather. The whole flora and
fauna of Solos. <br>
(The Doctor looks at specimens of plants in jars.) <br>
DOCTOR: Professor Jaeger's experiments. <br>
SONDERGAARD: Exactly, and my belief is this. At first the changes were
natural, but now Professor Jaeger's experiments have accelerated the
changes and something is seriously wrong. <br>

(The four make their way up a passage. Jo stumbles and sees a mutant
some way behind them.) <br>
SONDERGAARD: Now then, this pattern repeated is almost the same, and
this is the Solonian sun symbol. <br>

try something else. Fire, earth, air, water. No, all right, that's no
good. <br>

you too busy playing soldiers? <br>
MARSHAL: Guards, wait outside. You'll forgive a short postponement, I

JAEGER: Here are the figures. Total failure! Every one of those rockets
malfunctioned in one way or another. If they had been properly checked
out as I insisted, Marshal. <br>
MARSHAL: Jaeger, what happened? <br>
JAEGER: I'll tell you what happened. None of the ionisation rockets
exploded in the atmosphere. Every single one hit the surface! <br>
MARSHAL: So? <br>
JAEGER: So? Instead of seeding the atmosphere with ionisation crystals,
the planet's surface itself has been contaminated. You've made yourself
master of a desert, Marshal. A lethal desert. No one will be able to
set foot on Solos for centuries now, once the crystals have taken
effect. No one! Not you and certainly not the Investigator! <br>
MARSHAL: Jaeger, will you shut up! <br>
JAEGER: As for this display of megalomania, how do you hope to conceal
it from the Investigator? They are not all of them as loyal as those

MARSHAL: My men do as I tell them. <br>
STUBBS: That's not true, Marshal. Cotton and I aren't the only ones,
you know. <br>
JO: The Investigator's going to find out everything. The Administrator
assassinated, native leaders dead or missing and a contaminated planet.
Now that's not a very successful record, is it, Marshal? <br>
MARSHAL: Very good, Miss Grant. Very convincing. You forget one thing.
The Investigator still has to get here, and his ship is no match for
Skybase. <br>
STUBBS: Agreed, you could dispose of the Investigator too. But how
reliable are your rockets, Professor? As for the advance warning
system, the Doctor and Miss Grant landed, Marshal, landed without being
detected. And the Doctor's still free. <br>
MARSHAL: Doctor! Always the Doctor! <br>
JO: But no one else can help you, or Solos for that matter. Do you
think we didn't know about the Investigator? Well, why do you think we
were sent? He's coming to confirm the Doctor's findings. <br>

convert the atmosphere to one breathable by humans, but not by the
native population. <br>
JAEGER: Nonsense. <br>
INVESTIGATOR: And further, that these experiments were the root cause
of the outbreak of mutation. Well? <br>

JAEGER: And I rest my case on scientific proof only. Your scientists
have made their own tests. The atmosphere of Solos is exactly as it
always was. As for the Mutts, er, as for the mutants, I regret that so
far we have found no solution to the problem. <br>

exist. <br>
MARSHAL: Where? Where is your proof? <br>
DOCTOR: This present mutation is one of a series of adaptive changes,
sir. Solos is moving out of spring into summer, and that is why the
Solonians are changing. <br>

INVESTIGATOR: What is the meaning of this interruption? Who is this

DOCTOR: This, sir, this is Professor Sondergaard, who's worked and
lived on Solos for many years. He can tell you better than I what the
Marshal has been doing there. <br>
SONDERGAARD: Doctor, I don't understand. What's happening here? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Professor. We're holding a much needed
investigation. Thank heavens you've arrived just in time to tell the
Investigator of our discoveries. <br>
SONDERGAARD: Oh, yes, of course. Well, I'm sure the Doctor will have
told you of our work in the cave, and he will also have told you that
we now realise what's made so many of these mutations to go wrong. <br>
INVESTIGATOR: Wrong? But the Doctor has said it was a natural process.
Why wrong? <br>
SONDERGAARD: Well, you see <br>
MARSHAL: There you see? Even Sondergaard admits it. The mutants are
evil! Must be destroyed! <br>
(Down on Solos, a mutant finally gets into a transfer cubicle and
activates it. Up on Skybase it goes off looking for Sondergaard.) <br>
SONDERGAARD: I beg not to listen to this man. The mutants are not
monsters. They are the native life form of this planet, undergoing a
natural and inevitable change. This change, however, has been brought
about prematurely by that man's rash and callous experiments! <br>
JAEGER: That's a lie! Where's your evidence? <br>
(The mutant enters.) <br>
MARSHAL: Mutts! <br>
SONDERGAARD: No! There's nothing to be afraid of. The mutants are not
dangerous unless you try to harm them. <br>

would be murder! <br>
