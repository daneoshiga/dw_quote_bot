curtained-off alcove. The Doctor and Donna step out into the sunshine.
The streets are lined with vendors of various goods.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ancient Rome. Well, not for them, obviously. To all intents and
purposes, right now, this is brand new Rome. <br>
DONNA: Oh, my God. it's, it's so Roman. This is fantastic. <br>
DOCTOR: Ha, ha. <br>
DONNA: I'm here, in Rome. Donna Noble in Rome. This is just weird. I
mean, everyone here's dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, don't tell them that. <br>
DONNA: Hold on a minute. That sign over there's in English. <br>
(Painted on the side of a barrow is two amphorae for the price of one.)
<br>
DONNA: Are you having me on? Are we in Epcot? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. That's the Tardis translation circuits. Just
makes it look like English. Speech as well. You're talking Latin right
now. <br>
DONNA: Seriously? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. <br>
DONNA: I just said seriously in Latin. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. <br>
DONNA: What if I said something in actual Latin, like veni, vidi, vici?
My dad said that when he came back from football. If I said veni, vidi,
vici to that lot, what would it sound like? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm not sure. You have to think of difficult questions, don't
you? <br>
DONNA: I'm going to try it. <br>
(Donna goes to a fruit seller.) <br>
STALLHOLDER: Afternoon, sweetheart. What can I get you, my love? <br>
DONNA: Er, veni, vidi, vici. <br>
STALLHOLDER: Huh? Sorry? Me no speak Celtic. No can do, missy. <br>
DONNA: Yeah. <br>
(She walks away.) <br>
DONNA: How's he mean, Celtic? <br>
DOCTOR: Welsh. You sound Welsh. There we are. Learnt something. <br>
(A young woman with a white painted face and wearing a red cloak
watches them leave.) <br>
DONNA: Don't our clothes look a bit odd? <br>
DOCTOR: Nah. Ancient Rome, anything goes. It's like Soho, but bigger. <br>
DONNA: You've been here before then? <br>
DOCTOR: Mmm. Ages ago. Before you ask, that fire had nothing to do with
me. Well, a little bit. But I haven't got the chance to look around
properly. Coliseum, Pantheon, Circus Maximus. You'd expect them to be
looming by now. Where is everything? Try this way. <br>
(The young woman follows them through the streets until they come out
into a piazza.) <br>
DONNA: Not an expert, but there's seven hills of Rome, aren't there?
How come they've only got one? <br>
(One big, bare-headed mountain. Then the ground shakes.) <br>
MAN: Here we go again. <br>
(The vendors hang onto their stalls as pottery falls and breaks.) <br>
DONNA: Wait a minute. One mountain, with smoke. Which makes this <br>
DOCTOR: Pompeii. We're in Pompeii. And it's volcano day.

other young woman all dressed and painted in the same fashion. She
prostrates herself before the altar.) <br>
SOOTHSAYER: I beg audience with the High Priestess of the Sibylline. <br>
(Yes, it is Karen Gillan.) <br>
SPURRINA: : The High Priestess cannot be seen. What would you tell her,
sister? <br>
SOOTHSAYER: It has come, as foretold in the prophecy. The box. The blue
box.

-) <br>
DONNA: You're kidding. You're not telling me the Tardis has gone. <br>
DOCTOR: Okay. <br>
DONNA: Where is it then? <br>
DOCTOR: You told me not to tell you. <br>
DONNA: Oi. Don't get clever in Latin. <br>
DOCTOR: Hold on. <br>
(He goes to the fruit seller.) <br>
DOCTOR: Excuse me. Excuse me. There was a box. Big blue box. Big blue
wooden box, just over there. Where's it gone? <br>
STALLHOLDER: Sold it, didn't I? <br>
DOCTOR: But it wasn't yours to sell. <br>
STALLHOLDER: It was on my patch, weren't it? I got fifteen sesterces
for it. Lovely jubbly. <br>
DOCTOR: Who'd you sell it to? <br>
STALLHOLDER: Old Caecilius. Look, if you want to argue, why don't you
take it out with him? He's on Foss Street. Big villa. Can't miss it. <br>
DOCTOR: Thanks. <br>
(The Doctor leaves and returns.) <br>
DOCTOR: What'd he buy a big blue wooden box for?

CAECILIUS: Modern art. Out of the way, that's it. Oh, Rombus, I'm a
little bit peckish. Get me some ants in honey, there's a good lad. Ooo,
maybe a dormouse? <br>
(The elderly slave leaves.) <br>
CAECILIUS: What do you think? <br>
(The lady in the blue robe is not impressed.) <br>
METELLA: You call it modern art, I call it a blooming great waste of
space. <br>
CAECILIUS: We're going up in the world, my love. Lucius Dextrus himself
is coming to the house this afternoon. What with that and with our
Evelina about to be elevated. <br>
(The young lady of the house, Caecilia Evelina, enters.) <br>
EVELINA: Oh, don't go on about it, Dad. <br>
METELLA: If we'd moved to Rome like I said she could've been a Vestal
virgin. <br>
(Enter the son and heir, Quintus Caecilius Iucundus.) <br>
QUINTUS: Someone mention Vestal Virgins? <br>
METELLA: Quintus, don't be so rude. You apologise to the Household
Gods. <br>
QUINTUS: Get off. <br>
METELLA: Apologise right now. The Gods are always watching. <br>
(There is a ground tremor.) <br>
CAECILIUS: Positions! <br>
(Everyone runs to grab a precious artefact before it falls.) <br>
METELLA: There, now you've made the heavens angry. Just say sorry. I
tell you, Caecilius, that boy will do no good. <br>
(Quintus goes to the shrine and sprinkles water on the carved plaque.) <br>
QUINTUS: Sorry, Household Gods. <br>
CAECILIUS: So where were you last night? Down the thelopolium, I bet,
cavorting with Etruscans and Christians and all sorts. How's your head,
sunshine? How's your head! <br>
QUINTUS: All right, Dad. Give us a break. <br>
METELLA: You want to smarten yourself up, Quintus, before Lucius
Dextrus gets here. Look at your sister. She's giving us status. <br>
QUINTUS: Oh yeah, because it's all about Evelina. <br>
METELLA: She has the gift. <br>
(An eye tattooed on the back of her left hand.) <br>
METELLA: Be proud of your sister for once. Have you been consuming? <br>
EVELINA: Not this morning. <br>
METELLA: Come on sweetheart, practise. It's hot today. The hypocaust is
on full blast. <br>
(The women sit by a raised grill.) <br>
METELLA: The mountain God must be happy. Breathe deeply. Remember what
the sisterhood said. <br>
EVELINA: Oh, it hurts. <br>
METELLA: Oh, my love, is it too hot? <br>
EVELINA: Sometimes in the smoke I see the most terrible things. <br>
METELLA: Like what? <br>
EVELINA: A face. A face of stone. <br>
METELLA: It'll make sense one day. Sister Spurrina promised. The veil
will be parted and you'll be a seer. <br>
(Evelina inhales the fumes, and sees a creature of rock with eyes and
mouth of fire.) <br>
EVELINA: Who are you?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor runs into Donna.) <br>
DOCTOR: Ha. I've got it. Foss Street's this way. <br>
DONNA: No. Well, I found this big sort of amphitheatre thing. We can
start there. We can gather everyone together. Maybe they've got a great
big bell or something we could ring. Have they invented bells yet? <br>
DOCTOR: What do you want a bell for? <br>
DONNA: To warn everyone. Start the evacuation. What time does Vesuvius
erupt? When's it due? <br>
DOCTOR: It's 79AD, twenty third of August, which makes volcano day
tomorrow. <br>
DONNA: Plenty of time. We could get everyone out easy. <br>
DOCTOR: Yeah, except we're not going to. <br>
DONNA: But that's what you do. You're the Doctor. You save people. <br>
DOCTOR: Not this time. Pompeii is a fixed point in history. What
happens, happens. There is no stopping it. <br>
DONNA: Says who? <br>
DOCTOR: Says me. <br>
DONNA: What, and you're in charge? <br>
DOCTOR: Tardis, Time Lord, yeah. <br>
DONNA: Donna, human, no. I don't need your permission. I'll tell them
myself. <br>
DOCTOR: You stand in the market place announcing the end of the world,
they'll just think you're a mad old soothsayer. Now, come on. Tardis.
We are getting out of here. <br>
DONNA: Well, I might just have something to say about that, Spaceman. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, I bet you will. <br>
(After they leave, the Soothsayer steps out and covers her face with
her palms, tattooed
eyes over her own.) <br>
SOOTHSAYER: The tall one, he calls us mad.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Spurrina has also covered her eyes.) <br>
SPURRINA: Then he is a stranger to Pompeii. Soon he will learn. <br>
THALINA: We have found it, Sister Spurrina, in the thirteenth book of
the Sibylline
Oracles. The blue box. A temple made of wood. And yet the Sybil
foretold that the box would appear at the time of storms, and fire, and
betrayal. <br>
HIGH PRIESTESS [OC]: Sisters. <br>
(They go to a curtained area behind the altar.) <br>
SPURRINA: Reverend Mother, you should sleep. <br>
HIGH PRIESTESS [OC]: The Sibylline Oracles are wrong. <br>
SPURRINA: But we have venerated her words for generations. <br>
HIGH PRIESTESS [OC]: This is a new age. Heed my words. I predict a
future of prosperity and might. An endless empire of Pompeii, reaching
out from this city to topple Rome itself and encompass the whole, wide
world. If the Disciples of the Blue Box defy this prophecy, their blood
will run across the temple floor. <br>
(The ground shakes.) <br>
SPURRINA: The gods approve.

(The Doctor catches the marble bust first.) <br>
DOCTOR: Whoa! There you go. <br>
CAECILIUS: Thank you, kind sir. I'm afraid business is closed for the
day. I'm expecting a visitor. <br>
DOCTOR: But that's me, I'm a visitor. Hello. <br>
CAECILIUS: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: I am Spartacus. <br>
DONNA: And so am I. <br>
CAECILIUS: Mister and Mrs Spartacus. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no. We're not, we're not married. <br>
DONNA: We're not together. <br>
CAECILIUS: Oh, then brother and sister? Yes, of course. You look very
much alike. <br>
DOCTOR + DONNA: Really? <br>
CAECILIUS: I'm sorry, but I'm not open for trade. <br>
DOCTOR: And that trade would be? <br>
CAECILIUS: Marble. Lopus Caecilius. Mining, polishing and design
thereof. If you want marble, I'm your man. <br>
DOCTOR: That's good. That's good, because I'm the marble inspector. <br>
(The Doctor flashes his psychic paper.) <br>
METELLA: By the gods of commerce, an inspection. I'm sorry, sir. I do
apologise for my son. <br>
(Metella pours away Quintus' goblet of wine.) <br>
QUINTUS: Oi. <br>
CAECILIUS: And this is my good wife, Metella. I must confess, we're not
prepared for a <br>
DOCTOR: Nothing to worry about. I'm, I'm sure you've nothing to hide.
Although, frankly, that object looks rather like wood to me. <br>
METELLA: I told you to get rid of it. <br>
CAECILIUS: I only bought it today. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah, well. Caveat emptor. <br>
CAECILIUS: Oh, you're Celtic. There's lovely. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm sure it's fine, but I might have to take it off your hands
for a proper inspection. <br>
DONNA: Although while we're here, wouldn't you recommend a holiday,
Spartacus? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't know what you mean, Spartacus. <br>
DONNA: Oh, this lovely family. Mother and father and son. Don't you
think they should get out of town? <br>
CAECILIUS: Why should we do that? <br>
DONNA: Well, the volcano, for starters. <br>
CAECILIUS: What? <br>
DONNA: Volcano. <br>
CAECILIUS: What ano? <br>
DONNA: That great big volcano right on your doorstep. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, Spartacus, for shame. We haven't even greeted the household
gods yet. <br>
(He takes her aside to explain.) <br>
DOCTOR: They don't know what it is. Vesuvius is just a mountain to
them. The top hasn't blown off yet. The Romans haven't even got a word
for volcano. Not until tomorrow. <br>
DONNA: Oh, great, they can learn a new word as they die. <br>
DOCTOR: Donna, stop it. <br>
DONNA: Listen, I don't know what sort of kids you've been flying round
with in outer space, but you're not telling me to shut up. That boy,
how old is he, sixteen? And tomorrow he burns to death. <br>
DOCTOR: And that's my fault? <br>
DONNA: Right now, yes. <br>
ROMBUS: Announcing Lucius Petrus Dextrus, Chief Augur of the City
Government. <br>
(A middle aged man wearing a cloak over the right half of his body
enters.) <br>
CAECILIUS: Lucius. My pleasure, as always. <br>
METELLA: Quintus, stand up. <br>
CAECILIUS: A rare and great honour, sir, for you to come to my house. <br>
(Caecilius holds out his hand, but Lucius does not take it.) <br>
LUCIUS: The birds are flying north, and the wind is in the west. <br>
CAECILIUS: Quite. Absolutely. That's good, is it? <br>
LUCIUS: Only the grain of wheat knows where it will grow. <br>
CAECILIUS: There now, Metella. Have you ever heard such wisdom? <br>
METELLA: Never. It's an honour. <br>
CAECILIUS: Pardon me, sir. I have guests. This is Spartacus and, er,
Spartacus. <br>
LUCIUS: A name is but a cloud upon a summer wind. <br>
DOCTOR: But the wind is felt most keenly in the dark. <br>
LUCIUS: Ah. But what is the dark, other than an omen of the sun? <br>
DOCTOR: I concede that every sun must set. <br>
LUCIUS: Ha. <br>
DOCTOR: And yet the son of the father must also rise. <br>
LUCIUS: Damn. Very clever, sir. Evidently, a man of learning. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. But don't mind me. Don't want to disturb the status
quo. <br>
CAECILIUS: He's Celtic. <br>
DOCTOR: We'll be off in a minute. <br>
DONNA: I'm not going. <br>
CAECILIUS: It's ready, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: You've got to. <br>
DONNA: Well, I'm not. <br>
CAECILIUS: The moment of revelation. And here it is. <br>
(As the Doctor takes Donna to the Tardis, he looks back to see a stone
tile carved as a circuit board has just been unveiled.) <br>
CAECILIUS: Exactly as you specified. It pleases you, sir? <br>
LUCIUS: As the rain pleases the soil. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, now that's different. Who designed that, then? <br>
CAECILIUS: My Lord Lucius was very specific. <br>
DOCTOR: Where'd you get the pattern? <br>
LUCIUS: On the rain and mist and wind. <br>
DONNA: But that looks like a circuit. <br>
DOCTOR: Made of stone. <br>
DONNA: Do you mean you just dreamt that thing up? <br>
LUCIUS: That is my job, as City Augur. <br>
DONNA: What's that, then, like the mayor? <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, ha. You must excuse my friend, she's from Barcelona.
(sotto) No, but this is an age of superstition. Of official
superstition. The Augur is paid by the city to tell the future. The
wind will blow from the west? That's the equivalent of ten o'clock
news. <br>
(Evelina enters the room, swaying and pale.) <br>
EVELINA: They're laughing at us. Those two, they use words like
tricksters. They're mocking us. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, I'm not. I meant no offence. <br>
METELLA: I'm sorry. My daughter's been consuming the vapours. <br>
QUINTUS: Oh for gods, Mother. What have you been doing to her? <br>
CAECILIUS: Not now, Quintus. <br>
QUINTUS: Yeah, but she's sick. Just look at her. <br>
LUCIUS: I gather I have a rival in this household. Another with the
gift. <br>
METELLA: Oh, she's been promised to the Sibylline Sisterhood. They say
she has remarkable visions. <br>
LUCIUS: The prophecies of women are limited and dull. Only the menfolk
have the capacity for true perception. <br>
DONNA: I'll tell you where the wind's blowing right now, mate. <br>
(A small tremor.) <br>
LUCIUS: The Mountain God marks your words. I'd be careful, if I were
you. <br>
DOCTOR: Consuming the vapours, you say? <br>
EVELINA: They give me strength. <br>
DOCTOR: It doesn't look like it to me. <br>
EVELINA: Is that your opinion as a doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon? <br>
EVELINA: Doctor. That's your name. <br>
DOCTOR: How did you know that? <br>
EVELINA: And you. You call yourself Noble. <br>
METELLA: Now then, Evelina. Don't be rude. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. Let her talk. <br>
EVELINA: You both come from so far away. <br>
LUCIUS: The female soothsayer is inclined to invent all sorts of
vagaries. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh, not this time, Lucius. No, I reckon you've been
out-soothsayed. <br>
LUCIUS: Is that so, man from Gallifrey? <br>
DOCTOR: What? <br>
LUCIUS: The strangest of images. Your home is lost in fire, is it not? <br>
DONNA: Doctor, what are they doing? <br>
LUCIUS: And you, daughter of London. <br>
DONNA: How does he know that? <br>
LUCIUS: This is the gift of Pompeii. Every single oracle tells the
truth. <br>
DONNA: That's impossible. <br>
LUCIUS: Doctor, she is returning. <br>
DOCTOR: Who is? Who's she? <br>
LUCIUS: And you, daughter of London. There is something on your back. <br>
DONNA: What's that mean? <br>
EVELINA: Even the word Doctor is false. Your real name is hidden. It
burns in the stars, in the Cascade of Medusa herself. You are a Lord,
sir. A Lord of Time. <br>

METELLA: She didn't mean to be rude. She's ever such a good girl. But
when the gods speak through her. <br>
DONNA: What's wrong with her arm? <br>
METELLA: An irritation of the skin. She never complains, bless her. We
bathe it in olive oil every night. <br>
DONNA: What is it? <br>
METELLA: Evelina said you'd come from far away. Please, have you ever
seen anything like it? <br>

DONNA: It's stone.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The Doctor removes the hypocaust grill.) <br>
DOCTOR: Different sort of hypocaust? <br>
CAECILIUS: Oh, yes. We're very advanced in Pompeii. In Rome, they're
still using the old wood-burning furnaces, but we've got hot springs,
leading from Vesuvius itself. <br>
DOCTOR: Who thought of that? <br>
CAECILIUS: The soothsayers, after the great earthquake, seventeen years
ago. An awful lot of damage. But we rebuilt. <br>
DOCTOR: Didn't you think of moving away? Oh no, then again, San
Francisco. <br>
CAECILIUS: That's a new restaurant in Naples, isn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: What's that noise? <br>
CAECILIUS: Don't know. Happens all the time. They say the gods of the
Underworld are stirring. <br>
DOCTOR: But after the earthquake, let me guess. Is that when the
soothsayers started making sense? <br>
CAECILIUS: Oh, yes, very much so. I mean, they'd always been, shall we
say, imprecise? But then the soothsayers, the augurs, the haruspex, all
of them, they saw the truth again and again. It's quite amazing. They
can predict crops and rainfall with absolute precision. <br>
DOCTOR: Haven't they said anything about tomorrow? <br>
CAECILIUS: No. Why, should they? Why do you ask? <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. No reason. I'm just asking. But the soothsayers, they
all consume the vapours, yeah? <br>
CAECILIUS: That's how they see. <br>
DOCTOR: Ipso facto. <br>
CAECILIUS: Look you. <br>
DOCTOR: They're all consuming this. <br>
CAECILIUS: Dust. <br>
DOCTOR: Tiny particles of rock. They're breathing in Vesuvius. <br>

DOCTOR: Quintus, me old son. This Lucius Petrus Dextrus. Where does he
live? <br>
QUINTUS: It's nothing to do with me. <br>

QUINTUS: The liar. He told my father it was the only one. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, plenty of marble merchants in this town. Tell them all
the same thing, get all the components from different places, so no one
can see what you're building. <br>

puts on a purple robe and shawl.) <br>

think? The Goddess Venus. <br>

DONNA: Nice to see you laugh, though. What do you do in old Pompeii,
then, girls your age? You got mates? Do you go hanging about round the

not going out wearing that. <br>
(Her gown barely reached down to her knees.)<br>
EVELINA: Don't start, Dad. It's what all the girls in Rome are wearing.
See you later. <br>
CAECILIUS: Are you seeing that boy again? <br>
METELLA: Oh, look at Quintus. My son, the doctor. <br>
QUINTUS: Mum, I've told you. I'm not a doctor. Not yet. I'm just a
student of the physical sciences. <br>
METELLA: Well, that's a doctor to me. Give thanks to the household gods
before you go, there's a good boy. Come here, let me fix it. You've got
that folded all wrong. <br>
(Quintus kneels before the shrine.) <br>
QUINTUS: Thank you, household gods. Thank you for everything. <br>
(The little altar has a new carving - the Doctor, the Tardis, and
Donna.) </font> </p>
