HUCKLE: Three rigs destroyed in a month. Two of them ours, General. <br>
BRIGADIER: Brigadier, actually. <br>
(Alistair is in Scots civilian dress.) <br>
HUCKLE: Well, Brigadier, my company's lost millions. <br>
BRIGADIER: The government is equally concerned, I can assure you,
Mister Huckle, though more especially about the loss of life. <br>
HUCKLE: If this keeps up, pretty soon there won't be a man willing to
work out there. Do we have to put up with this hullabaloo? <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm afraid we've rather imposed ourselves on the landlord.
If he wants to play his pipes, there's not much I can do about it. Ah,
Mister Benton. Any news of the Doctor yet? <br>
BENTON: No, sir. Nothing yet. <br>

BENTON: As far as I know, sir, yes. <br>
BRIGADIER: You get on well with the landlord, don't you? <br>
BENTON: Well, yes, sir. I suppose I do. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, use your influence to get him to play the pipes when
we're out, will you? <br>
BENTON: Right, sir. <br>
(Benton looks out of the window.) <br>
BENTON: Oh, there's your Doctor now, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Good lord! (The Brigadier watches the tartan-clad Doctor get
out of the Range Rover followed by Sarah and Harry.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Mister Huckle. Who's the man in the driving seat? <br>
HUCKLE: Him? That's the Duke of Forgill, the local big shot. He doesn't
make things easy. He owns just about everything in this part of
Scotland, except our shore base, and frankly, he doesn't like us. Not
one little bit. <br>
(The pipes cease as the Doctor and party enter.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, welcome back, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: I want to know one thing, Brigadier. What's that? <br>
(The Doctor points to the Brigadier's lower garment.) <br>
BRIGADIER: That, Doctor, is a kilt. <br>
DOCTOR: Suits you very well. <br>
BRIGADIER: Oh, do you think so? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. <br>
SARAH: Oh, this is his Grace the Duke of Forgill. He very kindly gave
us a lift. <br>
FORGILL: I had to pass here on the way to the oil base. <br>
HUCKLE: To see me? <br>
FORGILL: To see you, Mister Hickle. <br>
HUCKLE: Huckle. <br>
FORGILL: To complain yet again about your rough necks trespassing and
poaching on my property. <br>
HUCKLE: My men have been warned, sir. If any of them are caught,
they'll be dismissed immediately. <br>
FORGILL: Let me give you a final warning. If my ghillie catches them on
my land again, they'll be shot. And that's no idle threat, Mister
Heckle. <br>
HUCKLE: I'll be expecting you, Brigadier. <br>
(Huckle slams the door on his way out.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, Mister Huckle. <br>
FORGILL: I trust the army isn't going to help these people. Is that why
you were sent here? <br>
BRIGADIER: No, sir. We're a military investigation team. <br>
FORGILL: Investigating what? <br>
BRIGADIER: I'm afraid our mission is a sensitive matter, sir. <br>
FORGILL: Official secrets and all that twaddle, eh? Well, I won't pry,
although my family have served this country for seven centuries, but
that doesn't seem to count these days, does it. Good day to you. <br>
(Forgill leaves.) <br>
BRIGADIER: What an odd man. Rather mediaeval in his ideas. <br>
DOCTOR: A man of convictions. <br>
HARRY: All the same, he did save us a long walk, sir. <br>
SARAH: Anyway, it's nice to see you again, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: And you, Miss Smith. <br>
SARAH: Though I didn't expect to see you in a kilt. <br>
BRIGADIER: My dear Miss Smith, as you remember, my name is Lethbridge
Stewart. The clan Stewart. <br>
SARAH: Oh, sorry. I thought you were doing a Doctor. <br>
BRIGADIER: What an absurd idea. <br>
DOCTOR: Brigadier, why have you called me back? I hope you've got a
very good reason. <br>
(A man wearing oil rig clothes and a lift belt is washed up on the
shore. The Doctor is sitting with his eyes closed while the Brigadier
brings him and us up to speed.) <br>
BRIGADIER: All three rigs were in this area. Therefore it seems to us <br>
DOCTOR: Brigadier, Brigadier! Have you brought me two hundred and
seventy million miles just to sort out a little trouble at sea? <br>
BRIGADIER: Three serious disasters, Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: When I left the psionic beam with you, Brigadier, I said it was
only to be used in an emergency. <br>
BRIGADIER: This is an emergency. <br>
DOCTOR: Oil an emergency? Huh! It's about time the people who run this
planet of yours realised that to be dependent upon a mineral slime just
doesn't make sense. Now, the energising of hydrogen <br>
BRIGADIER: Doctor, the destruction of these rigs is a complete mystery.
Do you want more men to die? <br>
DOCTOR: No. Very well. When do we start? <br>
BRIGADIER: The oil company. We're paying them a visit this afternoon. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Huckle takes a file from a cabinet. The Brigadier
is in uniform now.) <br>
HUCKLE: Here's the preliminary medical report on the condition of the
bodies. They died the same way as the others. Exposure and drowning. <br>
HARRY: Yes, so I heard, Mister Huckle. There's quite a few crush
injuries. <br>
HUCKLE: The rig collapsed. <br>
HARRY: I think I'd better take a look at these, sir. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, good idea, Sullivan. You cut off to the sick bay and
we'll see you back at headquarters. <br>
HARRY: Aye, aye, sir. <br>
SARAH: I'll come with you as far as the village. I can talk to some of
the local people, see what I can find out, okay? See you later. <br>
HARRY: Bye, Doctor. <br>
(Harry and Sarah leave. The Doctor has swapped the tam-o'-shanter for
his usual hat, and is staring into space. The Brigadier looks at a
model of an oil rig.) <br>
BRIGADIER: You know, these things always remind me of three legged
spiders in Wellington boots. <br>
HUCKLE: Correction, concrete boots. Thousands of tons of it. Those
babies are meant to be unsinkable. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, so was the Bismarck, and we all know that story. <br>
HUCKLE: We spent a fortune proving the Waverley field geologically
sound. Everything is constantly checked for stability. Winds, tides,
the constant moving of the sea bed. <br>
DOCTOR: You say these radio blackouts have happened before? <br>
HUCKLE: Each time a rig has disappeared. <br>
DOCTOR: And no strange craft in the area? Nothing suspicious? <br>
HUCKLE: Difficult to be sure. It was at night. The radio picked up some
strange sound, but as far as we know, the sea was calm and empty. <br>
DOCTOR: It may be calm, but it's never empty.

McRanald. My family's been in these parts for generations. <br>

besides being the best piper for miles around, you also have second
sight. <br>
McRANALD: Well, I am the seventh son of the seventh son. you know, the
fellow with you, the Doctor, he looks likes a man who might see around
a few corners himself. <br>
SARAH: Quite a few. <br>
(Sarah looks at the stag's head on the wall.) <br>
SARAH: Oh, that's a fine looking head. <br>
McRANALD: Aye. Yon's a twelve pointer. Brought down by the Duke of
Forgill himself. Gave it to the inn just this last week. <br>
SARAH: He's a strange man, this Duke, isn't he? <br>
McRANALD: Would you think so, Miss? You know, I would give it a favour
to remember he is the McRanald, my clan chief. <br>
SARAH: Oh, of course. No, no, it was just that, well, after he picked
us up in his car, he never spoke a word all the way to the village. <br>
McRANALD: Ah well, it's true he's no the Duke I remember. He's been a
different man since the oil companies came. <br>
SARAH: You seem to blame everything on the oil company. <br>
McRANALD: All his servants have left to go and work for them. I've said
Forgill Castle is a cold, empty house these days. Wouldnae care to set
foot in it myself, that's a fact.

clacking in the village, my dear. <br>
SARAH [on monitor]: Is it true? <br>
McRANALD [on monitor]: I'm no saying, but only bad luck comes to them
who set over Tullock Moor. <br>
SARAH [on monitor]: Really? Why? <br>
McRANALD [on monitor]: Tullock Moor's a strange, murky sort of place.
When the mist comes down, it's like steam frae a witch's cauldron.

superstition, surely? <br>
McRANALD: Call it that, if you like. <br>
SARAH: Well, has anything ever happened to anyone up there? <br>
McRANALD: Aye. There was a man, a foreigner from the Black Isle. Stayed
at this very inn. He went out on the moor. Never seen again. <br>
SARAH: Oh, he left without paying his bill, did he? When did this
happen, anyway? <br>
McRANALD: Nineteen hundred and twenty two. Then there was the case of
the Jamieson boys, although that was a wee while ago. <br>
SARAH: Okay. What happened to them? <br>
McRANALD: It was, let me see, 1870. They went out cutting peat and the
mist came down. Donald just disappeared. They found the older brother,
Robert, two days later, wandering about, off his head. His eyes, his
eyes were terrible to see. For the rest of his life he never spoke
again. Take my word for it, my dear. There are ancient mysteries here.
Evil spirits haunt Tullock Moor. <br>
SARAH: Maybe, but I'm certain of one thing, Mister McRanald. Evil
spirits don't destroy oil rigs. </font></p>

down and Harry runs over as the ghillie watches from concealment. It is

you ask me, he's wasting his time. Oh, yes, might as well forget about
security in Tullock. Landlord here's got second sight. <br>

underestimated the power of organic crystallography. Come, it is almost
time for me to leave. <br>
(Once he is alone, the Doctor wakes up.) <br>
DOCTOR: I'm alive! </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Spaceship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FORGILL: Distance? <br>
ZYGON: The Skarasen is fifty Earth miles away, Commander. <br>
FORGILL: Excellent. It is time for me to place the activator on the
target. Humanity is at our feet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The Doctor has gone exploring. He checks the
Duke's pulse then squeezes a couple of controls by his alcove. He wakes
up.) <br>
DUKE: Who are you? <br>
DOCTOR: His Grace the Duke of Forgill, I presume? <br>
DUKE: Yes. Where the blazes am I? <br>
DOCTOR: On a spaceship. <br>
DUKE: Spaceship? <br>
(The Doctor wakes the Caber.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Spaceship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FORGILL: In two minutes, close down dyastetic
transmission and maintain monitor contact. <br>
ZYGON: Understood. Commander. <br>
FORGILL: Open the escape hatch. When phase two is completed, I shall
broadcast my demands to the world. <br>
(With bowler hat and umbrella, the fake Duke walks away from the
spaceship.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (The real Sister Lamont watches the Doctor use his
sonic screwdriver on an alcove control.) <br>
LAMONT: What are you doing? <br>
DOCTOR: We've got to lure the Zygons out of the control room somehow.
This is also a fire sensor. If I can heat it sufficiently <br>
(An alarm sounds.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quick, back into your alcoves! We'll soon see how good their
fire drill is. <br>
(The Doctor hides in another alcove as two Zygons walk through and out
another doorway.) <br>
DOCTOR: (sotto) Okay, quick, everybody out. It won't take them long to
realise it's a false alarm. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Spaceship]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (They run into the control room.) <br>
DOCTOR: Come along, quick. Break that vacuum mechanism to jam the
door.) <br>
CABER: This one? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that one, man. Get on with it. <br>
(Caber rips off a control pseudopod and throws it to the Doctor.) <br>
CABER: Is that broken enough? <br>
DOCTOR: It's more than enough. <br>
(Two Zygons are trapped on the other side of the door.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, let's see what other damage we can do. Anybody know what
this is? <br>
DUKE: I haven't the faintest idea. <br>
LAMONT: You tell us. <br>
DOCTOR: I will. It's a self-destructor, and it works like this. <br>
(The Doctor manipulates lumps on the big orange glowing device.) <br>
DOCTOR: Right, we've got about sixty seconds before the whole ship
blows up. <br>
(The group run into the escape hatch.) <br>
ZYGON [OC]: Open this door! Open this door! </font></p>

Naval uniform.) <br>
SARAH: There it is! <br>
(UNIT run towards the spaceship as the Doctor helps Sister Lamont out,
followed by the Duke and his ghillie.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Everyone get down! <br>
(They all hide behind a bank of sand just as the spaceship goes kaBOOM!
leaving only a twisted superstructure behind.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Well. <br>
DOCTOR: Was that bang big enough for you, Brigadier? <br>
HARRY: Nicely done, Doctor. That's the end of the Zygons, eh? <br>
DOCTOR: Not entirely. Broton escaped and he still has control of the
monster. He plans to attack some target in London. <br>
SARAH: Close to the Thames, huh? <br>
DOCTOR: Exactly. And this time it'll be something really spectacular. <br>
BRIGADIER: I've just remembered. When I spoke to the PM earlier, she
was about to leave for Stanbridge House. And that's on the river. <br>
DOCTOR: What's happening there? <br>
DUKE: The Fourth International Energy Conference. The place'll be full
of VIPs from all over the world. It's a meeting of crucial importance. <br>
DOCTOR: Ah. That could be it, Brigadier. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, but he'd need a pass to get in. The security's very
tight. <br>
SARAH: But he'll have a pass. The Duke, the real Duke, is President of
the Scottish Energy Commission. <br>
DUKE: That's right, I am. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, come on. Let's get to London. </font></p>

and just half a mile up the river from the Palace of Westminster.
Applause can be heard coming from another room as the fake Forgill
looks for somewhere to plant the Skarasen's signalling device.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> BRIGADIER: Three and a half minutes, Doctor, and
still no sign of Broton in the conference hall. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, he was checked into the building. What's behind the
conference hall? <br>
BRIGADIER: Catering section and river terrace. <br>
DOCTOR: You search there. Sarah and I will take the cellar. </font></p>

DOCTOR: Not much light. <br>
SARAH: Maybe somebody should tell the Energy Congress. <br>
DOCTOR: Stay there. <br>
(The Doctor goes down the steps.) <br>
BROTON [OC]: I thought you were dead. <br>
DOCTOR: Loose thinking, Broton. <br>
BROTON [OC]: This time, I shall make certain. <br>
DOCTOR: (to Sarah, sotto) Get the Brigadier. (loud) Broton, your
spaceship's been destroyed. This building is surrounded by soldiers. <br>
(Broton comes out of hiding. Fake Forgill has reverted to his natural
form.) <br>
BROTON: I control the Skarasen! I can destroy this planet or become its
master. That is the choice I offer your world. <br>

stronger than the Time Lord and quickly gets the upper hand.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Morton, through the other door! Right, come with me. <br>
(Morton comes up behind Broton, and gets throttled for his trouble. The
Brigadier and another soldier start shooting. Broton, staggers and
falls against a packing case.) <br>
BROTON: The Skarasen will destroy you all. <br>
(Broton dies.) <br>
SARAH: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: The signal device, quickly. Broton's hidden it in this room
somewhere. Brigadier, evacuate the building. The monster will tear the
place down to get the device. <br>
BRIGADIER: Right. Ferguson, with me. <br>
(The soldiers leave. Harry stays with Sarah and the Doctor.) <br>
DOCTOR: Quiet, both of you. Listen. I can almost feel it. <br>
(The Doctor reaches into his pocket and pulls out the device.) <br>
DOCTOR: The monster must be allowed to destroy it. <br>
(The Doctor runs out of the cellar. Harry checks Morton.) <br>
HARRY: There's nothing I can do for him. <br>
SARAH: And as for this one. <br>

comes face to face with the Skarasen. Elsewhere are police sirens and
people screaming.) <br>

Skarasen follows it.) </font></p>

a country stroll with the real Duke of Forgill.) <br>
DUKE: Tell me, I imagine the whole business caused quite a stir. <br>
BRIGADIER: No, the Cabinet's accepted my report and the whole affair's
now completely closed. <br>
DUKE: You mean it never happened. <br>
BRIGADIER: Well, a fifty foot monster can't swim up the Thames and
attack a large building without some people noticing, but you know what
politicians are like. <br>
DUKE: Yes, quite. By the way, I was coming to meet you people. I could
swear I caught a glimpse of the monster in the Loch. <br>
SARAH: But you're not sure. <br>
DUKE: The sun was in my eyes. Now, where is this contraption of yours? <br>
DOCTOR: My contraption, your Grace, is this way. I think. Follow me.
Come on. <br>
(The party heads up a slope and finds the incongruous police box
waiting for them.) <br>
DUKE: That's the Tardis? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the Tardis. And I'm going to pilot it all the way
to London. I can be there five minutes ago. <br>
SARAH: Just a minute, Doctor. I thought you couldn't do that. <br>
DOCTOR: Of course I can. Coming? <br>
BRIGADIER: No, thank you. <br>
HARRY: I think I'll stick to InterCity this time, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Sarah? <br>
SARAH: Er. <br>
DOCTOR: No? <br>
SARAH: All right. Providing we do go straight back to London. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh yes, we will. I promise. <br>
(Sarah and the Doctor enter the Tardis. It dematerialises.) <br>
DUKE: Well, I'll be. Do they have return tickets? <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, I imagine so. <br>
DUKE: You should have taken them and got your refund, man. I thought
you were a Scotsman. </font> </p>
