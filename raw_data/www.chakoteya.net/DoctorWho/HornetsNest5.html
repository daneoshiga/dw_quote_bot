<td align="left" width="85%"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIKE YATES: (narrating) It's a long time ago now, but I used to find
myself drawn into improbable adventures almost every week as a result
of my working for the same secret military organisation as a particular
man. A mysterious man, who claimed to come from the furthest reaches of
Space. Over three decades later, the fellow turned up again.
Impossibly, it seemed. And I suppose I shouldn't really have been
surprised at some of the more bizarre consequences. It all started in
the third week of December, when I happened upon an intriguing
advertisement in Country Time magazine. Particularly intriguing, as it
seemed to be presenting me, and I presumed me alone, with a direct call
to action. It was so very specific, you see. "Wanted. Retired Army
Captain for light household duties and fireside companionship. Must
tolerate mild eccentricity and strong scientific advice. Knowledge of
giant maggots, super-intelligent spiders and prehistoric monsters a
positive boon." I phoned the number, and talked with the very brusque
housekeeper, known as Mrs Wibbsey, of Nest Cottage in deepest, darkest
Sussex. I reported for duty the very next afternoon. Snow threatening
in the clouds, I remember. The shortest day of the year was still a
recent memory. And when I entered that rather nicely appointed
dwelling, who do you think I should meet again? The Doctor. Large as
life and just as impossible, all over again, looking just as he had
done thirty years previously. Here he was again, an aggravating cross
between Sherlock Holmes and the Mad Hatter. And no sooner had we sat
down to dinner but he had embroiled me in yet another of his outrageous
adventures. True to his very special form, we spent the whole of the
following night in the cellar, barricaded against the ... creatures
that pleased themselves to run amok in his home during the nocturnal
hours. There the Doctor availed himself of the opportunity to fill me
in on some of his recent adventures, all connected with this current ...
predicament. Back in the UNIT days, the Brigadier could never get him
to report fully on anything, not even what he'd taken from the
stationery cupboard. But that night, as we sat there in the dark, he
told me of this extraordinary pursuit he'd been on, chasing deadly
alien hornets through Earth's history. Hornets, I ask you! Still, I
should have known that he'd be involved in something to do with the end
of civilised life on the planet as we know it. The Doctor had erected a
kind of invisible bell-jar over his house, a force-shield, keeping all
the deadly creatures trapped within, along with all the things and
beings they have possessed. Yes, dear listener. The Doctor had trapped
us inside with these terrible creatures. The Doctor's tales were
strange, even for him. Stuffed animals coming to deadly life, the
dancer who stole the haunted ballet shoes, the old doll's house in
which he became trapped. If I hadn't known him well, I'd have sworn he
was making it all up. Then there was the circus where they made him put
his head in the lion's mouth, and the woodlands filled with wild dogs
and besieged nuns. And all the while he had a date with his enemies
here, for the final showdown. Once the Doctor's tales were over, dawn
had arrived and we emerged blinking from the cellar to find Nest
Cottage overrun by the possessed animals. It was a madhouse with Mrs
Wibbsey presiding over it all. Soon, however, as the morning
brightened, the animals fell asleep where they stood as was their wont.
I didn't trust them an inch, however. Just by looking at them you knew
that something very nasty was going on behind their glass eyes. It was
flattering that the Doctor should think that I, his old colleague and
the Brig's second-in-command, could do something to help him defeat
these horrible foes. But I couldn't help wondering why. Little did
either of us realise that it was for the most unimaginably horrible
reason of all.<br>

ANNOUNCER: (Tom Baker) Doctor Who. Hornets' Nest. Hive Of Horror, by
Paul Magrs. Starring Tom Baker and Richard Franklin.<br>
<br>
(Background sounds of clock ticking and coal fire burning.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: (singing) Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of
freedom.<br>
MIKE YATES: Morning, Doctor.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Ah, Mike. Better for a little wash and brush-up, eh?<br>
MIKE YATES: Indeed. Those creatures of yours and that Wibbsey woman can
be a little fierce, I must say. I felt like I was fighting for my life
just getting out of the cellar this morning.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes. It's a good job the dawn had arrived. They're easier
to pacify in the daytime. Tea?<br>
MIKE YATES: Thank you. Now, what are we going to do about these hornet
things? You can't go round hypnotising everything for ever.<br>
THE DOCTOR: First things first, Mike. I have here on the table one or
two pieces of equipment from the TARDIS.<br>
MIKE YATES: You and that Police Box. I wondered why I hadn't seen it
about.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I've hidden it away from the further attentions of the
hornet swarm - she's quite safe. Which is more than I can say for the
entire human race, should the hornets have their way.<br>
MIKE YATES: All right, so what's all this gubbins?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Well, this part is the TARDIS's dimensional stabiliser.<br>
MIKE YATES: Oh.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mm. It's currently generating the force-shield around the
cottage. What are those ballet shoes doing here?<br>
MIKE YATES: I used them to swat that bat last night, remember? Oh, I say.
Are they...?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes they are. The very ones that were controlled by the
group mind of the swarm.<br>
MIKE YATES: Mouldy old things, aren't they?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Bringing them to the table has given me an idea. I do
believe we can use them, in conjunction with all this gubbins as you
call it, to tap into the special powers of the hornets.<br>
MIKE YATES: I see. Just explain to me, what will happen if we don't
defeat these insect things? I need to know what's at stake here.
Soldier, you see.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mike, these hornets are alien creatures that can infiltrate
and possess anything. Human, animal, living, dead, inanimate. They can
bring anything to life.<br>
MIKE YATES: As we've seen with these blasted stuffed animals. Not
exactly world-threatening though, is it?<br>
THE DOCTOR: No? How would you like to have your every move, your every
mood dictated by insects buzzing about inside your skull, mm? They want
to enslave the whole lot of us, and make this world into a nightmarish
place, like the last world they wrecked and abandoned - oh yes, I've
done my research. I know what it means for a world to be attacked by
the deadly swarm.<br>
MIKE YATES: So we're all that stands between Mankind and a horrible
fate at the hands of insects.<br>
THE DOCTOR: They don't have hands, Mike, but yes, you're quite right.
Now, help me to carry this lot back into the parlour, would you?<br>
MIKE YATES: Another one of your lash-ups. It doesn't look very
impressive.<br>
THE DOCTOR: It doesn't have to. The dimensional stabiliser just has be
able to do what I ask it to, tuning itself into the ineffable
vibrations still present in this ballet slipper. Here. Look after the
other one, would you?<br>
MIKE YATES: Ballet slippers indeed!<br>
THE DOCTOR: Our biggest problem, of course, is that in using this
lash-up, I'd be lowering the defensive shield around the cottage. The
stabiliser can't do both jobs at once, you see.<br>
MIKE YATES: Isn't that terribly dangerous?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Potentially lethal, not just to us but to the entire
planet, but I can't see any way around it. While I'm using this machine
the force-shield will crumble, and everything that's kept safely
indoors will be able to get out. All the stuffed animals, the
bric-a-brac, the possessed furniture, even Captain the wolfhound. The
hornets will be able to take over again.<br>
MIKE YATES: And what is it this machine'll be doing?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Just wait and see. If it works, it will be marvellous. But
the clock will be ticking. We will have a mission and a very finite
time in which to accomplish that mission. Otherwise all, and I mean
all, is lost.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) The Doctor then had me carry all the various
bits of his machine through the hallway and into the parlour of his
cottage. A rather musty-smelling disused room at the back. There, on a
pristine Persian rug, stood a zebra - stuffed, and luckily, quite
inanimate.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Ah good, she's asleep. I thought we'd have to chase her
around and force her down, but she's deeply under, thank goodness.<br>
MIKE YATES: Is it particularly dangerous then, this zebra?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Close the door behind us, quickly man.<br>
(Door closed.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: She's the deadliest of the lot. She's the only one I can't
always pacify through hypnosis.<br>
MIKE YATES: Beautiful beast. And why is that? You can put all the
others in a trance pretty easily, can't you?<br>
THE DOCTOR: It's keeping them there. That's the hard thing, but this
zebra, I can't put her under at all. She paces around in here all
night. She'd have your arm off if she could get hold of you. There's
something singular about this zebra, something different to the others.<br>
MIKE YATES: You said something about taking our struggle to the top, to
the lion's den.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Well, not the lion exactly. Zebra.<br>
MIKE YATES: Are you saying this creature contains the leader of the
hornets?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Very good, Mike, very good indeed. Now, just let me get
this machine sorted.<br>
MIKE YATES: Good gracious. The Queen of the swarm, inside a zebra.<br>
(Knocking on wooden door.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes.<br>
(Door opens, MRS WIBBSEY clears her throat.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Are you and your friend in for lunch today, Doctor?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, come in and close the door behind you.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Whatever are you doing with that zebra?<br>
THE DOCTOR: The door, Mike!<br>
(Door closed.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, Mike, we are going to confront the Queen in
her hive, where she is defended and protected at the very heart of the
swarm. Probably she is aware of us at this very moment. As tiny as she
is, she's watching us, amused by our antics.<br>
MIKE YATES: How do we get at her?<br>
THE DOCTOR: We're on our way. Can't you feel it?<br>
(Wind whistling noise.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: The dimensional stabiliser's working. Now, everybody hold
onto the zebra's head, and onto each other.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Ooh...<br>
MIKE YATES: Now that you mention it, I ... do feel rather queasy.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Get your hands off. I'm not coming anywhere with you. I've
work to be doing.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh, Mrs Wibbsey, too late.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Ooh!<br>
THE DOCTOR: We couldn't possibly risk leaving you behind. Now, hold on.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What's happening? The room's getting bigger.<br>
MIKE YATES: No. We're getting smaller. Aren't we, Doctor?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Oh...<br>
MIKE YATES: That's what you're doing. You're shrinking us down.<br>
THE DOCTOR: To the size of a match-head. You're right, Mike. We're
going to face the hornets on their own level, inside their very own
nest. We are going into the hive itself.<br>
(MRS WIBBSEY fearful gasp. THE DOCTOR laughs.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: The ground's falling away from my feet!<br>
THE DOCTOR: Pull yourself together, Wibbsey.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) This is where things started going really
peculiar - at least as far as I was concerned. The Doctor had been
battling the hornets for some weeks, and he'd been through some pretty
rum dos. All I had done was listen to his stories. Now, at last, I felt
that I was getting properly involved.<br>
<br>
(Shrinking noise subsides.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What are you doing to us, you foolish man?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Remember, Mrs Wibbsey, how you were instrumental in
shrinking Ernestina and me and popping us into that antique doll's
house?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: You can't blame me for that. I wasn't in my right mind.<br>
THE DOCTOR: It's very fascinating - being shrunk, I mean. Think of it
as a learning experience.<br>
MIKE YATES: Have we stopped?<br>
(Shrinking noise stops.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: I hope so. We couldn't get much smaller.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh, we could keep on shrinking forever. We could be right
down in the microverse if we're not careful. There are galaxies within
galaxies, you know.<br>
MIKE YATES: Doctor, don't alarm the poor woman.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: I've heard worse from him.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Anyway, I've gauged everything correctly. I think we've
stopped.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) We were standing on a kind of steep hillside
covered in long, coarse grass. For a moment or two it was perplexing
... until the Doctor pointed out that the vegetation was black and
white.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: This isn't long grass. It's fur.<br>
MIKE YATES: The zebra?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Would a zebra describe it as fur, do you think? Or pelt.
Certainly not hair. Anyway, we appear to be on the zebra's head.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) It was one of the most curious expeditions I
have ever been involved with. We had to clamber our way down to the
ear, tethered together by the Doctor's scarf. Suddenly I could see the
sense of his wearing such a ludicrous item of apparel. Mrs Wibbsey was
complaining all the way, and I pointed out that I hadn't expected a
civilian to be tagging along with us.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Civilian? Typical soldier's talk. Look at you, like two
little boys going off on an adventure.<br>
MIKE YATES: Hardly boys, Mrs Wibbsey.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: You should know better at your ages.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Here we are, outside the gateway to the brain.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: How can it have a brain? It's stuffed.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Not a brain like you or I understand it. It's a hornets'
nest in there, the central headquarters of our enemies.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Oh, I see. And you're going in there, are you?<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) I studied her reaction for a moment or two. I
was highly suspicious when it came to Mrs Wibbsey. The Doctor had told
me of her strange carryings-on, back in her own time in the Palace of
Curios. She had already been taken over by the hornets. Perhaps she was
still susceptible to their control. It's something I know quite a lot
about. Perhaps Mrs Wibbsey was here to keep an eye on us. I listened
hard, but I couldn't detect that curious buzzing noise the Doctor said
could be heard around the persons of the possessed. Perhaps that was
because I had become deaf to the humming of the insects. We were so
small, no bigger than the head of a pin, and the hornet noise was all
about us.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Well, Mrs Wibbsey? Are you coming with us?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: That ear-hole looks awfully dark.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Luckily, I've brought my torch. Come on.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) The ground underfoot was curiously hollow. Each
footstep made a thumping noise as we clattered our way into the ear.
The preserved skin of the beast felt a bit like hairy cardboard, and it
was rank with layers of dust. After a good deal of awkward clambering
and panting and sneezing, we were inside the dark cavity that led
straight into the stuffed beast's head.<br>
<br>
(Gentle whistling of wind in background.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: We haven't time to rest for long. This place will be on the
alert. They'll know we're here pretty soon.<br>
MIKE YATES: Just give me a moment.<br>
THE DOCTOR: All right, Mike.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Look at him. He can hardly breathe. What are you thinking
of, Doctor, bringing him into this? What can he do?<br>
MIKE YATES: I'm just a little out of training, that's all.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: These hornets are ruthless, deadly. What on Earth do you
hope to do about them?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, enough.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What? I just don't see what's so special about him. He's a
has-been.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Sometimes you forget yourself, Mrs Wibbsey.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: On the contrary, I remember everything.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) And with that, the aggravating housekeeper
turned to lead us into the darkness and up inside the inner ear.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: Better keep an eye on her, Doctor.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Quite. Did I ever tell you, Mike, about the time I was
shrunk and injected into my own head? Phoar! This trip is a doddle
compared to that one.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) And so we walked through constricted tunnels on
the toughened corrugations of dried canals. The Doctor's torch beam
played ahead of us, illuminating dead blood vessels that looked like
graffiti on the walls. The reek of formaldehyde was heavy on the air,
almost drugging us as we trudged into the weird darkness.<br>
(Multiple insects buzzing.)<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) And now we could hear it - the song of the
hornets. We were approaching their nest.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: I must say, I find it most odd they haven't sent anyone to
attack us.<br>
MIKE YATES: We should have brought more weapons.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Perhaps they want us to get inside. Perhaps we are
unimpeded for a reason.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, I believe you may be right.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) Soon the ground underfoot was different, paler,
soft like vellum. The Doctor crouched in the darkness, tapping and
touching this new surface.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: It's paper. We're very near.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Paper? The mind is made out of paper?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Of course. The hornets chew it into a pulp, then they form
these fantastic cities of whirled tunnels and luminous chambers and
cells. They are engineering masterpieces, cities of papier-mâché.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) I brought up the rear as we advanced into the
city's brain, or rather the brain city. It grew lighter, almost
imperceptibly, and we let go of the Doctor's scarf. He looped it back
around his neck and sniffed the air like a dog, catching his bearings
from the breeze. As the paper tunnels twisted and veered, we lost all
sense of direction. Pale golden light threw soft shadows everywhere,
and we plodded cautiously in their smudginess, deeper into the paper
labyrinth. Mrs Wibbsey saw my hip flask, and scowled.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: I thought you didn't drink these days, Mike.<br>
MIKE YATES: I don't. Lethbridge-Stewart gave me this the day I left the
service. It's still got some of his whisky in it. Sentimental of me to
carry it, but I do. I just suddenly had an idea about it.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Never mind that now. Evil stuff. Put it away.<br>
THE DOCTOR: We mustn't get distracted, Mike.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: We're lost, aren't we?<br>
THE DOCTOR: All paths will tend towards the heart and the Queen in the
centre of her hive. We'll get there.<br>
MIKE YATES: What I don't understand is, why haven't we seen any of the
hornet creatures? For a central headquarters, this place isn't very
busy.<br>
THE DOCTOR: They've all been out in the fields as it were, Mike,
running amok through the countryside in their possessed body vehicles,
gathering food for the Queen, from the base mental energy I told you
about earlier. All those encounters I told you about through history,
they were with warrior hornets, the soldiers, the drones, all serving
the Queen. I have a feeling though, now that we're in here, they may
soon be making a return to the nest.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) Little did we know that even as we spoke, the
hornets were emerging from their hiding-places in Nest Cottage. Out
they came from the stuffed creatures, scuttling from inside the
furniture and out of the woodwork. The air must have been thick and
black with their teeming bodies as they made their way to the zebra
host.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: Shh! Can you hear them?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: I think so.<br>
MIKE YATES: I can't. It's too quiet if you ask me.<br>
THE DOCTOR: They're playing with us, taunting us.<br>
MIKE YATES: But they're only insects. Why should we submit to their
mind games? We should be able to just ... smoke them out. Had bees in
my chimney breast once, you know. That's how you get shot of them, with
smoke, pure and simple.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Hornets are very subtle, Mr Yates. They stole inside my
mind all those years ago. I couldn't think straight. They turned my
whole world upside-down. Their song distorts everything.<br>
MIKE YATES: Fortunately I've spent many years learning to withstand
brainwashing techniques, training myself, honing my defences. Following
my ... breakdown, I studied with a number of Yogis and mystics. Nothing
can interfere with <i> my </i> mind.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: You wouldn't be able to resist them any more than I could.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Come on. The vibrations in the walls are becoming deeper,
more profound. We are near the centre.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Doctor, what are you going to do once you're face-to-face
with this Queen in her hive? Bamboozle her? Charm her with that wit and
debonair style you keep telling me about?<br>
THE DOCTOR: That would be a start, wouldn't it?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: You don't appreciate their power, their might.<br>
MIKE YATES: Rot. No good will come of defeatist talk, Mrs Wibbsey.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: With respect, Mr Yates, you're no longer anyone's knight
in shining armour, are you? And this one's brains are addled the way
he's talking. He's been affected by his battles with these creatures.
All I'm saying is that we don't stand a chance.<br>
MIKE YATES: I've a good mind to send you back the way you came.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Where? Nineteen Thirty-Two, mm? I can't go back there, can
I? I've been taken out of my time. My life is ruined. I'm in the
future, way after whenever my natural death would have been. What have
I got left?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Not even the Palace of Curios. I'm sorry, Mrs Wibbsey, but
taking you away from there, it was the only way. Everything infected
and infested. I had to get it back to my cottage.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: I'm just the same as that dead gargoyle man in the garden,
or your dog. I'm just another infested thing.<br>
THE DOCTOR: 'Fraid so, Wibbsey.<br>
MIKE YATES: She's still under their control.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What?<br>
MIKE YATES: It's just hit me, the way she's talking, jeering at us,
bringing down our morale. It's the hornets, talking through her.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: The man's mad.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, are you sure? Are you under their power again?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: No. I'd be the first to know, wouldn't I?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Not necessarily.<br>
MIKE YATES: It's her. She's the Queen of the hive.<br>
THE DOCTOR: What?<br>
MIKE YATES: I could tell she was up to something. She's been laughing
at us the whole time.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What are you doing? Get your hands off me!<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mike, what are you doing?<br>
MIKE YATES: I'm arresting her.<br>
THE DOCTOR: With your necktie?<br>
MIKE YATES: It'll keep her out of mischief while we're in here, to have
her hands tied.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Now I can't even defend myself if we're attacked.<br>
MIKE YATES: You're the hornet Queen. They won't attack you.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: You're talking rubbish. I'm just a woman. Just a stupid
old woman who believed the Doctor when he promised her she'd come to no
more harm if she followed him. Well, that was wrong for a start.<br>
THE DOCTOR: You haven't been repossessed, have you, Mrs Wibbsey?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Of course not.<br>
THE DOCTOR: It must be hard to tell, when everything is so distorted.
It would be very disappointing to learn that you have been the hornet
Queen all this time. I would feel very let down.<br>
MIKE YATES: It seems there are some people who simply can't be
rehabilitated.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I hope you're not becoming callous and flippant in your
maturer years, Mike.<br>
MIKE YATES: Nonsense, Doctor. Now, come on. We'd best get moving again.
I feel better now that we've got this one under some measure of control.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) I was being such an idiot. I don't know what
had come over me. It really wasn't like me to be ... yes, as the Doctor
said, callous and flippant. But I had slipped into some awful mood.
Something was niggling at me, and making me behave like this. We turned
the next corner, and there they were waiting for us. A small party of
hornet drones, hovering malevolently and blocking the whole tunnel
ahead of us. Even in my mood of dark bravado they came as a shock. Each
was as large as a bicycle and they pedalled in mid air, gazing down on
us with glittering black eyes. Their wings were a jewel-like blur,
their stings were arched forward, sheeny tips, curdled with venom. They
had come to collect us. That much was clear.<br>
<br>
(Buzzing of many insects.)<br>
THE DOCTOR: How very nice to see you at last. We were thinking that
perhaps we'd come to the party too late, that this was an empty hive.
Is the Queen in residence then today? I saw no flags.<br>
MIKE YATES: Not very communicative, are they?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: They're turning. We have to follow them.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, keep out of range of their stings.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Why should I care? We're dead now anyway, aren't we? Look,
untie me, will you?<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) As we were led into the depths of their hive,
it was clear that the whole place was filling up again. The insects had
come crawling out of the cottage wainscotting, and they were coming
home to welcome us. We were being drawn into the deadliest of traps.
The Doctor told me later that at this point he began to notice
something very strange about me. According to him, my behaviour since
we had entered the hive had become more and more erratic. For instance,
tying up Mrs Wibbsey, which the Doctor said was typical of some new
snappish paranoid demeanour I had taken on. He had seen me like this
before, in my dark days, when I turned traitor against my friends,
before my breakdown. As we entered into the throne room of the Queen of
the hive, he could see that my hand was ready to go for my automatic
pistol. Not that it would have done me any good in there. The insects
would have been upon me before I could cause much damage. But the
Doctor could see I was as itchy and as jumpy as the hornets were, and
that wasn't good news for any of us. He recounted to me later how the
rest of that final encounter in the skull had unfurled.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: The Queen was prying into our thoughts, Mike. I could sense
her exquisite feelers tickling at the edges of my consciousness. She
was tasting my mind, and rubbing her coarsely-haired legs against her
mandibles with greedy avarice. She was outraged at one level that
creatures of this world had the temerity to seek audience with her in
her own home. But at another level, she was delighted - this was new,
this was sensational, nothing like this had ever happened before. The
Queen waited, drooling on her throne. We were marched into her golden
state room, and marvelled at the architecture. Do you remember, Mike?
Stuck with insect spit, moulded lovingly by a million twitchy legs. The
throne room was a miracle, furnished in sputum, venom and pulp. Yes,
sputum, venom and pulp. I got my bearings, and surveyed the scene. And
there she was. A more delectable specimen of vespida I have never seen.
Her vast bald head nodded and swayed as she stared back at us. Her
livery was buttercup yellow and brilliant black. She buzzed and
quivered with massive intelligence, and we could feel the telepathic
waves emanating from her. Hot, like a hairdryer on full blast. We could
feel the musings and mitherings of millions upon millions of her
workers and drones feeding back to her.<br>
<br>
(<i>This is where part one ended on the radio</i>.)<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: It's her. It's really her!<br>MIKE YATES: This creature is what has caused mayhem down all these years? It's horrible.<br>THE DOCTOR: Horrible? I don't think so, Mike. I think she's rather beautiful, so tremulously alert. <br>MIKE YATES: Don't get too close.<br>THE
DOCTOR: I don't think she'll lash out and kill me now. Not after all
this time, mm? We've known each other a very long time, haven't we,
dear?
How long is it since you came to Earth, twelve hundred years? And I've
known you almost as long, one way or another. And you know me well,
too, don't you, even if we've been advancing towards each other from
opposite ends of time.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: Stop chuntering. Do something. Kill her!<br>MIKE
YATES: Oh, do be quiet, woman. The Doctor knows what he's doing. And
watch you don't disturb the drones. Step out of line and they'll have
you.<br>THE DOCTOR: We've been doing the two-step across the centuries,
haven't we, your Majesty, bowing and whirling about each other. I've
been dancing the gentleman's excuse me, tapping the shoulders of each
human being you have possessed, freeing them, and chasing after your
next victim, and I've been defeating you, haven't I, eh? Each time
finding out where you're skulking, what shady corners your swarm is
hiding in, what ancient pieces of bric-a-brac you're making your home.
Ha, ha. Hardly an impressive invasion, is it. Hardly an invasion at all.<br>MIKE YATES: I've seen him do this before. He's goading her.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: So you still think he knows what he's doing, Mr Yates? He's a madman!<br>MIKE YATES: He gets quite close to the edge sometimes, but don't we all, in facing the things we fear?<br>THE
DOCTOR: Come on, what have you got to say for yourself, eh? All this
time, twelve hundred years, it's a very long time to have somebody's
acquaintance and never really meet them face to face. Aren't you
terribly curious to see how I'm getting on, hmm?<br>THE QUEEN: Where are our manners. Of course. We do apologise, Doctor. You must forgive us.<br>THE DOCTOR: That's more like it, your Majesty. I thought you were sulking.<br>THE
QUEEN: You must understand, our attention is on so many things at once.
Such a huge empire. So many minds linked to ours. It can be quite hard.<br>THE
DOCTOR: What, to focus on what's right underneath your very probosis?
Yes, I can see that. Well, it's us. Here we are. We've come straight to
your heart of operations this time. I was sick of dashing about the
place taking care of the damage you caused. I've come straight to the
lady at the top.<br>THE QUEEN: (chuckles) How very kind.<br><br>(<i>This is where part two started on the radio</i>.)<br><br>THE QUEEN: We are most gratified and pleased to see you in the puny
ephemeral flesh, Doctor.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Eh? Puny and ephemeral it may be, but it's also very
determined. That goes for all three of us. My housekeeper, Mrs Wibbsey,
whom you already met and possessed of course, and the former Captain
Mike Yates over there. You should know him - he's a devil when his
dander's up, aren't ya, Mike?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Doctor, something's wrong with Mr Yates.<br>THE DOCTOR: Mike?<br>THE QUEEN: Come here, little man. Come and kneel before your Queen.<br>MIKE YATES: Your Majesty.<br>THE QUEEN: Queen and Country. Aren't you supposed to serve your Queen and Country?<br>THE DOCTOR: Not hornet Queen and Country, that's not it. Mike, come back.<br>THE
QUEEN: Did your Queen ever knight you, Captain Yates? Did she ever
reward you properly for your years of steadfast service? For facing the
foes you did, for saving the world again and again. <br>MIKE YATES: No, as a matter of fact, she didn't.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: He's getting very close to her, Doctor.<br>THE DOCTOR: Mike, come back. You don't care about medals and titles and all that rubbish. <br>THE
QUEEN: You didn't even get an honourable discharge. Why, you were only
trying to make the world a better place, weren't you? A new, more
enlightened regime. And yet they cast you out. They forgot about you,
didn't they, Captain Yates. We will reward you. We will make you our
knight. Come here, little man.<br>THE DOCTOR: Mike, be careful. <br>MIKE YATES: I know what I'm doing.<br><br>THE
DOCTOR: And there you were, Mike, having advanced on bended knee before
the Queen. She was basking in your supplication, preeningly glad of
your cringing before her mandibles. But then, at the very last moment,
you whipped out your service revolver.<br><br>THE QUEEN: And what is this supposed to be? Some kind of attempt on our life? <br>MIKE YATES: I can put a whole clip of bullets through your brain before your next breath. Where would the hornets be then, eh?<br>THE QUEEN: &nbsp;Interesting. I thought we had succeeded in controlling you. <br>MIKE YATES: I've resisted stronger forces than you.<br>THE DOCTOR: Well done, Mike, but, er, I wouldn't kill her though, not just yet. <br>MIKE
YATES: If I do, that's an end to it. The Queen rules all, doesn't she?
Without her, the rest are just a harmless bunch of insects, aren't they.<br>THE DOCTOR: To an extent, they are, but we'd never get out of here alive if you assassinated her now.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: The fool's going to get us killed, isn't he?<br>THE
DOCTOR: There are better ways of going about this, Mike. You don't need
to go waving guns around. This is an intelligent species.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: Stupid soldier games he's playing. You think he'll listen to you?<br>MIKE YATES: Point blank range.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: Half an hour ago, that's what he was going to do to me. The man's a menace.<br>THE
QUEEN: No one is going to die. You are all precious to us. You are all
here because we have called you here. You each have a role.<br>MIKE YATES: Stop talking, all of you.<br>THE DOCTOR: Mike, back away from her.<br>MIKE YATES: No, Doctor. <br>THE DOCTOR: If you harm him ...<br>THE QUEEN: Who is the most threatened? Are we in a position to hurt him? We think not.<br>THE DOCTOR: You're reaching into his mind.<br>MIKE YATES: I must kill you. Queen and Country.<br>THE
QUEEN: Such a loyal little man. No wonder you think so much of him,
Doctor. Your friendship has gone on for years, rather like ours.<br>THE
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. How do we even know you're a Queen? I've never
met you before. I've felt your presence, yes, in each and every time
I've met your kind.<br>THE QUEEN: What are you talking about.<br>MIKE YATES: Of course she's a Queen.<br>THE
DOCTOR: But I've only ever fought your minions, your workers, your
drones. They've been doing all the dirty work, such as possessing poor
old Mrs Wibbsey here, or running that dreadful circus of doom. But you,
you've kept yourself hidden away, haven't you. I glimpsed you once,
dancing in a pig's eye, the precious one, the fragile Queen. Where was
your nest then, in all those previous encounters, eh? Where was the
hive?<br>THE QUEEN: The hive is always hidden. Workers and drones
protect it. You have never met us before in the flesh because there was
no need. But we have felt each other's influence, haven't we, Doctor?
We have both known the other was there.<br>THE DOCTOR: Sort of. But if
my friend is going to shoot someone, I'd rather know for certain that
he was wasting all of his bullets on the <i>actual</i> Queen, you see.<br>THE QUEEN: Of course we are the Queen! <br>MIKE YATES: Shall I kill her? Would it be over if I did?<br>THE DOCTOR: Almost as over as you can get, Mike. No, leave her alone. I want to reason with the woman.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: I've had them in my mind. They're ruthless, alien, heartless. You can't talk to them as if they're people.<br>THE DOCTOR: I hope I talk to everyone as if they're people, Mrs Wibbsey, alien or not.<br>THE QUEEN: You are also so interesting. But we're weary now. We need to replenish our strength. <br><br>THE
DOCTOR: (narrating) She motioned once, jerkily, with a single arm, and
the throne room was filled at once with workers. They danced attendance
on her effortlessly, and we saw hoe futile any gesture of rebellion on
our part was. You could never have attacked her, Mike. The way those
creatures moved, some would have interposed themselves to take the
bullets. The Queen was never in danger. She was toying with us,
learning about us. You looked very dejected as you sat there at her
feet, the air about you whirring with hornet activity. The workers were
bringing their Queen great fleshy pillows, containing some gloopy
substance. She was taking each sac, puncturing it, and drinking the
golden ichor down greedily. It was evidently tea time for the Queen.
What was she eating if it wasn't bread and honey? I racked my brains.
Wasn't it something that the pupating young in their cells manufactured, some
kind of life-sustaining jelly that they secreted and gave soley to the
Queen in her hive? I watched with fascination. <br><br>THE DOCTOR: Even in deadliest danger there's something to be learned, Mrs Wibbsey. Just look at that.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: You men make me sick. Can't you see we're going to die?<br>THE
DOCTOR: And you, Mrs Wibbsey, are teetering at the edge of being an
impossible companion. Remember? Negative thoughts are what they love.
They feed on them psychically. They <i>want</i> us to think nasty
things. Did you see the Queen writhe as Mike held his gun at her and
thought murderous things about her? It's all bread and butter to her.
Bread and butter for her golden jelly.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: What are they doing?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Leading us away. The Queen evidently wants some privacy.
Well, we can't deny a lady her afternoon nap.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: But Captain Yates?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Shh. She's separating us. That doesn't bode well, does it?
Be strong, Mike. Don't give in.<br>
MIKE YATES: Doctor? What? Where are you going?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) We had no choice, Mike, but to leave you there.
The hornets descended, stings brandished cruelly at our backs. We were
taken out of the throne room and through a complex network of luminous
corridors. Then we were bundled into a waxy cell. The walls were almost
transparent. Through them, we could see the vague shifting bodies of
the hornets going about their business.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: We're sealed in. Do they eat humans?<br>
THE DOCTOR: No, of course not.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: You don't know everything.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Very true.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Well, what do they want us for?<br>
THE DOCTOR: We've been taken over before - well, you have. They
couldn't properly get to me, too well-balanced and sweet-natured as I
am.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What?<br>
THE DOCTOR: It may be easier for them to control damaged souls, people
who rage inside their hearts. Those who think dark thoughts of jealousy
and pain. Those people are susceptible. You know that, Mrs Wibbsey.
That's what allows the hornets to peep inside your mind. They want to
control people like that and pilot them, use them. Take over the world
with them.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Take over the world?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes. How does that make you feel, Mrs Wibbsey? Promotion at
last, eh?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: It sounds better than running around after an
intergalactic dilettante and cleaning up his messes.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh - does it really? I am appalled by that.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Oh ... I shouldn't lash out at you. You've been very good
to me. Especially after I almost had you killed that time.<br>
THE DOCTOR: It's the hornets. They've had us all acting counter to our
natures.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Is it true, what you said? That they're drawn to damaged,
embittered hearts, that they feed off negative human emotions?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh yes. The psychic vibrations are so much more delectable,
it seems, from a person in distress. Luckily, I'm quite a cheery soul
deep down. That's why no matter what they tried, they could never
subsume my personality ultimately. I'm quite well-balanced, you'll be startled to hear.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: As I'm a bitter old woman. <br>THE DOCTOR: Ye - oh, now, now. <br>MRS
WIBBSEY: No, it's true. Even back in Cromer, when my tiny life revolved
around the Palace of Curios, I couldn't be content even then, even when
I wasn't in constant deadly danger. <br>THE DOCTOR: Perhaps you need new challenges.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: Adventures, you mean? I'm not sure I hold with adventures if that's what we're having now.<br>THE DOCTOR: It's not always like this, you know. Sometimes the things I get involved in can be absolutely hair-raising. But it's Mike I'm worried about.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: She's turning him against us.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes. But I believe he's strong.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What about the darkness in his soul, Doctor? Are you sure
he isn't easy prey for them like I was? You don't really know what's
inside him, do you, what resentments he harbours, what dreadful
thoughts?<br>
THE DOCTOR: He won't betray me. I've known him since he was a young
man. He's had a few wobbles, a few unfortunate allegiances, but I trust
him nevertheless.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) But just at that very moment, I was in
consultation with the jubilant Queen of the hive. She was murmuring
sweet dark nothings into these old soldier's ears of mine. I'll admit I
was confused, but trying to remain implacable in the face of her
blandishments. She buzzed away in my ears. What she said went beyond
words. It was a deep, deadly buzzing through the fibres of my mind. A
low, hypnotic beat that rang through my consciousness. The vibrations
entered into me, and stirred the murky resentments at the bottom of my
soul.<br>
<br>
THE QUEEN: You don't know anything about this man from Space. You never
did. And yet he has had more impact on your life and career than almost
anyone.<br>
MIKE YATES: I trust the Doctor.<br>
THE QUEEN: But he has made a fool of you, all these years. He turns up,
and does as he pleases. He takes all the credit. He deplores your
contributions and methods. He secretly laughs at your pathetic
limitations, your susceptibilities. Artificial intelligence is taking
over your every waking thought. All those evil people at Operation
Golden Age and their wicked blandishments. The Doctor despairs of you,
and your idiocy.<br>
MIKE YATES: No! You're lying. He's been a good friend.<br>
THE QUEEN: You don't even know who he is. You humans can't rely on him.
One day he will stop turning up. You'll be left to face the dangers
alone, and he won't care.<br>
MIKE YATES: He ... he has other obligations. Cosmic ones.<br>
THE QUEEN: Are you sure? Are you sure he really travels in Space, like
he says he does, in that ridiculous box of his? What proof do you have?
Here you find him living in just an ordinary house. But what if it were
all lies, Mike? What if he had taken you in?<br>
MIKE YATES: I'm not listening to this.<br>
THE QUEEN: You're old now. Look at him. Young again. He'll be young for
ever. He can renew himself whenever he likes. He will turn up in a new
body ever younger just when you thought you have seen the back of him.
Isn't that just rubbing your face in it? His freedom from the ravages
of Time, compared with your inevitable decrepitude?<br>
MIKE YATES: It might have escaped your notice, but ... he's a Time
Lord. I - I'm just a soldier. Just a human being.<br>
THE QUEEN: But ... what if someone were in a position to offer you
possession of the Doctor's body? You could have his mind, his powers,
his endlessly renewable form. What then, Captain Yates?<br>
MIKE YATES: You can't do that. Can you?<br>
THE QUEEN: (laughs) We can get inside people's minds. We can twist
them, turn them, swap them about. Your minds are just little vessels to
us, like molten glass.<br>
MIKE YATES: Even the Doctor's?<br>
THE QUEEN: He thinks he is impervious to us. But when we were in his
TARDIS, when we were playing inside his mind ... Oh, then he was so
scared. He saw that he isn't so immune to us. The mind of the hive can
go anywhere, do anything. Yes, Mike, we can take you into his mind. We
can gift it to you, if you do things for us.<br>
MIKE YATES: Things?<br>
THE QUEEN: The little matter of your world. You have through your past
knowledge and connections access to the minds in control of this world.
The key figures who hold the real power. You can use the high rank of
those people you still know in the military to help us infiltrate. You
can take us straight to them, and then we can really spread our wings
and swarm in earnest.<br>
MIKE YATES: That's all you want, is it? A chance to take over the world?<br>
THE QUEEN: And improve it. You feel better, don't you, for accepting
our influence inside your mind? You are invigorated, aren't you?<br>
MIKE YATES: It's true. I am. I really am. Just like before. So you are
offering me a chance to...<br>
THE QUEEN: To become the Doctor. To revel in his freedom from
obligation, to do exactly what you want for as long as you want. We are
giving you forever, should you want it.<br>
MIKE YATES: Preposterous.<br>
THE QUEEN: (laugh) But very, very true.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) If I could have overheard any of that at the
time, Mike, I would have been even more worried. It must have sounded
rather as if you had given in to her cajoling. And who could blame you?
Who <i> wouldn't</i> want to be me? Still in all, it's a
pretty dirty trick setting friend against friend. Meanwhile, back in
our cell...<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: I wish I was religious. I could be praying now. But I
never really felt the need. Never saw what they saw in it, if you see
what I mean. My mother was at church three times on a Sunday, but she
liked the singing and&nbsp;trips out.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, snap out of it. We need to break out of here
at once.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What? Why? What's the point?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Because at last, I've had an idea. I've put two and two
together, and I've come up with this.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What is it?<br>
THE DOCTOR: A ballet slipper.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Looks more like a bag of aniseed balls to me.<br>
THE DOCTOR: You're right. I could have sworn I had Ernestina's ballet
slipper in my pocket.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Oh, those blessed slippers.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Ah! I gave it to Mike for safe keeping. I knew it would
come in handy. We have to get it from him, right now.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: What are you going to do with a manky old...<br>
THE DOCTOR: No time for questions. Look at the walls of this cell. What
are they made of?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: No time for questions, he says. These walls, what are
they...? God knows.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Papier-mâché, which burns. What's this?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: It's a box of safety matches.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Exactly.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) You see, Mike, I just wanted to burn enough to
get us out of our cell, and to put the wind up the hornets. I was
resorting to desperate measures, I know. Setting light to things in the
brain was an insanely dangerous means to an end. The black smoke was
impressive, gushing in billows down the narrow capillaries of the
hornet city. The insects panicked and backed away, leaving the way
relatively clear for Mrs Wibbsey and myself to clamber out of the cell
and to find ourselves at large in the nest.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Oh, what on earth are you going to do with a ballet
slipper, provided you can even get to it?<br>
THE DOCTOR: It's still live.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Alive?<br>
THE DOCTOR: No, live, live, from its contact with the hive mind. You
used it yourself when you were under their control. I foolishly thought
it was free of the insects once I left Cromer, but I was wrong. They
still possess both Ernestina and her stolen slippers.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: How did you ever think you could defeat them? It's like
fighting the swarm with a butterfly net. They'll always elude you and
do further damage.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I think I know of a way to use the slipper. It's very
chancy, but it just might work, if I line up my ducks correctly. <br>MRS WIBBSEY: Your ducks?<br>THE DOCTOR: It's a figure of speech, Mrs Wibbsey.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: I never know with you. If a whole line of ducks came walking in now, I don't think I'd bat an eyelid.<br>THE DOCTOR: Oh, do you know, I think I'm rather flattered by that. Mrs Wibbsey, I believe that was almost a compliment.<br>
(Buzzing of insects.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Doctor! Watch out.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) The attacking hornets weren't impressed by the
burning torch I brandished their way, but they were absurdly fearful of
the acrid churning smoke. Our luck was holding out. Of all the
branching tunnels, we opted for the best-guarded ones, knowing that
they would lead back to the centre of the nest.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: She just wanted us out of the way so she could concentrate
on Captain Yates.<br>
THE DOCTOR: I'm a bit put out by that. Here was I assuming that all of
this was to do with me, but she was after Mike the whole time. She must
have maneuvered me into inviting him. I must have placed that
advertisement under the hornets' guidance.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: I suppose he'll have a lot of connections, that one. Handy
when it comes to taking over the world.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh, indeed. I'm not too shabby in that department myself,
you know, but I'm no name-dropper of course.<br>
(Buzzing of insects.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Here, look out. Here they come again.<br>
MIKE YATES: Doctor? Doctor? I'm here.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mike?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Just be careful. He's got a funny look about him.<br>
THE DOCTOR: He won't have given in to her, Mrs Wibbsey. I know my Mike.<br>
MIKE YATES: Stop fighting them, Doctor. Put out that flame.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Not just yet, Mike.<br>
MIKE YATES: You'll never believe what she offered me.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Try me.<br>
MIKE YATES: If I betrayed my world, the whole world, that's all she
wanted. She was pretty forward with her demands.<br>
THE DOCTOR: What did she offer you, Captain Yates?<br>
MIKE YATES: You, Doctor. She said she could make me become you.<br>
THE DOCTOR: What?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: See? The man's completely doolally.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Shh, shh. Listen Mike, you must realise that whatever she
says, it's impossible. It's madness.<br>
MIKE YATES: They seem to do a pretty good job of tampering with minds.
Even Time Lord minds.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Your attitude at that moment, Mike, your whole
demeanour, I found very perplexing. You sounded so reasonable, so
unthreatening. But beneath your calm words I detected a steely will, a
will not your own. I felt in that instant as thought the mind of my old
friend had shattered under the strain of his recent exertions. The
Queen was inhabiting you as easily as she had done those empty china
dolls, and she had sent you
to execute me just as she had sent those addle-pated monsters.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: He's coming closer.<br>
MIKE YATES: I should just shoot you, Mrs Wibbsey, and have done with
it. What use are you?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Now I know it isn't really you talking, Mike.<br>
MIKE YATES: All those years I watched you come and go, Doctor, doing
just as you pleased. Waltzing in, just when you liked. Saying and doing
just the right most brilliant thing at precisely the correct moment.
Saving the day again and again, and again.<br>
THE DOCTOR: But that's what I do. I can't help it.<br>
MIKE YATES: And what was I? I had no amazing flashes of inspiration. I
had no extraordinary or arcane knowledge or amazing powers. I had
nothing. I was just plodding along after you and the Brigadier.
Shooting at things occasionally, blowing them up. I was the butt of
your jokes, the some time cause of your outrage.<br>
THE DOCTOR: More than that, you were loyal. You overcame such odds.<br>
MIKE YATES: I could be so much more. There's so much more in here. But
I'm too old for that now. There's no chance any more for me to become
anything else.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Well, that comes to you all.<br>
MIKE YATES: Not to you. You get old and then ... shazam! A brand new
you, just as aggravating as the last one. Sooner or later you're going
to get younger. For all I know you're going to live a whole new life
again, and again. You live, Doctor, again, and again.<br>
THE DOCTOR: (sigh.) Give me the ballet slipper.<br>
MIKE YATES: What?<br>
THE DOCTOR: It's in your pocket. Give it to me right now.<br>
MIKE YATES: But ... I'm talking to you. Telling you.<br>
THE DOCTOR: You're ranting hysterically, like every other megalomaniac
or hypnotised lackey I have ever fought, in my extremely long,
fortunate and rather hectic life, and I don't have time for it. I don't
need to hear about your secret resentments and loathings, Mike. I've no
interest. What I'm bothered about is putting pay to the schemes of the
hornets and going home again. So, do you mind obliging?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: You could at least listen to the man.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Why? His mind has been utterly taken over. He's talking
nonsense. Give me the slipper.<br>
MIKE YATES: The Queen has offered me eternal life, Doctor. She has
offered me the chance to be you.<br>
THE DOCTOR: And that's not all it's cracked up to be now. Thanks for
this. I want you to snap out of it at once, Captain Yates. All of this
maudlin business really isn't like you.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) I was thinking on my feet, Mike, I hope you
realise that now, improvising madly as usual. Mrs Wibbsey says at that
point I bore down on you with a look that would have hypnotised a bull
elephant. I blocked your thoughts from the Queen for as long as I could
and then, you blinked at me, suddenly released into your own mind again.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: What's been happening?<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) The clever Doctor then used my
recently-acquired knowledge of the hive to locate the source of that
delicious-looking jelly that the Queen seemed so fond of.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: You want to take some home with us?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Come on, while the hornets are still fighting the fire.<br>
MIKE YATES: Fire? But the whole place will go up in a flash.<br>
THE DOCTOR: The hornets don't know how to stop it yet. They just keep
on fanning it with their wings. They'll find a way, though. They won't
let the hive be destroyed.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) So we set off under my sketchy directions.
While my mind had been swamped by the Queen's, I had gained a working
knowledge of the topography of the nest. So I suddenly knew that the
incubation chambers where the pupating young manufactured her Majesty's
favourite grog lay directly above her throne room. We clambered and
hauled ourselves up tunnels and tubes not made to accommodate humanoid
life-forms. Mrs Wibbsey and I made less than nimble companions as we
shimmied and slithered our way into the pupating chamber. And at last,
we were in a room filled with quivering grub-like bodies lying in waxy
trays.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: What are you planning to do, Doctor?<br>
THE DOCTOR: I'm mixing her a kind of cocktail. You see, the whole hive
depends upon her. If we can put her out of action, then their
intelligence breaks down. They revert to just being insects.<br>
MIKE YATES: (echoed) You wouldn't ... you wouldn't harm her?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Doctor, I think your hypnotism's wearing off. He's got
that funny look about him.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Distract him, would you, Wibbsey? I'm busy collecting up
this golden honey stuff.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Why on earth are you decanting it into that old slipper?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Like I say, it's live. It's still attuned to my dimensional
stabiliser. Ah! Now, isn't that a dainty dish to set before a Queen?<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Ugh!<br>
THE DOCTOR: Wibbsey.<br>
MIKE YATES: (echoed) She's here. She's back. Inside my mind.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Fight it, man. Would you really let yourself be
browbeaten, by a woman?<br>
MIKE YATES: (echoed) She's everywhere! She's in here, in the room.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) And so she was, Mike. Flanked by her
fiercest-looking hornet drones, the Queen had ascended into the
pupating chamber. She looked absolutely livid.<br>
<br>
THE QUEEN: What are you doing here? Do not destroy our swarm. They are
all infinitely precious to us.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Destroy them? Of course not.<br>
THE QUEEN: But you have brought fire into the nest. You are intent on
killing us all, Doctor.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Only as a very last resort. I hope to persuade you to
desist from your plans.<br>
THE QUEEN: Never. The plan will go on. They are already here. The
invasion is happening.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Well, I've heard that one before ... Mike, your hip-flask,
please.<br>
THE QUEEN: Don't listen to him. We are your Queen.<br>
MIKE YATES: But ... he's the Doctor. I must help him.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Good old Captain Yates. You resisted her every
inch of the way. Reached inside your Dack sports jacket, withdrew your
flask and flung it across the pupating chamber right into my hand.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: Of course. Whisky's inimical to the brutes.<br>
THE DOCTOR: What? Well actually, I just wanted a quick snifter before I
dealt with the Queen. But who needs alcohol when you have a
destabilising slipper?<br>
THE QUEEN: Do not interfere with the Royal Jelly. What is that vessel?<br>
THE DOCTOR: This? Oh, just some old footwear.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Doctor, can't you see the danger? Stop messing around.
Give her what she wants.<br>
THE DOCTOR: She doesn't want this. Nasty old thing, and somewhat ripe.<br>
THE QUEEN: You have stolen some of the Royal Jelly. No! You cannot take
it. Give it to us. Give it to me.<br>
THE DOCTOR: What, this?<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: (narrating) Her hornet drones were surrounding us by now.
We were flanked on all sides, and everything looked pretty hopeless.
But I saw a certain look in the Queen's glittering faceted eyes. Greed,
and desire. The sweetness and the sting of the Royal Jelly made her
drool with anticipated pleasure. Even though her pantry was packed to
the rafters, she wanted every last drop for herself.<br>
<br>
THE DOCTOR: This, your Majesty? Oh, go on, then. Have it your own way.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) Then the Doctor held out the slipper, just like
Prince Charming holding the shoe for the foulest of the Ugly Sisters,
and slowly the Queen hauled her distended body towards him, clacking
her pincers and buzzing her wings, overcome by feverish greed. Funny
for one so caught up in the life of the mind to be so prey to bodily
need. She snatched the slipper from his hands and
drank deeply, imbibing the jelly and making the most horrendous noises.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: I can feel her influence ebbing.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Her mind must be on other things.<br>
<br>
(Sonic screwdriver operating.)<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) But the Doctor shook his head, and showed us
the sonic screwdriver, which he had set to trigger the latent
vibrations in the slipper itself, and its connection with the
dimensional stabilisers. He was playing the Queen at her own game,
tapping into her weird powers. He had activated the slipper, and set it
to do exactly what it had once done to him.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: She's shrinking. But how can she, we're all minuscule as
it is.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Galaxies within galaxies. Remember, Mrs Wibbsey?<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) The hornet guards were quivering with
incomprehension, because as the Queen rapidly shrank and thrashed
about, she was losing her grip on their minds, on everyone's mind. So
horrified was she at what was happening to her, her perfect control was
lost.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: I don't believe it.<br>
MIKE YATES: You've done it, Doctor.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Quick, hide the slipper. We don't want it falling into the
wrong feelers.<br>
THE QUEEN: This destruction is pitiless.<br>
THE DOCTOR: This isn't destruction. It's just desserts.<br>
THE QUEEN: Help me, please! Come to me, aides.<br>
MIKE YATES: She's tiny. Quick, tread on her.<br>
THE DOCTOR: No Mike, there's no need for that. She'll get a good deal
tinier. I'm exiling her alone to another universe, the micro universe.
Away from her own kind, she'll be just another insect. Beyond the
swarm, beyond everything, where she can do no more harm.<br>
THE QUEEN: Please, save me.<br>
(Noise of miniaturisation stops.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: That's incredible.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, you sounded actually impressed then, for a
second.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: But the rest of the hornets, how will we escape them?<br>
THE DOCTOR: There's no-one in control now, the swarm's in anarchy.<br>
MIKE YATES: And the hive still burns.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Perhaps we'd better run for it.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) And so we ran, hampered at every turn by smoke
and maddened hornets. We picked up what weapons we could to batter them
back, and make our way into the outer layers of the papery brain.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: We're not going to make it.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Oh yes we are. Do you really doubt it, Mike?<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) The hornets were a lost cause without their
Queen. They reverted to pure insect instinct. They used their brute
strength to batter to bits the strange origami architecture of their
city. They swarmed towards the open air. All we had to do was to dodge
the flames and get out before they did. We emerged from one of the
animal's eyes...<br>
(Sonic screwdriver operated.)<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) ... and the Doctor activated the slipper one
last time, in order to return us to our natural size.<br>
<br>
(Miniaturisation ray reversed. MRS WIBBSEY gasps.)<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: We're back.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) The miraculous ballet shoe was a dreadful soggy
mess by now, and the Doctor tossed it onto the lifeless, smouldering
wreck of the zebra.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Well, I'd better open all the windows, let some of the
smoke out.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Mrs Wibbsey, don't touch those sash cords.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Whyever not?<br>
THE DOCTOR: It may have escaped your attention, but every single alien
hornet is currently contained within the zebra.<br>
MIKE YATES: Not for long. They're all about to follow us out.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Another adjustment to the dimensional stabiliser.<br>
<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) Suddenly the air round the zebra shimmered, and
turned slightly opaque.<br>
(Force field operation noise.)<br>
MIKE YATES: (narrating) As the Doctor's gadget surrounded the creature
in a miniature version of his invisible bell jar.<br>
<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Are they sealed in there for good?<br>
THE DOCTOR: Yes. Or at least until I take them somewhere to release
them.<br>
MIKE YATES: Could you make it a very, very distant galaxy, please,
Doctor?<br>
THE DOCTOR: (laugh) Mike, Mrs Wibbsey - dear Mrs Wibbsey - you were
both brilliant. Not only did we confront the Queen and cut her down to
size, we lured every single hornet back to the hive to be sealed in
there for ... well, if not for life then at least for Christmas.<br>
MIKE YATES: Hey, I'd completely forgotten. It's Christmas Eve.<br>
MRS WIBBSEY: Well, I'd better get down to the village for some more
parsnips.<br>
THE DOCTOR: You'll need your wellies, Mrs Wibbsey. It's snowing.<br>
MIKE YATES: I said those clouds looked threatening.<br>
THE DOCTOR: Less threatening than a swarm of hornets though, eh Mike?
Ha-ha. <br>(Salvation Army band starts playing Good King Wenceslas outside.)<br>
MIKE YATES: But can the Queen do any further harm, Doctor?<br>
THE DOCTOR: I hope not. I sincerely hope not.<br>(<i>And here ends the radio broadcast.</i>)<br><br>(Clock ticking in the background.)<br>MIKE
YATES: Well, that was the best Christmas dinner I've had in years. I
really ought to help Mrs Wibbsey with the dishes. Do you remember those
old UNIT Christmas parties, Doctor?<br>THE DOCTOR: How could I forget?<br>MIKE YATES: They were happy times. Perhaps you'll come to the New Year's Reunion with me.<br>THE
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Mike, I have places to go. Once I've collected the
TARDIS and made sure Mrs Wibbsey is accepted into village life, she can
live here now, in the cottage.<br>MIKE YATES: So you'll be moving on again?<br>THE
DOCTOR: Would you mind taking your namesake, Captain? I wouldn't ask,
it's just that I've already got a dog. There may be ructions.<br>MIKE YATES: Of course. What about the rest of it? All your relics, the stuffed animals, the goblin man and so on. <br>THE DOCTOR: Percy Noggins is taking everything for his private collection. It's all quite harmless now. <br>MIKE
YATES: Well, Doctor, I really must say it's been a pleasure. I thought
I was too old for all these shenanigans of yours. I'm sorry I went a
bit wobbly back there. I don't know how she got to me. <br>THE DOCTOR:
Don't forget the Queen had a good poke around in my subconscious too.
Nasty business. But all's well that ends with a nice glass of something
by the fire, eh?<br>MIKE YATES: Indeed. Look, the snow's falling pretty
thickly now. It'll be deep, I should think. Perhaps you won't be able
to get away as soon after all.<br>THE DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure I will. I have to, you see. There's so much more for me to do. Ah, Mrs Wibbsey.<br>MRS WIBBSEY: I put some stuffed dates on a plate, and a couple of mince pies.<br>THE DOCTOR: Oh, presentation is everything, Mrs Wibbsey. Will you join us for some elderberry punch? It's non-alcoholic. <br>MRS WIBBSEY: I should think so too. I've left the claggiest dishes to soak. Blinking bread sauce.<br>MIKE YATES: Those parsnips were excellent, Mrs Wibbsey. <br>MRS WIBBSEY: Well, they are my speciality. Oh, well, just a small one then. <br>THE DOCTOR: That's the spirit. Now then, a toast.<br>(Church organ playing Good King Wenceslas in the background.)<br>THE DOCTOR: To past and future times.<br>MIKE YATES + MRS WIBBSEY: To past and future times.<br>THE DOCTOR: And, of course, Merry Christmas. (laughs.)<br>
