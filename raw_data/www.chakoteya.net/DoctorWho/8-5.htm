of Aldbourne in Wiltshire pretends to be Devil's End, with an
appropriate eerie howling wind and thunderstorm. Lightning
briefly&nbsp; illuminates the church across the green as the public
house, the Cloven Hoof, turns out its last customers - a man and his
dog - into the storm.) <br>
JIM: Goodnight, Frank. <br>
FRANK [OC]: Goodnight, Jim. <br>
(By the churchyard, the dog gets free of his master and runs through
the gravestones, barking. Jim follows, and we hear a strange noise as a
look of terror comes over his face.) </font></p>

eccentric spinster is walking along with the local doctor.) <br>
HAWTHORNE: He died of fright, Doctor. <br>
REEVES: My dear Miss Hawthorne <br>
HAWTHORNE: I don't care what you say. The man died of fright! <br>
REEVES: My dear Miss Hawthorne, the medical diagnosis was quite clear.
He died of a heart attack. <br>
HAWTHORNE: But his face? <br>
REEVES: Slight protrusion of the eyeballs, rictus drawing of the lips
back over the teeth. Common enough in heart failure. <br>
HAWTHORNE: The signs are there for all to see! I cast the runes only
this morning. <br>
REEVES You'll have to excuse me. I have my rounds to do. <br>
(Doctor Reeves gets into his car.) <br>
HAWTHORNE: If Professor Horner opens up that barrow, he will bring
disaster on us all! <br>

HARRY: Hello, Alastair. What's up? <br>
FERGUS: Where's Professor Horner? <br>
HARRY: Probably in make up, unless he's had second thoughts and
scarpered. <br>
FERGUS: What? <br>
HARRY: Well, you know the local chat. Death and disaster if he opens
the barrow. <br>

DOCTOR: So? <br>
JO: Well, that means the occult. Well, you know, the supernatural and
all that magic bit. <br>
DOCTOR: You know, really, Jo, I'm obviously wasting my time trying to
turn you into a scientist. <br>
JO: Well, how do you know there's nothing in it? <br>
DOCTOR: How? Well, I just know, that's all. Everything that happens in
life must have a scientific explanation. If you know where to look for
it, that is. Excuse me. <br>
JO: Yes, but suppose something was to happen and nobody knew the
explanation. Well, nobody in the world, in the universe. Well, that
would be magic, wouldn't it? <br>
DOCTOR: You know, Jo, for a reasonably intelligent young lady, you do
have the most absurd ideas. <br>
(Bessie starts up and drives off.) <br>

DOCTOR: Very well, I forgive you. Now go back to your parking place

YATES: I know there's a good explanation for all this but I just can't
think of it for the moment. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you believe magic? <br>
YATES: Magic? <br>
DOCTOR: Hmm. <br>
YATES: No! <br>
DOCTOR: Well, Jo would. <br>
JO: That's not fair. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you explain it then. <br>
JO: I don't know. I suppose you did it. <br>
DOCTOR: Naturally. Or should I say scientifically. Solenoids and a
solar mechanism in Bessie and <br>

DOCTOR: A radio control unit here. You see how easy it is to be a
magician? <br>
JO: How infuriating can you get. Well, it doesn't prove anything. <br>
DOCTOR: Would you like me to show you some more then? <br>
JO: No thanks, I've had enough of your knavish tricks. Anyway, I want

DOCTOR: Coming where? <br>
YATES: Well, to see that programme. <br>

DOCTOR: Captain Yates, you astound me. <br>
YATES: Well, you never know. Devil's End has a funny reputation. <br>

it ain't. Alastair Fergus is speaking direct to camera, his voice
echoing eerily in the dark undercroft.) <br>
FERGUS: Devil's End. The very name sends a shiver up the spine. The
witches of Devil's End, the famous curse, the notorious cavern
underneath the church where the third Lord of Aldbourne played at his
eighteen century parody of black magic. Devil's End is part of the dark
mythology of our childhood days. And now, for the first time, the
cameras of the BBC have been allowed inside the cavern itself. In this
cavern, pagan man performed his unspeakable rites. In this cavern, the
witches of the seventeenth century hid from the fires of Matthew
Hopkins, witch-hunter extraordinary. In this cavern. But I could go on
all day. <br>
(Fergus goes past a tableau of devil worship to a cross-legged
gargoyle, its chin resting on its hands.) <br>
FERGUS: There is something strange about Devil's End. Is Professor
Horner being as foolish as his critics would suggest? I must admit,
standing here in this unquiet place, I'm beginning to wonder myself.

(And cues Fergus, standing outside the tunnel entrance.) <br>
FERGUS: While I was recording that earlier this afternoon, the
archaeological dig was proceeding apace. Professor Horner and his team
have cut their way into the Devil's Hump, as this barrow is called by
the locals, as if it were a giant pie. But now the question is can
Professor Horner pull out his plum. <br>
HORNER: Get on with it, man. <br>
FERGUS: Or will the Professor be proved disastrously wrong?

FERGUS [on TV]: For some two hundred years, the controversy has raged.
What is the Devil's Hump. Now, we're not the first to try and find out.
But from 1793, when Sir Percival Flint's miners ran back to Cornwall
leaving him for dead to the famous Cambridge University fiasco of 1939 <br>

JO: Has it started yet? <br>
BENTON: Shush. <br>

solved. </font></p>

tunnel to a large stone blocking their way.) <br>
HORNER: There, that's the spot. Six inches behind there lies the
greatest archaeological find this country has known since Sutton Hoo. <br>
FERGUS: Would you like to explain that reference, Professor? <br>
HORNER: No. And at midnight tonight <br>
FERGUS: Sutton Hoo, of course <br>
HORNER: Never mind about Sutton Hoo. This is what your precious viewers
are interested in. The Devil's Hump and what's inside it, right? <br>
FERGUS: And what is inside it? <br>
HORNER: Treasure, that's what. The tomb of a great warrior chieftain,
bronze age, 800 BC. <br>
FERGUS: You're very precise? <br>
HORNER: No need to take my word for it. See for yourself, midnight. <br>
FERGUS: Ah yes, now then, why midnight and why tonight? <br>
HORNER: Well, it's obvious. April 30th is Beltane, isn't it? <br>
FERGUS: Beltane? <br>
HORNER: You know, you ought to have done your homework before you came
on this dig. <br>
FERGUS: For the viewers, Professor. <br>
HORNER: April the 30th, Beltane, greatest occult festival of the year,
bar Halloween.

DOCTOR: Beltane. Of course. <br>
HORNER [on TV]: You've heard the tales about this place? The ghosts,
the witches, the curse. The famous curse. <br>

HORNER [on TV] Do you? <br>
FERGUS [on TV]: Well then, why have you? <br>

FERGUS [on TV]: Oh. Then it's what one might call a publicity gimmick. <br>

colleagues to <br>
DOCTOR: You know, there's something dreadfully wrong here. <br>
JO: Hey, you really mean that, don't you? <br>

green. <br>

FERGUS: Now this is Miss Hawthorne, a prominent local resident who's
very much opposed to Professor Horner's dig. Professor Horner, I
believe you two have already met? <br>
HORNER: I'll say. The daft woman's been pestering me for weeks. <br>
HAWTHORNE: I've been trying to make you see reason. <br>
FERGUS: Miss Hawthorne, why are you so opposed to this dig? <br>
HAWTHORNE: Because this man is tampering with forces he does not
understand. <br>
HORNER: Oh, come on now. <br>
HAWTHORNE: You'll bring destruction on yourself and upon the whole area
if you persist. Death and disaster await you. Believe me, I know. <br>
FERGUS: But that's just it. Why should we believe you and how do you
know? <br>
HAWTHORNE: I'm a witch. <br>

you should listen to me. I know! <br>

It's written in the stars. When Beltane is come, tread softly, for lo,

WINSTANLEY: Well, no, but there have been a lot of queer goings on the

hens have stopped laying. <br>

door, so you'd better watch out. You see, I've nothing to lose, have I?
<br>
MASTER: Enough! Azal, destroy him! <br>
AZAL: Who is this?! <br>
MASTER: My enemy and yours, Azal. Destroy him! <br>
AZAL: This is the one we spoke of. He too is not of this planet. <br>
MASTER: He is a meddler and a fool. <br>
AZAL: He is not a fool, yet he has done a foolish thing coming here.
Why did you come? <br>
DOCTOR: I came to talk to you. <br>
AZAL: Talk then. <br>
DOCTOR: Certainly. But first let her go. <br>
MASTER: No! <br>
(Azal sends electricity at the acolytes holding Jo, and they free her.)
<br>
JO: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Are you all right, Jo? <br>
JO: I am now. <br>
AZAL: You wish to talk? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. I want you to leave this planet while you still can. <br>
AZAL: You are bold. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? I've got a machine outside that can annihilate you. <br>
AZAL: You lie. <br>
DOCTOR: You've already felt its power. <br>
AZAL: It is destroyed. <br>
DOCTOR: One of them, yes. Not both. <br>
AZAL: You lie. There was but one. <br>
JO: Doctor? <br>
AZAL: You have a regard for truth. Why do you lie? <br>
DOCTOR: To try and make you listen to me. <br>
AZAL: Why should I? I see no consequence of value. <br>
MASTER: Then kill him. Kill him now! <br>
AZAL: Very well. <br>
(Azal aims his hand at the Doctor.) <br>
JO: No! <br>
DOCTOR: If you kill me now, you will wonder throughout eternity whether
you should have listened to my words.

get the bazooka set up over there, quick. <br>

him, Azal! <br>
AZAL: I command. I do not obey. <br>
MASTER: But I called you here and you came? <br>
AZAL: I answered your call because the time was come for my awakening.
The time has come for the completion of the experiment or its
destruction. <br>
MASTER: Then fulfill your mission by granting the ultimate power to me.
Who else is there strong enough to give these humans the leadership
they need? <br>
DOCTOR: I seem to remember somebody else speaking like that. What was
the bounder's name? Hitler. Yes, that's right, Adolf Hitler. Or was it
Genghis Khan? <br>
MASTER: Azal, I have the will. You yourself said so. <br>
AZAL: I am still not convinced. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm very pleased to hear it. <br>
AZAL: You wish to see this planet destroyed? <br>
DOCTOR: By no means. You see, I have an alternative. <br>
AZAL: State it. <br>
DOCTOR: Leave humanity alone. Just go. You've done enough harm. <br>
AZAL: We gave knowledge to man. <br>
DOCTOR: You certainly did. Thanks to you man can now blow up the world
and he probably will. He can poison the water and the very air he
breathes. He's already started. He can <br>
AZAL: Enough! Is man such a failure then? Shall I destroy him? <br>
MASTER: No! A strong leader can force him to learn. <br>
AZAL: You are right. I have decided. I shall pass on my power. <br>
MASTER: O mighty Azal, I thank you. <br>
AZAL: But not to you. To him. <br>
DOCTOR: No! No, I don't want it!

behind gravestones. Benton brings the bazooka to the retaining wall and
takes aim.) <br>
YATES: Fire! <br>

BRIGADIER: Well done, Sergeant. <br>
BENTON: Just a minute, sir. Look! <br>

DOCTOR: Of course I do! Don't you understand? I want you to leave. I
want you to go away and give man a chance to grow up. <br>
AZAL: I cannot. My instructions are precise. I bequeath my power or I
destroy all. <br>
MASTER: Then you will give your power to me? <br>
AZAL: I shall. Time is short. <br>
MASTER: What about him? <br>
AZAL: He is not rational. He is disruptive. He must be eliminated. <br>

stands in front of him.) <br>
JO: No! No, he's a good man! Kill me, not him! <br>
(Jo braces herself for the kill shot, but Azal clutches his wrist in
pain as his power turns in on himself.) <br>
AZAL: This action does not relate. There is no data. It does not
relate. Go! Leave me, all of you! <br>

the church goes KaBOOM!! throwing the runners to the ground. The women
come out of their homes and Benton trains his pistol on the Master.) <br>
BENTON: Get up. Don't try anything. <br>
BRIGADIER: What happened in there, Doctor? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, by a ridiculous and foolhardy act of self-sacrifice, Jo
here has managed to save us. <br>
JO: I did? <br>
DOCTOR: You did. You see, Azal couldn't face an act as irrational and
as illogical as her being prepared to give up her life for me. Look,
Jo, why don't you go and get out of that ridiculous garb? <br>
JO: Okay. <br>
YATES: So what happened? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, all his power was turned against himself. You might say
he blew a fuse. <br>
(Boom!) <br>
YATES: Greyhound Two, come in, please. Over. <br>
CHALMERS [OC]: Chalmers here at the dig, sir. Are you all right? Over, <br>
YATES: Couldn't be better. What's happening? <br>
CHALMERS [OC]: Big bang at the dig, sir. <br>
DOCTOR: The spaceship. Automatic self-destruct, I suppose. <br>
CHALMERS [OC]: And the barrier's cleared itself. Over. <br>
YATES: Good show. We're coming out now with one prisoner. Over and out.
<br>
BRIGADIER: Benton, get ready to move out. <br>
BENTON: Yes, sir. Right, you lot, you heard the man. The picnic's over.

(The Master throws his cope over Benton and runs to Bessie. Benton
shoots at him and the Brigadier joins in as the Master drives away.) <br>
DOCTOR: Stop firing. You'll damage Bessie. <br>
BRIGADIER: Do you want him to get away? <br>
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Bessie'll bring him back. <br>
(Jo is back in her proper clothes as Bessie turns a circle and returns
the prisoner.) <br>
BRIGADIER: How on Earth did you do that? <br>
DOCTOR: Simple, if you know how. <br>
BRIGADIER: Right, Benton, get them moved out. And take him with you.
Maximum security guard. <br>
BENTON: Yes, sir. Right, get moving! <br>
DOCTOR: And look after him. I want to deal with him later. <br>
MASTER: Do you, Doctor? You always were an optimist, weren't you. <br>
DOCTOR: Thank you for the compliment. <br>
BENTON: All right, move. <br>
(The Master gets out of Bessie and into the back of a Land Rover,
accompanied by six burly soldiers with their rifles pointing at him,
and is driven away. The villagers boo him as he leaves.) <br>
HAWTHORNE: Listen. <br>
DOCTOR: To what? <br>
JO: Yes, the birds are singing again. <br>
HAWTHORNE: Oh, and smell the flowers. <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it makes a change from the smell of sulphur, doesn't
it? <br>
HAWTHORNE: The May day miracle has happened again. The Earth is born
anew. <br>
(The morris starts up again.) <br>
BENTON: All under way, sir. <br>
HAWTHORNE: Sergeant, we must do the fertility dance to celebrate. <br>
BENTON: Oh, no, I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm still rather busy. <br>
HAWTHORNE: Oh, nonsense, Sergeant. Come along. <br>
JO: Come on, Doctor. <br>
YATES: Fancy a dance, Brigadier? <br>
BRIGADIER: It's kind of you, Captain Yates. I think I'd rather have a
pint. <br>
(The May pole is being wrapped in its ribbons once again.) <br>
DOCTOR: (dancing) You're right, Jo, there is magic in the world after
all. </font> </p>
