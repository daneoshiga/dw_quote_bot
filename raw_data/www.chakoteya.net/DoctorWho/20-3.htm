<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Welcome to Trent Park, Enfield Chase, Middlesex,
and a lovely view of the obelisk through the trees. A group of boys are
doing a cross country run while another is lovingly polishing the
bonnet of a grand old motor car, registration JA566. Note for
non-British - a Public School in the UK is an expensive fee-paying
establishment. Think Eton or Winchester.) <br>
IBBOTSON: A 1929 Humber 16/50 open tourer, Imperial model. Do you
realise this car has the same chassis as the three and a half litre
Humber Super Snipe? <br>
TURLOUGH: Crude, heavy and inefficient. <br>
(Everyone say Hi! to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834427/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mark
Strickson.</a>) <br>
IBBOTSON: This car is a classic, Turlough. <br>
TURLOUGH: It's dull and fat and ugly. Just like you, Hippo. <br>
(Turlough opens the passenger's door.) <br>
IBBOTSON: Turlough! <br>
TURLOUGH: We're going for a ride. <br>
IBBOTSON: You can't drive the car! <br>
TURLOUGH: Watch me. <br>
IBBOTSON: We'll be caught. <br>
TURLOUGH: Who will know? <br>
IBBOTSON: Oh, Turlough, we can't. <br>
TURLOUGH: Oh, come on, Hippo. Just to the end of the drive and back.
You're not afraid, are you? Come on. <br>
(Turlough pushes Ibbotson into the vehicle.) <br>
IBBOTSON: Turlough! <br>
(Turlough gets behind the steering wheel, starts the engine, puts it
into gear and drives off to cheers from the watching boys. Out he goes
through the main gates and onto the public road.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Car]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> IBBOTSON: Hey, you said just to the end of the
drive. But you haven't got a license, Turlough. <br>
TURLOUGH: So, who needs one? <br>
IBBOTSON: Oh, go back to the school, please. Oh Turlough, slow down,
please. You're on the wrong side of the road, Turlough! <br>
TURLOUGH: This car's a classic. Isn't that what you said, Hippo? <br>
IBBOTSON: Look out! <br>
(They meet a van coming the other way on the single track road. There
is a screech of brakes and Turlough steers the Humber through a break
in the hedgerow and into a field. Then we get treated to a special
effect and an aerial view of the accident victims being treated by the
police, a doctor and a couple of gowned masters.) </font></p>

Dyall wearing a dead black chicken on his head. Everyone remember the
Black Guardian from the Key to Time season?) <br>
TURLOUGH: Who are you? <br>
GUARDIAN: A friend. <br>
TURLOUGH: What is this place? <br>
GUARDIAN: There's no need to be afraid. <br>
TURLOUGH: Then tell me who you are. <br>
GUARDIAN: Your guardian. One who has your interests at heart. <br>
TURLOUGH: Am I dead? <br>
GUARDIAN: Merely sleeping. <br>
TURLOUGH: I don't think I'd really care if I were. I hate Earth. <br>
GUARDIAN: You would like to leave? <br>
TURLOUGH: Is it possible? <br>
GUARDIAN: All things are possible. <br>
TURLOUGH: Then get me away from here, please. <br>
GUARDIAN: But first, we should have to discuss terms. </font></p>

Just a slight concussion. <br>
HEADMASTER: It's a wonder they weren't both killed. What's the damage
at your end, Brigadier? <br>
(Alistair Lethbridge Stewart, no longer in uniform, looks up from the
wreckage of his motor car. It should have been Ian Chesterton, but
circumstances prevented. Shame.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Eh? In thirty years of soldiering, I've never encountered
such destructive power as I have seen displayed here and now by the
British schoolboy. Well, how is he? <br>
RUNCIMAN: He's been lucky, He'll be all right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Limbo]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> GUARDIAN: We haven't much longer. I need to know
that I have your assent to our arrangement. You will find me the most
accommodating of partners. <br>
TURLOUGH: But murder. I'm not sure I could go that far. <br>
GUARDIAN: You will be destroying one of the most evil creatures in the
universe. He calls himself the Doctor. <br>
TURLOUGH: Why can't you destroy him? You have the powers. <br>
GUARDIAN: I may not be seen to act in this. I must not be involved. <br>
TURLOUGH: I need time to think. <br>
GUARDIAN: There is no time. Yes or no? <br>
TURLOUGH: Don't send me back to Earth, please. <br>
(Turlough begins to fade.) <br>
GUARDIAN: Yes or no? <br>
TURLOUGH: Yes. <br>
(Turlough vanishes. The Black Guardian laughs his deep, evil laugh.) </font></p>

RUNCIMAN: He's coming round. <br>
BRIGADIER: Steady on, old chap. You had a bit of a knock. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEGAN: Doctor? I am free of the Mara, aren't I? <br>
DOCTOR: Tegan, Tegan, Tegan. <br>
TEGAN: I'm scared. <br>
DOCTOR: There isn't any need to be. <br>
TEGAN: I'm still having terrible dreams. <br>
DOCTOR: It's your mind's way of coping with the experience. You've
suffered a great deal. <br>
TEGAN: That could have been prevented if that Dojjen person had
destroyed the Great Crystal. <br>
DOCTOR: No, he couldn't. The Mara during the process of its becoming.
It had to be trapped between modes of its being. <br>
TEGAN: The feelings of hate. Doctor, I couldn't go through it again. <br>
DOCTOR: Well, you're completely free of it now, Tegan. For you, the
Mara is dead forever. <br>
NYSSA: For all of us, I hope. <br>
(Nyssa has changed the gaudy outfit of the previous story for a denim
mini-dress and flat mid-calf boots.) <br>
DOCTOR: Indeed. <br>
TEGAN: Can you take me back to Earth? <br>
NYSSA: You want to leave us? <br>
TEGAN: I want to rest. I want to be surrounded by familiar things. <br>
NYSSA: You'll forget the Mara, Tegan. It won't always be as painful as
it is now. <br>
(The Tardis jerks, throwing them sideways.) <br>
DOCTOR: Warp ellipse cut out? <br>
NYSSA: Can't be. That would mean we were near an object in a fixed
orbit in time as well as space. <br>
DOCTOR: And what's the probability of that? <br>
NYSSA: Several billion to one against. <br>
TEGAN: Are you trying to scare me, or is this your way of telling me
we've broken down again? <br>
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it's much more serious than that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MATRON: Right, into bed with you, young man. <br>
TURLOUGH: Oh, Matron, I'm perfectly all right. <br>
MATRON: Mild concussion and shock. You heard what Doctor Runciman said.
We don't want complications, do we? <br>
TURLOUGH: I'm not going to bed. <br>
MATRON: Just this once you can do as you're told. You're in enough hot
water already. <br>
(Turlough obeys, then sees a curious crystal on the bedside table.) <br>
TURLOUGH: Matron, where did this come from? <br>
MATRON: It was in your jacket, and that was in a fine old mess, I don't
mind telling you. <br>
(The Headmaster enters. Turlough puts the crystal under his pillow.) <br>
MATRON: Good afternoon, Headmaster. <br>
HEADMASTER: Is it, I wonder. Well, Turlough, how are you feeling? <br>
TURLOUGH: Much better, thank you, sir. <br>
HEADMASTER: Which is more than the Brigadier can say for his car. I
don't understand you. You make no effort at games, you refuse to join
the CCF, you do little or no work in class though you have a first-rate
mind, and now this. <br>
TURLOUGH: I wasn't driving, you know, sir. <br>
HEADMASTER: What? <br>
TURLOUGH: The Brigadier's car. <br>
HEADMASTER: But Ibbotson said <br>
TURLOUGH: I didn't want Ibbotson to get into trouble, sir. I only went
along in case he got hurt. I knew he wasn't really able to drive it,
and, well <br>
HEADMASTER: I see. <br>
MATRON: Ahem. Turlough must get some sleep, Headmaster. <br>
HEADMASTER: Of course, Matron. I'll look in again later. <br>
(The Headmaster and Matron leave. Turlough gets the crystal out and
looks at it. Suddenly it glows.) <br>
TURLOUGH: So you are real. I thought it was just a dream. <br>
GUARDIAN [OC]: Waking or sleeping, I shall be with you until our
business is concluded. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Tardis]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NYSSA: Are we safe? <br>
DOCTOR: There's a chance something's on a collision course with the
Tardis. <br>
TEGAN: Don't you know? <br>
(Nyssa turns on the scanner.) <br>
DOCTOR: Well, there's a chance of anything. Statistically speaking, if
you gave typewriters to a tree full of monkeys, they'd eventually
produce the works of William Shakespeare. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Now, you and I know that at the end of the millennium they'd
still be tapping out gibberish. <br>
DOCTOR: And you'd be tapping it out right along side them. I only asked
you a simple question. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor, something's coming straight for us! <br>
(The sharp prow of a spaceship is bearing down on the Tardis.) <br>
NYSSA: We've got to get out of the way. <br>
DOCTOR: We can't. We've converged with the warp ellipse. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor! <br>
DOCTOR: Hold this steady. <br>
TEGAN: We're going to crash. <br>
DOCTOR: I'll try and materialise on board the ship. Hold tight! <br>
(The Tardis materialises on the marble floor of a very posh room.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TURLOUGH: Why am I still on Earth? <br>
GUARDIAN: Patience, Turlough. Already the elements of chance are ranged
against the Doctor. Soon he will be separated from the Tardis and in
your power. Go to the hill, boy, to the obelisk, and wait. There I will
instruct you further. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Outside the Headmaster's study]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> HEADMASTER {OC]: You realise, Ibbotson, what you
did is a criminal offence. If it weren't for the good name of the
school, I'd hand you both over to the police. <br>
(A pair of passing boys find this fascinating and stop to listen at the
door.) <br>
HEADMASTER [OC]: I shall be writing to your parents, needless to say. <br>
BRIGADIER: Ahem. <br>
(The boys leave. Ibbotson leaves the study and bumps into the
Brigadier.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah, Ibbotson. And what have you got to say for yourself? <br>
IBBOTSON: Please, sir, I'm very sorry, sir, but it wasn't my fault,
honestly. I'm really sorry, sir. <br>
(Ibbotson leaves and the Headmaster comes out.) <br>
BRIGADIER: Ah, Headmaster. I trust you flogged that young man within an
inch of his life? <br>
HEADMASTER: Thank you, Brigadier, but I feel that we should wait until
Turlough is restored to health before we take any legal or disciplinary
action. <br>
BRIGADIER: You realise that car was unique? <br>
HEADMASTER: Quite, but I feel sure that you will agree that we must do
what is best for the school. <br>
BRIGADIER: Yes, well. Oh, if you say so, Headmaster. Mind, you can't
really take it out on Ibbotson. It's my view that he was led into this
by Turlough. Oh, we've got a rotten one there. <br>
HEADMASTER: I'm not so sure. I had a word with Turlough. He said he
only went along to protect Ibbotson. <br>
BRIGADIER: Pah. Cunning as a fox. You don't believe him, of course. <br>
HEADMASTER: I don't know. I'd be reluctant to jeopardise the boy's
future. <br>
BRIGADIER: Have you spoken to his parents? <br>
HEADMASTER: I thought you knew. They're dead. I deal with a solicitor
in London, and a very strange man he is, too. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>[Sickbay]</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (Turlough pretends to sleep as the door opens.) <br>
IBBOTSON: Are you awake, Turlough? <br>
TURLOUGH: What do you want? <br>
IBBOTSON: Listen, the Head's going to write to my parents. The police
may be called into investigate. We could be expelled. <br>
TURLOUGH: It's all right, Hippo. I've spoken to the Head. I told him it
was all my fault. <br>
IBBOTSON: I say, did you really, Turlough? <br>
TURLOUGH: So you won't get the boot, just beaten, I expect. <br>
IBBOTSON: Oh. Well, they'll beat you when you're better. <br>
TURLOUGH: Oh no, they won't. <br>
(Turlough throws back the bedclothes to reveal he is fully dressed. He
takes the crystal and heads for the door.) <br>
IBBOTSON: Hey, you can't get up until Doctor Runciman says so. <br>
TURLOUGH: Goodbye, Hippo. <br>
IBBOTSON: Oh, Turlough, you can't leave me on my own! Oh please,
Turlough! </font></p>

NYSSA: No sign of any passengers. <br>
TEGAN: Probably having cocktails with the Captain. <br>
NYSSA: What? <br>
TEGAN: Well, I mean it's more like the Queen Mary than a spaceship. <br>
(They walk on a little way.) <br>
TEGAN: I take it back. It's not the Queen Mary, it's the Marie Celeste.
You'd think on a long journey they'd want something a little more
cheerful. <br>
(The Doctor walks into a corner that suddenly lights up to reveal gold
busts in niches. He steps out and the lights go out again. Then they go
over to what seems to be a games machine which is beeping to itself.) <br>
NYSSA: Everything on this ship is designed for pleasure. <br>
DOCTOR: I have a weird feeling the warp ellipse will be travelling for
a very long time. Possibly through infinity. <br>
NYSSA: Well, it's certainly no prison ship. <br>

TEGAN: Is the Brigadier dead? <br>
DOCTOR: I don't think so. <br>
NYSSA: Doctor. <br>
(Brig '83 is also on the floor, but starting to wake up.) <br>
DOCTOR: It's all right, old friend. <br>
BRIG '83: Oh, sorry about that, Headmaster. Touch of vertigo. It won't
happen again. What the devil's been going on? <br>
DOCTOR: Nyssa, I want you to take the Brigadier back to the Tardis,
right to the centre, and keep him there until I give you the all clear.
You'll be quite safe. <br>
(Nyssa and Brig '83 leave.) <br>
TEGAN: This one must be all right. He belongs in 1977. <br>
(The Doctor goes to the regeneration unit.) <br>
DOCTOR: Amazing. The Brigadier's timing. A millisecond either way and <br>
TEGAN: And what? <br>
DOCTOR: At the moment of transfer, the power didn't come from me. <br>
TEGAN: Where did it come from? <br>
DOCTOR: Well, from the Tardis, really. The two Brigadiers just shorted
out the time differential. <br>
TEGAN: You mean zap? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Zap. <br>
TEGAN: Can Nyssa and I still time travel? <br>
DOCTOR: You're as good as new. <br>
TEGAN: Can you still regenerate? <br>
DOCTOR: I am a Time Lord. <br>
TEGAN: Look at Mawdryn. <br>
MAWDRYN: It is finished, Doctor. Can this be death? <br>
(Mawdryn dies.) <br>
TEGAN: They're all dead. <br>
DOCTOR: They would have travelled for the rest of time, Tegan. Death
was all they wanted. Come on, we must get the Brigadier back to 1977. <br>
TEGAN: Before we go, Doctor, thank you. You were prepared to risk
everything for us. <br>
DOCTOR: Come on. </font></p>

TEGAN: What's that noise? <br>
DOCTOR: The ship is dying with the mutants. <br>
TEGAN: It's come out of orbit? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes. Hurry. <br>

RUNCIMAN: Brigadier? <br>
(Tegan and the Doctor carry Brig '77 out and lay him on the grass, then
run back into the Tardis.) <br>
RUNCIMAN: Brigadier, what happened? I came as soon as I got your
message. <br>
(The Tardis dematerialises. The Brigadier stares at it.) <br>
RUNCIMAN: You'll be all right. </font></p>

in here, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: One has to move with the times. How are you feeling? <br>
BRIG '83: Haven't felt so well for, for at least six years. <br>
DOCTOR: There we are, 1983. Back to school, Brigadier. <br>
(When everyone has left, Turlough comes in from the interior and starts
messing with the controls.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> DOCTOR: Goodbye. <br>
BRIG '83: Goodbye, Doctor. If ever you're passing. Where's Turlough? <br>
DOCTOR: Turlough. He left in the capsule. <br>
NYSSA: He can't have done. If the Brigadier was still in the ship, he
never used the transmat system. <br>
TEGAN: The auto-destruct! We've got to get back to the ship. Come on! </font></p>

TURLOUGH: I'm not that easy to get rid of. <br>
TEGAN: So it seems. <br>
TURLOUGH: Doctor, may I join you? <br>
DOCTOR: I think you already have. <br>

eyes at each other and Mawdryn's ship goes KaBOOM! </font> </p>
