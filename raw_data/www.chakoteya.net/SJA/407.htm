CLYDE: Tea's up. What's going on? <br>
RANI: Mister S just picked up an alien energy trace, just for a second,
and then it vanished. <br>
SARAH JANE: Somewhere in all of that. <br>
CLYDE: And what is all of that? <br>
SARAH JANE: Transmissions from radio, TV, satellite. That's every
signal, every energy source on the planet. It's the sound of the Earth.
<br>
CLYDE: Bit noisy, aren't we? <br>
MR SMITH: I'm afraid I can't locate the energy trace, Sarah Jane. <br>
RANI: Okay, then what kind of alien energy is it? <br>
MR SMITH: I regret I do not have that information, Rani. <br>
SARAH JANE: Leave it to me. You've got school tomorrow morning. You go
home and get some sleep. <br>
CLYDE: I just made teas. <br>
SARAH JANE: Good, because this could be a late one. Come on, hop it. <br>
RANI: What if it's an invasion? <br>
CLYDE: So the world gets blown to smoky bits and we weren't there to
stop it because it was a school night? <br>
SARAH JANE: Go on, home. If I need you, I'll shout, don't you worry. <br>
(Clyde and Rani leave.) <br>
SARAH JANE: Keep scanning for that energy trace, Mister Smith. Let me
know the moment you locate the source. I hate not knowing.

around. Nobody. <br>
RANI: Sarah Jane's car's still there, but when I went to the attic, no

you. Of course I called you. I called you first. <br>

work after everything goes down. Still nothing. <br>

going to suddenly come back. <br>

nothing. <br>

Last night, the energy trace Mister Smith picked up. It must be
something to do with this. <br>
CLYDE: It's a bit of a coincidence if it's not. I'm so glad you're
here. <br>
RANI: Sarah Jane'd be more use to you. <br>
CLYDE: And better use to you than me. She'd be working things out,
calculating stuff. <br>
RANI: Hang on, your mum just disappeared? <br>
CLYDE: I didn't actually see it happen. She was saying something and
then she just suddenly stopped. I looked up and she wasn't there. <br>
RANI: Right, so, I mean, if everyone suddenly disappeared the same way,
just like that, well, then there should be cars crashed everywhere. <br>
CLYDE: Yeah, there should be planes falling out of the sky. We're right
near Heathrow, there's always tons of them circling about up there. <br>
RANI: There aren't any now. There are no cars in the middle of the
road. Just parked cars at the side. <br>
CLYDE: So it's like, when everyone went, whoever or whatever took them
also took all the planes and cars, all the moving vehicles. <br>

good? It's certainly weird. <br>

straight if I'm hungry. Do you want to get some breakfast, do something
normal?

What if there was a ray or something beamed at Earth
and we weren't affected but everyone else got blasted? <br>
CLYDE: What about the planes and the cars? It doesn't make sense. And
we're not going to panic. <br>
RANI: I wasn't panicking. <br>
CLYDE: You were. So was I. Like you said, we've got to do a Sarah Jane.
We've got to stop, think and work it out. <br>

everyone's gone except us. <br>
CLYDE: And animals. There are still animals. <br>
RANI: What's so different about us? <br>
CLYDE: And why's Sarah Jane gone? If anyone round here's different, I
reckon it's her. <br>
RANI: Yeah. Maybe they just want us. <br>
CLYDE: Or they don't want us. Hold on. Why are aliens more likely to
single us out more than anyone else? <br>
RANI: Duh. Because we know Sarah Jane. Thinking isn't getting us
anywhere, we're just going round in a big circle. <br>
CLYDE: Exactly, we need logic, we need brains, we need Luke. How long
will it take to get to Oxford? <br>
RANI: Hey, we're staying put. If he's around, he'll come down to us. <br>
CLYDE: But what if he's up in the quad thinking, maybe if I stay put
they'll come up to me? <br>

left in the whole wide world? <br>

We've lost it and we've lost Gavin. <br>
RANI: Weird alien noise, terrified kid and what do we do? Run to the
window and start talking all Star Trek. We must have looked really
normal. <br>
CLYDE: Is Gavin normal, though? <br>
RANI: What do you mean? <br>
CLYDE: Well, this morning, when I was alone, I thought I was the only
one left. It was horrible. If I'd seen anyone else, even if it was
Chris Moyles,
I would have run towards them, not away, like Gavin did. Wouldn't you? <br>
RANI: Yeah, But when you were that age, sixth form kids looked big and
scary. <br>
CLYDE: I'm not big and scary. And that flat, apart from one photo, was
there anything that said a kid lives here? No kids' DVDs lying around,
no photos of them with him. And his room, it was like a cell. No
computer games or anything. Isn't that weird? <br>
RANI: Then we should feel sorry for him, not start judging him. He
lives a really rubbish life, and what's our first reaction? Oh, maybe
he's an alien.
What are we? <br>
CLYDE: Are we sure he isn't? <br>
RANI: No. I don't know and neither do you. Just leave it. <br>
CLYDE: Oh, so you're in charge? <br>
RANI: Yeah, I think I probably should be. <br>
CLYDE: Well, I've known Sarah Jane longer than you&gt; I've got
more experience. <br>
RANI: What, so it's like the army now? We've all got ranks and you're
second in command, sir? <br>
CLYDE: Look, we need a plan of action.

pours himself a drink.) <br>
CLYDE: Right, from now on, if we get split up, we meet back here, yeah?
<br>
RANI: What, your headquarters, sir? Yes, sir. <br>
(Clyde puts money in the till.) <br>
CLYDE: Oh, look at me, honest Injun. Never would have done that before
Sarah Jane. Okay, I'm sorry. <br>
RANI: Biggest crisis ever and it's just us. Not the time traveller, not
the boy genius, not the supercomputer or the mega-dog. Us. <br>
CLYDE: Hey. We are vital team members. <br>
RANI: What, the two kids with no reason to be there? The hangers-on?
We're both just really nosey, so we got into Sarah Jane's life. <br>
CLYDE: She warned us off, gave us the choice to go back and forget it
all. <br>
RANI: Maybe she was right. Maybe today's the day it all comes back to
bite us on the bum. <br>
CLYDE: Do you think that if it wasn't for Sarah Jane and our thing that
we'd have been mates? <br>
RANI: I dunno. Maybe. Maybe not. It's not the usual way to grow up,
though, is it? Fighting aliens. Defending the Earth. <br>
CLYDE: Don't see much of my old gang any more. They're like, I met this
hottie in Whispers in Acton. What am I supposed to say? I was
fighting the Pied Piper of Hamelin? I love it, though. <br>
RANI: Yeah. With Sarah Jane, half the time I'm terrified and the other
half I'm really happy. <br>
CLYDE: I'm leaning towards terrified right now. <br>
RANI: None of this makes sense. If they're clever enough, if they're
powerful enough to magic, teleport away, everybody. <br>
CLYDE: If that is what they've done. <br>
RANI: Well, let's say it is. Let's say they've got rid of everyone so
they can invade, take over Earth for themselves. Then where are they?
And why haven't they come to get us? <br>
CLYDE: Don't tempt fate. I'm not like Sarah Jane, I believe in fate.
What if aliens have decided to start the human race again, just
beginning with you and me? <br>
RANI: Clyde, seriously, shut up. <br>
(An point downwards red triangle appears on the television screen. with
alien script across it.) <br>
RANI: What is that? <br>
(Clyde's phone bings.) <br>
CLYDE: It's on here too. <br>
RANI: Yeah, and mine. There it is again. <br>
CLYDE: Yeah, and a lot closer.

(They run over to a computer shop.) <br>
RANI: It's on every screen. What does it mean? <br>
CLYDE: It's got to be something to do with that noise. It's definitely
coming from up there somewhere. <br>
(As they cross the top of the alley behind Bonmarché, someone runs
across. Rani turns down it.) <br>
RANI: Gavin? Gavin! Gavin, is that you? <br>
(A red one-eyed robot comes up behind her. She tries to climb over a
metal fence. Meanwhile, a similar yellow robot comes up behind Clyde.) <br>
CLYDE: No. Don't, please.
