CLYDE: I won't worry about it. <br>
PAUL: So, how about you and me, we go away for a bit? <br>

PAUL: You don't need to call your mum. <br>
CLYDE: I don't need to call my mum. <br>

UNIT know about it. The pendant belongs to this race of creatures, the
Berserkers. <br>
LUKE: Aren't they from Norse mythology? <br>
MARIA: Still the brainbox, Luke. <br>
LUKE: The Berserkers were warriors who put on animal skins as armour. <br>
MARIA: And they were vicious, and mad and <br>
RANI: Berserk? <br>
ALAN: Exactly. Only according to UNIT, they're actually this old race
of superbad alien soldiers who, to build up their army, sent out loads
of these pendants. <br>
LUKE: How did one end up at the school? <br>
MARIA: The last sighting of it was at the Park Vale army barracks in
Ealing. In December, 1940, the base was destroyed by a German bomb. And
fifty years later, that's where they built the school. <br>
RANI: What does it actually do to you? <br>
MARIA: Every time you use it, it changes you. The Beserkers weren't
wearing animal skins, they were changing into something people at the
time couldn't recognise.
If Clyde's dad is using the pendant, he's turning into one of the
Berserkers. Luke, Clyde's in real danger. <br>
LUKE: Okay. Well, we'll deal with it. We'll find them. <br>
RANI: How? He won't tell us where he is. He doesn't know us any more. <br>
ALAN: I reckon I can help with that. Well, UNIT can. They've got a
satellite tracking system. All I need to do is put in Clyde's mobile
phone number. Got him!

CLYDE: I want to say bye to Dad first. <br>
PAUL: I'm sorry. <br>
(Under the picture of young Clyde, is an ultrasound scan of a foetus.) <br>
PAUL: Mel is pregnant. <br>
CLYDE: What? <br>
PAUL: That's why I ran away. I remembered what a useless dad I was to
you. <br>
CLYDE: But I needed you. <br>
PAUL: You're not a kid any more. You're cool. You don't need me. <br>
CLYDE: You're right. I don't need you. I've got Mum, Sarah Jane, Luke,
Rani, Maria. So I don't need you, but I think that baby does. Try not
to mess it up. And you can take the car back, the clothes, everything.
I'll go home with Mum. <br>
(Paul drives away. Carla goes to Clyde.) <br>
CARLA: So, what was that all about? <br>
CLYDE: It was just what I do. <br>
CARLA: It's dangerous. I tried so hard to keep you safe. Clyde, I can't
cope with this. <br>
CLYDE: And I want to keep you safe. I want you to be happy. Mum, forget
about the pendant, forget about the aliens, and forget about what I do.
<br>
(The pendant glows.) <br>
CARLA: Oh, flipping heck, it's cold. Where's your Dad? <br>
CLYDE: Dad's gone. <br>
CARLA: Sorry, Clyde. <br>
CLYDE: Me too. Let's go home. <br>
(Clyde throws the pendant into the water.)

SARAH: I know. <br>
CLYDE: I shouldn't have brought him here. <br>
SARAH: You wanted to impress your Dad. I'd probably have done the same.
<br>
CLYDE: Do you miss your Mum and Dad? <br>
SARAH: I can't really remember them. I was a baby when they died. Yes,
sometimes I think I'd do anything to see them again. Go on, tell me
what you're thinking. <br>
CLYDE: Sometimes, sometimes people think I'm not bothered by stuff.
That I'm always <br>
SARAH: Clyde, you don't have to be cool all the time. <br>
CLYDE: There's a lot of my Dad in me. I saw that today, and I think, I
think if it wasn't for you lot, I'd be weaker, like him. <br>
SARAH: And I think you underestimate yourself. Now go on, get home.
I'll see you tomorrow. <br>
CLYDE: Thank you. <br>
(Clyde leaves. Sarah Jane goes to a drawer and takes out an old
photograph of her parents from 1951.)
