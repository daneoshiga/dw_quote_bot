TRUEMAN: Mars will enter Capricorn on the seventeenth, but beware,
Mercury is moving retrograde through Scorpio, which can mean only one
thing.
A vital letter will be lost in the post. <br>
CHERYL: I'll look out for that. Can you see anything else? What if I do
go ahead and leave the carpet shop? Will I find another job? <br>
TRUEMAN: Yes. Saturn signifies a new occupation in communications. I
see a call centre. <br>
CHERYL: With better money? <br>
TRUEMAN: Jupiter, the planet of abundance, is traversing the fifth
house. There will be better money for all those born under the sign of
Gemini. <br>
CHERYL: Fantastic. Oh, for both of us. You're Gemini too, aren't you? <br>
TRUEMAN: Sign of the twins. Two faces. That's this session over,
Cheryl. <br>
CHERYL: Thanks. You're brilliant, Martin. My husband says I'm mad
coming to see you. He says none of your predictions come true.
Like when I was going to win that holiday, we were going to move to
Scotland. But I told him, the stars work in mysterious ways. <br>
TRUEMAN: They do indeed. <br>
CHERYL: I said, So what if we fall behind on the mortgage this month.
Martin is worth every penny. <br>
TRUEMAN: No, no, stop. Cheryl, I can't take your mortgage money. <br>
CHERYL: What? <br>
TRUEMAN: I'm a fraud. <br>
CHERYL: Say again? <br>
TRUEMAN: I won't take your money because I was just making it all up.
There's no power in the stars. Please, please. I can't take the money. <br>
CHERYL: I can't believe I'm hearing this. The stars guide everything we
do. <br>
TRUEMAN: Do you think anything up there has any influence down here, on
you and me? Do you really believe there is such a thing as destiny? <br>
(A fireball streaks through space.) <br>
TRUEMAN: If only there was. When I was a kid, I was convinced I was
going to do great things. It was fate. But I failed in everything I
tried, all my life.
And I end up like this, a con artist. <br>
(He stands at the window, and what looked like a fireball whizzes
straight into him.) <br>
CHERYL: What was that? Martin? Mister Trueman? You all right? <br>
TRUEMAN: At last. <br>
CHERYL: What just happened there? <br>
TRUEMAN: Gemini, you are going on a long journey. A very long journey. <br>
(Trueman puts his hand on her head, and red energy sizzles. She
screams.)

RANI: Lazy, shallow. <br>

RANI: How about you, then, Luke? <br>
LUKE: Astrology has no scientific basis. It's based on primitive
observations and a fundamental misunderstanding of the way the universe
works. <br>
RANI: Thanks for that, but I meant what's your sign? When's your
birthday? <br>
LUKE: I don't have one. <br>

SARAH JANE: It's nice to spend time with some adults for a change. This

<br>
CHERYL: I've made my decision, Stuart. I'm staying with Mister Trueman.
<br>
STUART: He's done something to you. I can see it, Cheryl. It's in your

CHERYL: Typical Scorpio. Jealous and obsessive. I'm the same as I have
always been. <br>
STUART: I'm not leaving here without you. <br>

STUART: Maybe it's me that should be calling them. Something's wrong

until suddenly I felt the power of the stars. <br>
GITA: Oh. Sarah, Rani. Over here. <br>
SARAH JANE: Sarah Jane. My name's Sarah Jane. <br>
GITA: That's what I said. <br>

CLYDE: No. Never sit in the middle seat, or you're trapped. <br>
(Fanfare.) <br>
CHERYL: From the dawn of time, man has looked up to the stars for
guidance. Tonight, the secrets of the stars will be revealed to you.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mister Martin Trueman. <br>
TRUEMAN: Thank you, thank you. How nice to see you all. Welcome,
welcome. Oh. Thank you for coming. Ladies, a couple of Golden Girls
here. <br>
LUKE: He's a bit milky, isn't he? <br>
CLYDE: Cheesy. For the hundredth time, the word is cheesy. <br>
TRUEMAN: Young man, welcome. Welcome, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight I'd like to share my journey with you.
I was a nothing, a nobody, until I learned the secrets of the stars. In
some ways, I feel as if I was chosen. There is so much more in the
universe than what we can see from here on Earth. There are two hundred
billion stars in our galaxy alone.
Huge, shifting stellar forces, pulsing with ancient light. You didn't
come here for a science lesson, did you? No. So let's try a bit of
showbiz, shall we? Now, who in the audience tonight was born on May the
twenty ninth? <br>
(A woman stands up.) <br>
TRUEMAN: What about June the sixteenth? How about June the fifth? <br>
(Clyde stands.) <br>
CLYDE: What did I do that for? <br>
TRUEMAN: Down. Down. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. That's enough, thank
you. Down. <br>
(Clyde and the women finally sit.) <br>
CLYDE: Oh, no, no. <br>
TRUEMAN: A round of applause, please, for my three accomplices. <br>
CLYDE: How did he do that? <br>
SARAH JANE: The power of suggestion. It's simple stuff. A parlour
trick. <br>
CLYDE: Nobody ever mentions that again, okay? <br>
RANI: Don't worry, you were really funny. <br>
CLYDE: I choose when I'm funny. Not him. <br>
TRUEMAN: Now, on your way in tonight you put your birth date in the
mystery box in the foyer. My assistant, the lovely Cheryl, has printed
up your birth charts. Thank you, Cheryl. So if we're ready, we'll
begin, shall we?
I'm looking for a Diane Cope. <br>
DIANE: That's me. <br>
TRUEMAN: Diane, your Pisces moon indicates a love of learning. I think
perhaps you've just gone back to college? <br>
DIANE: Yes, that's true. <br>
SARAH JANE: She's a plant. <br>
LUKE: A vegetable life form? <br>
SARAH JANE: It means he knows her. He's planted her in the audience. <br>
TRUEMAN: Believe me, you've done the right thing. Mercury in Virgo. I
think you're studying history and sociology. <br>
RANI: She looks genuine to me. <br>
DIANE: Yes. <br>
TRUEMAN: So let's try somebody else, shall we? Where's Rani Chandra? <br>
GITRA: Oh, wow. Here she is. <br>
TRUEMAN: Rani, now please would you confirm that you and I have never
met before? <br>
RANI: No, we've never met before. <br>
TRUEMAN: Thank you. Now, in your chart, Rani, Mercury is in conjunction
with Neptune. Am I right in thinking that you've just moved house? <br>
RANI: Yes. You're right. <br>
TRUEMAN: In fact, your whole life is changing. You suddenly see the
world in a new light. It's exciting, and you love it. <br>
RANI: Yes. Incredible. <br>
TRUEMAN: And there is an anchoring influence in your life is
represented by Saturn. A Taurus man, someone very calm and reliable? Is
it your dad? A teacher? <br>
GITA: It's my husband. He's here. <br>
TRUEMAN: And there's Mum, a Gemini, of course. Thank you, Rani. Now I'm
being strangely drawn to a Sarah Jane Smith. <br>
SARAH JANE: That's me. <br>
TRUEMAN: Ah, Taurus. Strong, determined. Now you were born under a very
special star, Neptune in your fifth house.
Some years ago you travelled far and wide and oh, the things you have
seen. And there was a man. A very special man. No, no. Let me think.
It wasn't a romance. No, no, it was something much, much more than
that. He taught you so much. There was laughter and adventure,
and you prayed that your time with him would never, never end. But
then, suddenly, he left you. <br>
GITA: I knew there was a bloke somewhere. What did I say? Broken heart.
<br>
TRUEMAN: A man with no name. <br>
HARISH: He's upsetting her. <br>
TRUEMAN: A scientist? No. A doctor. The Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR 10 [memory]: Hello, Sarah Jane. <br>
SARAH [memory]: Doctor. It's you, isn't it? <br>
TRUEMAN: Am I right? <br>
SARAH JANE: Yes, you're right. But you tell me right now, how do you
know that? <br>
TRUEMAN: It's all in your stars. And there's Jupiter in your twelth
house. You are the keeper of secrets. <br>
SARAH JANE: If you're so clever, tell me about the future. <br>
TRUEMAN: If you want, but oh, I'm afraid Saturn is transiting Taurus.
You have fought many battles in your life. You're about to fight
another.
But this time it will be different. This time, Sarah Jane, you lose. </font></font></p>

SARAH JANE: Mister Smith, I want you to scan the area around the New
Theatre, East Acton. Look for anything unusual or alien. <br>
CLYDE: Psychic energy, yeah? We know that's real. You almost brought
the moon crashing down with your almighty brain. <br>
SARAH JANE: No. That is not what Trueman is about. He can see into
people's lives, see into their destinies. <br>
CLYDE: Yeah, by mind-reading. <br>
LUKE: No, by calculating the positions of the stars when they were
born, which is impossible. <br>
MR SMITH: Sarah Jane, scan completed. I have detected no irregularities
in the vicinity. <br>
SARAH JANE: No, there must be something. An atmospheric disturbance, an
energy spike. <br>
MR SMITH: There has been no such event. <br>
CLYDE: What if it's real? How could we detect it? We don't even believe
in it. <br>

the zodiac of Draconia. <br>

LUKE: Mum? What's happened? <br>
RANI: We nearly got zapped by Trueman. <br>
SRAH: We need to find out where he gets his zapping power. <br>
RANI: He said Ancient Lights, whatever it means. Mister Smith, analyse
the damage to this fabric. What caused it? <br>
MR SMITH: The fabric has been burnt. <br>
RANI: By what? <br>
MR SMITH: By nothing. <br>
LUKE: That doesn't make any sense. <br>
MR SMITH: Nothing has burnt the fabric. <br>
SARAH JANE: But it's been burnt. <br>
LUKE: By something Mister Smith can't detect. <br>
RANI: Like Clyde said, how can we detect something we don't believe in?
The power of the Ancient Lights. What if it is astrology? What if
astrology is true? <br>
SARAH JANE: It can't be true. <br>
LUKE: It's completely contrary to the laws of physics. <br>

Whoa. How did I get here? <br>
TRUEMAN: I made you want to come here. You are one of the lucky ones.
It's your destiny. <br>

CLYDE: Here, give that back. <br>
TRUEMAN: Down. Not today, thank you. <br>
CLYDE: What are you going to do to me? <br>
TRUEMAN: There's nothing to be afraid of. You have been chosen to join
my inner circle. Life is going to be far less complicated for you.
Accept the Ancient Lights. <br>

No answer. It must be on silent. <br>
LUKE: He never puts it on silent, not even in school. He's probably
just got his headphones on. <br>
SARAH JANE: So, this energy. We saw it. It exists. <br>
RANI: Hang on. Astrology breaks the laws of physics. <br>
LUKE: What are you getting at? <br>
RANI: Well, what if the Ancient Lights come from somewhere else? A
place where the laws of physics are different, so they can break ours? <br>
LUKE: That's like saying you could break the law of gravity. <br>
RANI: But maybe that's why Mister Smith said nothing burnt my jacket.
What if this energy the Ancient Lights use is a different kind of
energy to anything we know? <br>
SARAH JANE: No, Rani. The laws of physics, they're are the same across
the universe. <br>
LUKE: Our universe. But what if the Ancient Lights are from another
one? </font></font></p>

Mister Smith said every galaxy has its own form of astrology, not just
Earth. What if astrology is a kind of memory of a time before? <br>
RANI: Explain. <br>
LUKE: Thirteen billion years ago, the universe was created. A massive
explosion, the Big Bang. But what was there before? <br>
SARAH JANE: Nobody knows. <br>
LUKE: What if there was another universe? <br>
RANI: Where the physics were different. Where astrology worked. <br>
SARAH JANE: And this energy somehow survived the Big Bang. <br>
RANI: The Ancient Lights. So they're very ancient. What have they done
the last thirteen billion years? <br>
SARAH JANE: And why have they picked Trueman? <br>
MR SMITH: May I make a suggestion? <br>
SARAH JANE: Go ahead, Mister Smith. <br>
MR SMITH: If Luke's theory is correct, the energy form has been waiting
for exactly the right astrological conditions across the universe.
Trueman's birth chart is a vital part of that equation. He is the
channel the energy needs. <br>
LUKE: Needs him for what, though? What does it want? <br>
RANI: Yeah, it can't have waited that long just to appear on a stage in
Acton. <br>
MR SMITH: Sarah Jane, my media sensor reports that Martin Trueman is
about to appear live on the television. Shall I relay the image? <br>
SARAH JANE: Yes, please. <br>
LISA [on screen]: We're here at the New Theatre in East Acton, where
astrologer Martin Trueman has been creating a buzz with some amazing
live shows.
