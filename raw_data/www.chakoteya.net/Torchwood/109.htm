[OC]: The speed of light is 299,792,458 metres per second. Pain travels
through the body at 350 feet per second. Even a sneeze can reach
100 miles per hour. And as for life, well, that just bloody whizzes by.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(A man is lying face up in the middle of the
tarmac. He looks quite peaceful. Then he opens his eyes, looks around
and frowns.) <br>
EUGENE [OC]: So then, this is me, Eugene Jones. <br>
(He gets up and walks past the black Range Rover, then under the police
tape towards the ambulance and police cars. There is a body lying face
down on the grass verge.) <br>
EUGENE: Hey, Gwen. Jack. Er, Tosh. The guys at the rope just let me
through so <br>
GWEN: I'd say at least fifty miles per hour. <br>
JACK: Travelled on the bonnet, bounced, maybe rolled, smashed his face
on the road. <br>
EUGENE: Hey? Er, excuse me, but that looks a lot like me. <br>
(It does, apart from the blood.) <br>
TOSH: He couldn't even cross the road without messing it up. <br>
GWEN: No bag, nothing. I mean, what was he doing here? Perhaps he was
hit deliberately? Maybe he really did have something important. <br>
TOSH: Like what? <br>
GWEN: I don't know. He was always trying to talk to us, show us stuff.
Perhaps we shouldn't have been so <br>
TOSH: Gwen, I think it's just an ordinary RTA. <br>
EUGENE: Guys? <br>
JACK: It was a red car. There's red paint under his fingernails. <br>
EUGENE: Am I dead? <br>
(He puts his arm through Tosh.) <br>
EUGENE: Am I dead? Am I dead? <br>
(A mobile phone rings in the grass. Tosh picks it up.) <br>
TOSH: Yes? <br>
BRONWEN [OC]: Hello, love. I've just been to the shops and forgot
tea-bags. <br>
(Tosh hands the phone to Gwen.) <br>
BRONWEN [OC]: Hello? Eugene? <br>
GWEN: Hi, Mrs Jones. Something's happened. We need to talk to you. <br>
EUGENE [OC]: What happened? How did I end up here? I mean, I'm dead?
But I'm not dead. So, shit! So, what? Am I a ghost or a zombie?
Oh, God. Right, calm. Yeah? Stick with the team. <br>
JACK: Gwen? <br>
GWEN: What? You're driving. <br>
EUGENE [OC]: This is Torchwood, it's going to be okay. </font></p>

see his reflection in the rear view mirror.) <br>
EUGENE: Oh, what? Of course, I'm invisible. Why am I invisible? <br>
JACK: Anything on his phone from today? <br>
GWEN: Just some pictures of random shoes. <br>
EUGENE: Mind you, it feels kind of familiar. You know what? Whatever's
happened, all of a sudden, I'm somewhere I've always wanted to be.
Let's back up a bit. I mean, every story's got a beginning. I think
mine began here.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[School]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EUGENE [OC]: The final of the Interschool Maths
Competition, 1992. I used to be a maths head. Binary coding, topology,
quadratics, I loved stuff like that.
And I'm supposed to be really good at it. <br>
QUESTION MASTER [OC]: Thirty four, and Rushmore a mountainous forty
two. So we congratulate the winning team, Rushmore. <br>
EUGENE [OC]: Dad took the day off work to come and see me, but when the
moment mattered, I blanked, let the side down, made a mess of it.
Everyone blamed me for losing the final, but it must have been what
happened afterwards that started this whole thing off. <br>
(His father had been filming the contest. Young Eugene is brooding in
the science lab. A teacher comes in.) <br>
GARRET: Have you ever had a proper look at the collection? <br>
EUGENE: No, sir. <br>
GARRET: Would you like to? <br>
EUGENE: No, sir. <br>
GARRET: I play golf. <br>
EUGENE: Oh. Good, sir. <br>
GARRET: I play golf, and one day when I was playing really badly, I was
stuck in the first bunker whacking away at all the sand, and this fell
out of the sky. <br>
(He takes a small round object from a display case of fossils and
stuff.) <br>
GARRET: And landed, plop, beside me. <br>
EUGENE: From the sky? <br>
GARRET: Yeah. It looks a bit like a golf ball, so I picked it up and
put it in my pocket. But when I had a proper look later. Here. <br>
(He hands it to Eugene.) <br>
GARRET: I realised it was an eye. And I thought, well, Where could that
have come from? It fell from the sky. Isn't that amazing? Have it. <br>
(As young Eugene looks into the Eye, something inside moved. Then his
Dad bursts in.) <br>
SHAUN: Where the bloody hell have you been? <br>
GARRET: Good evening. <br>
SHAUN: Good evening. Come on, Eugene. <br>
GARRET: Have you got everything? <br>
EUGENE: Yes. Thanks, sir.
</font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Eugene contemplates the Eye whilst his parents
argue.) <br>
SHAUN: I went to the school, didn't I! <br>
EUGENE [OC]: Dad was mad at me for losing the final. But now I had the
Eye. And what I realised was, if it fell from the sky, it probably, '
no, no, it almost certainly belonged to an alien. <br>
(The argument is continuing whilst Eugene is in bed.) <br>
SHAUN [OC]: I'm off! <br>
(Slam! The back ground music starts up - Starman by David Bowie. Eugene
knocks on his bedroom window as his father gets into the car.) <br>
EUGENE [OC]: That was the night Dad went away. But it was okay, because
I had the Eye, and the possibility of an alien encounter.
I mean, if you leave something really important behind, you come back
and get it. Don't you? God, I wanted that alien to come back and claim
his Eye more than I wanted anything in my life. I worked out the
possible provenance, the life form and galaxy, planetary escape
velocities, launch windows, necessary fuel capacities. And then, I
waited. <br>
BOWIE: There's a Starman waiting in the sky He'd like to come and meet
us but he thinks he'll blow our minds. There's a Starman
waiting in the sky He's told us not to blow it <br>
EUGENE [OC]: My dad never came back. As I got older, I became
interested in UFOs, collected alien artefacts, watched the stars and
waited alone for my alien.
And then, I found you, Gwen Cooper.

EUGENE: Hi, I'm Eugene Jones and, er, I have a keen interest in your
work and, er, I've got something to. I'd just like to show <br>

Principle.) <br>

GWEN: Oh, hang on, there's something missing here. Mrs Jones, do you
know what's missing from Eugene's collection? <br>

investigation like this <br>
(Eugene faints, and Gwen looks around.) <br>
IANTO: Okay, a red Vauxhall has been stopped outside Caernarfon. A very
drunk guy has admitted knocking a man over near Cardiff. Fit's Eugene's
description.
The man says he thought he'd be okay, so he drove on. <br>
OWEN: Ah, he was a sweet guy. That's very sad. Now, can we get on with
some proper work, please? <br>
(Later, Eugene recovers to the sound of Antony and the Johnsons singing
Hope There's Someone.) <br>

go? Hope there's someone who'll set my heart free. Nice to hold when
I'm tired. There's a ghost on the horizon. When I go to bed how can I
fall asleep at night? How will I rest my head? I'm scared of the middle

OWEN: Marvellous. Thank you for that Disney moment. Now, who's making
the tea? <br>
GWEN: I suppose Eugene's a bit odd. and a real local and amateur for
you. <br>
OWEN: And why is it that only Gwen seems to have a heart? I don't know
if you've noticed but the rest of us are human, and amazingly we still

know what I'm sayin'? You see, no disrespect, but Eugene had loser
written through him like Brighton in a stick of rock. Maybe he just
couldn't live with his failure.
You wanna write the cheque? <br>
EUGENE [OC]: Failure? Is that right? Has my life just been one big
failure? I mean, maybe I never quite lived up to my early promises of
maths genius,
but that's because I was waiting for the alien to collect his Eye and
change my life. And while I was waiting, I joined Passmore Telesales.

prize? <br>
BRONWEN: Yeah, it was that Mister Garrett, the science teacher. A
plastic eye, as a consolation prize. Still, Eugene treasured it. <br>
TERRY: That was the night Dad walked out. <br>
BRONWEN: Went away. <br>
TERRY: You can stop now, Mum. <br>
BRONWEN: What do you mean? <br>
TERRY: He's dead. He may have been able to square the root of the

BRONWEN: Terry, please! <br>
GWEN: He sold the Eye online. So something must have happened. <br>
TERRY: Dad left when he found out Eugene was a failure. That's what
Eugene always said. <br>
BRONWEN: That's not true. None of that's true. He went cos of his job.
He has a very important job. <br>
GWEN: Does Mister Jones know about Eugene? <br>
BRONWEN: Well, you see, he works for a big corporation in America. <br>
TERRY: Stop giving us that shit. He's not Superman, Mum! He works at a
garage on Filey Road. Eugene found him about two weeks ago. He found
him on the internet.
He's a cashier, works nights. <br>

EUGENE [OC]: All those years I'd believed my dad had gone to America
because I was a failure. And here he was, all along, doing his
important secret
work in Filey Road, Cardiff. When I found him, I couldn't even bear to
say hello. I'd spent my life believing in stupid stories, fantasies.
I've wasted my life. Once I'd seen him there, everything I'd dreamed
about was like rubbish, it was just a crock of shit, including the Eye.
So why not sell it? Along with the woodworm treatment and loft
insulation, and all the other crap floating round the world. Linda was
welcome to the money. <br>

needs a bit of help. <br>
JACK: To do what? He's dead. <br>
GWEN: Yes, Jack, I know he's dead, but <br>
EUGENE: This is not sounding good, Gwen. <br>
JACK: I've got work to do. <br>
GWEN: Okay. <br>
EUGENE: Eh? No. You can't just stop. I mean, what about the fifteen

GWEN: Okay, listen to this. Eugene had an alien Eye in his collection.
He sold it online. <br>
JACK: What, like a sixth eye? A Dogon sixth eye? <br>
GWEN: Maybe. <br>
JACK: It's possible. There was a trade in them. Who's got it? <br>
GWEN: I don't know, but I've nearly tracked it down. What exactly is a
sixth eye? I mean, exactly? <br>
JACK: It's one in the back. Let's you see behind you, where you've
been. Kind of puts things in perspective. It's useful, fun, slightly
terrifying. That's why they were in demand. <br>

GWEN: I thought it was fifteen thousand and five pound fifty. <br>

cup of coffee. He was scared. <br>

thought, well, that's funny, innit?
Come on, Eugene, get real. But then we thought, let him dream, man.
Life's short and really boring. So then we went on betting and then <br>
EUGENE: You bid fifteen thousand for the Eye? <br>
JOSH: Not us, no, no way. It turns out there was real interest. <br>

JOSH: Eugene, man. I'm as partial as the next guy to a bit of sci-fi
but, what, a green geezer with six eyes? Get real, guy.
