<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Night. A noise wakes the woman up.) <br>
BETH: Mike, did you hear that? <br>
MIKE: Someone's in the living room. <br>
(He puts the light on to reveal they are a mixed race couple.) <br>
BETH: Are you gonna go in there? <br>
MIKE: Are you? <br>
(He gets a cricket bat from underneath the bed whist she takes the
phone and starts dialling.) <br>
OPERATOR [OC]: Emergency. Which service, please? <br>
BETH: Police. <br>
MIKE: Who's there? <br>
BETH: My name's Beth Halloran, I'm at 114 Brodsky Gardens. I think
there's a burglar in the flat. Come quickly. <br>
(There is a thump and a squeal. A figure in black drags Mike back into
the bedroom.) <br>
BURGLAR: Come on, then. Get back in there. <br>
BETH: Mike. <br>
BURGLAR: Sit down there. <br>
BETH: There's two of them. My husband's been injured. Send an
ambulance. <br>
BURGLAR 2: I'll get the TV stuff unhooked. <br>
BETH: Wait, just take whatever you want. <br>
BURGLAR: Keep her quiet. <br>
BURGLAR 2: Wait, wait. Do you hear that? <br>
OPERATOR [OC]: Beth, are there any other exits you can take? Beth, can
you hear me? <br>
BURGLAR 2L What's happening? <br>
BURGLAR: Get away. What is that thing? No, please, don't. Don't. Please
stop. Stop. I'm sorry! <br>
BURGLAR 2: What's going on? <br>
BURGLAR: I'm sorry. No! Get away! No!

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JACK: Tosh, what happened here? <br>
TOSH: Two IC one males, one fatality, one seriously wounded after a
fall from a fifth floor window onto a police vehicle. <br>
(Owen goes to the burglar who is still on the car roof, still wearing
his balaclava.) <br>
OWEN: Bloody hell. Here you are, has he been stabilised? <br>
JACK: Gwen, Owen, go with him to the hospital, see if he says anything.
Interview the husband and wife while you're there. Tosh, with me.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POLICEMAN: Bit weird, this one. Might be one of
yours. Nobody saw anything, heard anything, blah, blah, blah. The
usual.
Don't know why we bother asking anymore. <br>
JACK: Thanks so much. We'll take it from here. If you could just wait
outside. <br>
POLICEMAN: In my opinion, the husband did it. He was looking for
trouble, expecting to be burgled. <br>
JACK: Really. <br>
POLICEMAN: Yeah. Look. No other reason I can think of for keeping
sports equipment in the bedroom. <br>
JACK: 0h, you should come round to my house for a game of hockey
sometime. <br>
(The policeman leaves.) <br>
TOSH: Making friends? <br>
JACK: Not really. What have you got? <br>
TOSH: Well, no glass inside, so it was definitely broken out. <br>
JACK: Police say the stab wounds were caused by some sort of long,
narrow blade, which that isn't. <br>
(The bloody cricket bat.) <br>
JACK: No other weapons in the room could have done this, so how the
hell did they manage it? <br>
TOSH: Husband was unconscious, and the wife probably weighs less than I
do. I can't see either of them doing this. <br>
JACK: When you fear for your life, you'd be surprised what you can do.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BETH: I didn't see anything. We all heard this
weird noise, then the next thing I know, I'm in the corner and he's
just sitting there, dead.
The other one was just gone. <br>
GWEN: And then what? <br>
BETH: Nothing. I just stayed there till the police arrived. I couldn't
move. I should have checked on Mike. <br>
MIKE: Don't be silly. You did the right thing. I'm fine. <br>
BETH: Be quiet, you. The doctor said you should rest. <br>
MIKE: I don't think the doctor meant my mouth. <br>
BETH: Actually, he did. He was very specific. He said no talking for a
whole week. <br>
MIKE: Lies, lies. Why so many lies?. <br>
GWEN: Okay, thanks for your time. We'll let you get some rest now.

absolutely terrifying. <br>
OWEN: It's always the one you least suspect. They're all in a room
together. Hubby's out cold, and she survives while two burglars get
mangled? She did it, she must have. <br>
GWEN: How? <br>
OWEN: I haven't worked that bit out yet. <br>
GWEN: Ah, I see, I see. <br>
OWEN: All right then, Jessica Fletcher, who done it? <br>
GWEN: The husband. His wife's in danger, he keeps a cricket bat under
the bed. You fill in the blanks from there. <br>
OWEN: Right, okay. So he kills one man, wearing gloves, and then he
swallows the murder weapon and the gloves and then he knocks himself
out? <br>
GWEN: Something like that, yeah. <br>
OWEN: Right. To be continued. <br>
(Owen answers his comms.) <br>
OWEN: Yeah? <br>
JACK [OC]: It's me. Anything? <br>
OWEN: No, nothing. They're completely clear.

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JACK: Well, one of them did it, we just need to
figure out how. Stay with the burglar all night if you have to. Keep an
eye on those two. <br>

with the burglar and find out if he knows anything, all night if you
have to. I know. And keep an eye on the other two. <br>
GWEN: Brilliant. Brilliant. Oh, will you get me a coffee before you go?
<br>
OWEN: Yeah, yeah, of course. What are team mates for? Er, you haven't
got a pound for the machine, have you? <br>
(A light goes out.) <br>
OWEN: Hospitals. They have to fall apart before anyone fixes them. <br>
GWEN: Pound. Coffee. <br>

off, dropping her empty coffee cup. The burglar wakes up.) <br>
GWEN: Oh, shush. Okay, you're safe now, all right? You're safe. Just
tell me who did this to you. <br>
(His heart starts racing.) <br>
BURGLAR: The woman in the flat. Keep her away from me. <br>

him lying him down.

BETH: Where am I? Where's my husband? <br>
JACK: He's safe. <br>
BETH: What do you mean, safe? What have you done with him? <br>
JACK: Nothing yet. Tell me what happened in the flat, Beth. It had to
be you or Mike, so how did you do it? <br>
BETH: You can't treat people like this. I've been burgled, attacked. I
want a lawyer, I want a phone call. If you're charging me with
something <br>
JACK: We're not charging you with anything. We don't have to. And
there'll be no lawyer, no phone calls. Just us and this room for as
long as it takes. Now, tell me what happened! <br>
BETH: I told her and the police. Please, I don't know anything. <br>
(They put crime scene photos of the dead burglar on the table.) <br>
JACK: Look at them. The second one just died in hospital. Keep her away
from me. The woman in the flat. Those were his dying words. Now why
would he say something like that? <br>
BETH: I don't know, I swear. I never touched him. <br>
JACK: Is it Mike? Are you covering for him? <br>
BETH: No! <br>
(The light bulb blows.) <br>
GWEN: Jack. <br>
(Jack leaves.) <br>
GWEN: Beth, we know these men attacked you and your husband. Now, if
you fought back, people will understand it was self-defence. <br>
BETH: I promise. I promise I have no idea what happened to them. All I
know is that it wasn't me.

IANTO: Oh, it passed. <br>
JACK: Tosh, anything on the body scan? <br>
TOSH: Nothing out of the ordinary. <br>
JACK: What about the light? Power surge? <br>
TOSH: Nothing from us. There was an electromagnetic buildup around her,
but I can't see how she caused it. <br>
OWEN: Same thing happened at the hospital, Jack. Can't be a
coincidence. <br>
JACK: It's her. I know it is. Okay, let's do some tests, see who or

GWEN: Just little things to clear this all up. Blood samples <br>
BETH: Blood samples? I haven't done anything. <br>
GWEN: Look. I believe you, but this is our job. Something really
strange happened at your flat and we've
got to make sure you had nothing to do with it. <br>
BETH: I didn't. <br>
GWEN: Then you've nothing to worry about. They are doing these tests
whether you like it or not. Don't make this any harder on yourself.

Nothing to worry about, just a little needle. <br>

OWEN: Needle's snapped. <br>
BETH: Haven't you got a nurse to do this? <br>
GWEN: He's a doctor. It's okay. <br>
(And a second needle breaks when Owen tries to break her skin.) <br>
BETH: Okay, look, I'm not gonna do this if you can't even <br>

OWEN: Bear with me. <br>
BETH: Hey, hey! <br>
(The blade breaks.) <br>
OWEN: When was the last time you were in hospital, Beth? <br>
BETH: I don't remember. I don't think I ever have. Why, what's wrong
with me? <br>
OWEN: Well, any operations? Checkups? <br>
BETH: No, nothing. <br>
OWEN: When was the last time you felt ill? Have you had a cold? <br>
BETH: I don't think I ever have. I take a lot of vitamin C. <br>
OWEN: Hmm. Hell of a lot, I reckon. <br>
JACK: Okay, Beth. You make light bulbs blow, we can't break your skin.
What planet are you from? <br>

anything hidden, it'll pop to the surface. <br>

saw the implant. <br>
OWEN: A sleeper agent? Who for? <br>
JACK: No one knows very much. They don't leave survivors. Official
designation is Cell 114. They infiltrate planets, adapting their
bodies, gathering intelligence, sometimes for years, watching, until
they're ready to take over. <br>
GWEN: Okay, that's creepy. <br>
JACK: If we're lucky, she's the first. They send an advance guard to
gather intel, given false memories so they blend in. She has no idea
she's not human.
Her real self must have taken over briefly, killed the burglars. Self
preservation. <br>
OWEN: Told you she did it. <br>
JACK: Yeah. The point is, by the time they attack they know every
single thing about the planet. Tosh. <br>
TOSH: The implant gathers information. Normal X-rays don't show it.
She's projecting a false image. It's got all this data stored inside
it.
This is a forcefield generator. It creates an impervious layer above
the skin, just a nanometre thick. That's why you couldn't get the
needle inside her. <br>
OWEN: Right, well. God, look. They even know about us. <br>
