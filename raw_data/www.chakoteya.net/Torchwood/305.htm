<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GWEN: There's one thing I always meant to ask Jack.
Back in the old days, I wanted to know about that Doctor of his.
The man who appears out of nowhere and saves the world. Except
sometimes he doesn't. All those times in history when there was no sign
of him,
I wanted to know why not. But I don't need to ask any more. I know the
answer now. Sometimes the Doctor must look at this planet and turn away
in shame.
I'm recording this in case anyone ever finds it, so you can see. You
can see how the world ended.

GREEN [on TV]: Today, we're taking steps to safeguard your children.
The schools are being opened again, and we urge all of you
to send your children back to their classes straight away. Government
representatives will be visiting certain schools to discuss a series of
inoculations. <br>
DAVID: What's inoculations? <br>
RHIANNON: Injections. <br>
DAVID: I don't want to go to school. <br>
RHIANNON: You're not going, either. You're staying put, just like your
Uncle Ianto said. Don't trust any of them. <br>
MICA: But the man said we got to go. <br>
RHIANNON: And I know for a fact he's lying. <br>
GREEN [on TV]: These inoculations are to protect your children. These
inoculations are safe. These inoculations will guarantee no repeat of
the problems
of the past four days. <br>
RHIANNON: David, on your feet. Go to the Baxters opposite, then go to
Sally's, then go to Mrs Singh. Tell 'em we'll have the kids, only free
of charge. <br>
JOHNNY: It's ten quid a kid. <br>
RHIANNON: Shut it, you. And run. Tell them my brother works for the
government. He said it's not safe. <br>

BRIDGET: Thank you. I've come to tell you how we met. <br>
LOIS: Who? <br>
BRIDGET: How I met John Frobisher. It was thirty years ago. You weren't
even born. I was on attachment to the Civil Service, only for six
months.
And just down the corridor, there he was. You wouldn't think it to look
at him now, but he was a clumsy thing. Always losing his key. Mister
Swales never thought he'd amount to much, but I thought, well, keep an
eye on that one. And all the others came and went. The high flyers,
they burnt out or went on to something better. And do you know what
John Frobisher did? He kept working. Head down, worked hard, all his
life. It was another ten years before we actually worked in the same
office. He asked for me. I didn't think he even knew my name. And we
made quite the team. I'm not saying he was perfect. You know that
better than me. But he worked hard. He always worked hard. I don't
think that's valued enough these days, hard work. And he was a good
man. I want you to know that. John Frobisher was a good man. Because
when the history of this is written, they'll talk about the ministers,
and the soldiers, and the things with numbers for names, and I think
people will forget how very good he was.
I want you to remember him like that. If ever you think of John
Frobisher, just remember that it wasn't his fault. <br>
(Frobisher goes upstairs to Lilly's bedroom where his wife and
daughters are waiting for him, with the gun that Bridget got for him
