home from work early and I knew there was something wrong. I could hear
voices from the kitchen. So I looked through the door and I could see
him crying. It turns out money had gone missing from work and he'd got
the blame. So I went to get all my pocket money and I put it in his
hand. It must've been about £2.50. And he looked at me and he said,
it's not about the money. He said, I can't stand anyone thinking I'm
not an honest man. And I will always remember that. Always. Because
that was the first time in my life anybody had spoken to me like an
adult. And then we went to the back garden
and we played till dark. So that's my dad, Geraint Wyn Cooper, the
nicest man in the world. And today's the day that I kill him.

deviation, because the Earth's not a perfect sphere.
Are you getting all this? <br>
(Jilly is recording it on her phone.) <br>
JILLY: Oh, yes. Every word. If that runs right through the centre of
the Earth, why isn't this thing a volcano? <br>
MOTHER: Again, no idea. Isn't that wonderful? The laws of The Blessing
are beyond us. That's why it took us so long to work out what it can
do. <br>
JILLY: How did you even find it? <br>
MOTHER: Well, we had to wait until the world grew up, until the
information age became fast enough so we could crunch the numbers on a
massive scale. Facts became visible that were never visible before,
such as a tiny little statistic hidden in the heart of Shanghai Old
Town. The average life expectancy of those living within a two mile
radius of this point was exactly equal to the average life expectancy
of the world, and it always had been. Say in 1998, the average life
expectancy from birth on this planet was
sixty six years, five months and thirty three days. In this area in
Shanghai, it was sixty six years, five months and thirty three days
exactly. Try going back a hundred years to 1898. The average life
expectancy was forty nine years, nine months and five days. Shanghai,
forty
nine years, nine months, five days.
It was as if something on this spot was calibrating a matrix,
subsisting alongside humankind in harmony. <br>
JILLY: But the Chinese didn't know about it. <br>
MOTHER: We paid them to look the other way. <br>
JILLY: It does make you seem kind of colonial. <br>
MOTHER: Well, is that such a bad word? Besides, we changed the whole of
the world, and this is just phase one.

we've been tracking contract intensive money since 1980. The

SHAPIRO: What, in the middle of all this? It's not tested. I mean, it
could bring down the whole system. I want that line passed through
every single intel division. <br>
CHARLOTTE: Hey. So, what's the trace? <br>
NOAH: Er, it's new software from the DIA. So, the three Families, they
use that vine technology to piggyback their calls on fifty thousand
different lines.
But the trace runs backwards, so it detects vine activity and then
follows it back to the source. If there's a mole working in this

sends her love. Mary sends her love. We all do. All of us. <br>
NURSE: He's the lucky one. See that girl over there? She was brought in
as Category One. She must be fifteen, sixteen. No one's tried to claim
her. We don't even know her name. Anyway, you've got till the end of
the shift and then we're moving this lot. They're going to the furnace.

DANES: That's what the Captain said. He tried to tell me that my life
has become a very small thing. Tiny. And yet right here, right now, at
the very end, I would describe myself differently. I would call myself
vital. <br>

JACK: Thank you. <br>
GWEN: I still don't get it. What are we looking at? The Blessing, is it
the rock or is it the edge? What? <br>
JACK: It's the gap in between, the nothingness. The space. It's alive. <br>
DANES: It's like they broke the world. <br>
GWEN: You're the expert. What is it? <br>
JACK: The world's been turning for over four billion years. There's so
much buried under its skin. The Doctor used to say there's Silurian
mythology,
Huon particles, Racnoss energy, an expansion of their hibernation
matrix, maybe. <br>

JACK: No. <br>

attacked, so it took the blood pattern and made it a gift. It's
exerting itself to sustain every person on the planet. This whole

fit in. <br>
MOTHER: That's the way the world works. Now, we're just making it
official. The families have just been waiting. Now we can step in to

controls people.

GWEN: Oh, great. So it's the world according to Kitzinger, is it? <br>
JILLY: Listen, you can bleed your liberal heart all over the place, but
are you really gonna tell me the world was working before?
Because I have worked for the rich and the powerful and the obese. I
have stared into the high end of Western society and let me tell you,
it is like
shoveling an open sewer. These families, they want to make the world
fitter, more compact, more disciplined. And I like the sound of that.
That sounds like salvation. <br>

REX: Just listen to me! Jack! All right. I'm all right. As I was
saying, if you need Jack's blood, how about this? <br>

shudders.) <br>

Miracle Day. <br>

suspected. All we did was keep one final bag, filled the rest with
Rex's blood, and Jack's mortal blood <br>

take every last drop. You'll both die, gentlemen. You'll both kill
yourselves. You will die in a pit in Shanghai. Is that what you want? <br>

die, and we have infinite resources. We can help her. We can make her
better. <br>

GWEN: Yes, I know it's Esther, and it's my dad and it's everyone who's
ever gonna die. But, Rex, we've got to do this and I'm gonna tell you
why. Because I'm standing here and I'm staring at Oswald Danes. And he
chose when that girl lived and he chose when that girl died. And no one
should have that power. Not the rich, not the mad, not anyone. <br>

cleft. The chambers tremble and the guards panic.) <br>
GWEN [OC]: And that's what I did. In a pit in old Shanghai I brought
death back to the world. They said it was like a breath. The breath
that went around the whole wide world. The last breath. And then no
more. We said goodbye to them then, the dads and the mums, the sick and
the old,
the friends and the neighbours, and the people we once met, and the
people whose names we never knew. We said goodbye to them all on the
day that death came back. </font></p>
