TOSH: It's my grandfather's eighty eighth birthday today. <br>
JACK: I thought you'd gone to all this trouble for me. <br>
TOSH: Eighty eight is a joyous year for the Japanese. I'm off to London
to watch grown men throw rice. <br>

dashing young soldiers and pretty young ladies. And as they danced, the
girls would look into their partners' eyes, smile softly and say <br>
(He twirls Tosh around.) <br>
TOSH: Jack, mind my laptop. <br>
JACK: I was thinking more along the lines of, and how long before you
head off to war? <br>

JACK: Come on. There's nothing here but memories and dust. <br>

were any further movements. The Rift's been opening more and more
recently. <br>

TOSH: I have a life there. And they can't help us back at the Hub
because I have the latest readings in here. People are staring at us. <br>

IANTO: You were in love with her, weren't you? <br>
OWEN: If Tosh knows a way of opening the Rift, maybe we can get Diane
back. <br>

tonight. It's last day of OTU tomorrow. Apologise to the gentleman,

shut down in 1989. Due to be demolished in one week. Now, the reported
music is from the 1940s. <br>

TOSH: Then share. <br>
JACK: You wouldn't want that. Trust me. We have to get back. What's in
here? <br>
TOSH: I've got half the equation in here. The other half's back at the
Hub. If I can find some way of getting these figures back to base, then
they can combine them and open the Rift and bring us back through. <br>

TOSH: This period. You look like you fit in. Have you been here before?
<br>
JACK: Yeah. I can't explain but I served in the war in 1941. I was
undercover. I needed a false identity, so I took his name. <br>

CAPTAIN: So what do I do? Tell 'em I saw a young boy get shot in the

CAPTAIN: Do you? Did you hear him on the radio yelling for his mom,
while the Messerschmitts pumped him full of holes and blew his plane
apart?
All I can hear on the radio <br>
JACK: Is screams. I went to war when I was a boy. I was with my best
friend. We got caught crossing the border over enemy lines. They
tortured him, not me, because he was weaker. They made me watch him
die. And they let me go. <br>

JACK: The worst possible creatures you can imagine. I persuaded him to
join up. I said it would be an adventure. He hadn't lived. <br>
