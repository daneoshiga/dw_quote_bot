IANTO: Gwen, texting you the location. Appearing four or five signs of
life, definitely non-human. Get here as soon as you can. <br>
OWEN: So, sure they're not Weevils? <br>
TOSH: Don't think so. Different energy patterns. I can't make sense of
it. Not a species we've encountered before. <br>
OWEN: Well, let's hope they're friendly, then. <br>

floors. Toshiko with me.

either end of the building. <br>

JACK: You know, these creatures are very quiet. <br>
OWEN: Maybe they're sleeping. <br>

covered ground next to wicker baskets and a cart.) <br>
JACK: Oh, not again. <br>

and that hurts. Then he sees two women in late Victorian clothes
watching him.) <br>
JACK: Ladies. Torso of steel, shilling a feel. Any takers? Bar fight,
got a little out of control. Flesh wound. Whoa. Whoa! Still not used to
these hangovers.
Captain Jack Harkness. How long have you been there? Silent types.
That's okay. I used to date a guy with no mouth. Surprisingly creative.

(A knee to the abdomen, a punch to the jaw and Jack goes down. The one
in knickerbockers sits on his chest.) <br>

JACK: Been trying to figure that out myself. <br>

the last six months. <br>
JACK: Feels like more than that. <br>
EMILY: Who's the Doctor? <br>
JACK: No idea. <br>
ALICE: Hmm. The Doctor, he will be able to fix me. When the Doctor
turns up, it'll all be put right. You wait till I see the Doctor. First
I'm going to kiss
him, then I'm going to kill him. Transcripts of your conversations with
strangers, in various drinking dens, since you first came to our
attention. <br>
JACK: You know, no one likes a smart-ass. <br>
ALICE: Tell us where he is and well release you. <br>
JACK: Why do you want to know? <br>
EMILY: You're in Torchwood, Cardiff. The Torchwood Institute was
created to combat the threat posed by the Doctor and other
phantasmagoria. <br>
JACK: He's not a threat. The Doctor's the one who'll save you from your
phantasmahoojits. <br>
EMILY: Just tell us his location. <br>
JACK: I don't know! He left me behind. I came here to find him. He
refuels from that Rift you have.
Hoping if I stayed here long enough, we'd find each other. Now, can I

BLOWFISH: I haven't done anything. <br>
JACK: Twelve burglaries, joyriding a horse and carriage, seven cases of
pick-pocketing, twenty four instances of consuming food without paying
for it. It's like an addiction with your species, isn't it. <br>
BLOWFISH: Ill make it up, I promise. <br>
JACK: Oh, too late. <br>
BLOWFISH: Its just a bit of fun. <br>
JACK: This planet's a century away from official first contact with
alien life. You're upsetting the schedule. <br>

them to long term storage? <br>

EMILY: Your liberty is at our discretion. Work for us, you assist the

don't recognise.) <br>

turn twice before you find each other again. <br>

ALEX: Me. <br>
JACK: What? Why? <br>
ALEX: We got it wrong, Jack. We thought we could control the stuff we
found. And what's it brought us? So much death. <br>
JACK: What happened to them? <br>
ALEX: It's good you're here. Always did have great timing. This place,
its yours. Torchwood Three. My gift to you, Jack, for a century of
service as field operative. Give this place a purpose before it's too
late. Please. <br>
JACK: Alex, listen. It's gonna be okay. <br>
ALEX: No, it's not. It's really not. <br>
(He is holding a silver fob watch or locket.) <br>
ALEX: I looked inside. It showed me what's coming. They were mercy
killings. It was the kindest thing I could do, so none of us see the
storm. <br>

ALEX: I'm sorry I can't do the same for you. Twenty first century,

BOB: I doubt it. <br>

underside of her drawer tidy and unlocks his office. She gets today's
access code from his computer - X74JGF8I3W - whilst checking how far
the security guard is on his rounds, then goes out and runs through the
building. Tosh dodges sweeping security cameras and gets into a secure
storage room with the code. She finds the 'Your Eyes Only' blueprints
she is looking for and hides them up her jumper. Finally she goes back
to the office, gets her coat and leaves properly. Down at the entrance,
the night guard is on duty.) <br>

JACK: Yeah, kind of. But first you had to grasp the concept of what a
sonic modulator does. Most people would struggle with that.
And another thing. The plans don't work. <br>
TOSH: What? <br>
JACK: The technical plans you followed, they were wrong. They had
mistakes in them. That's why the plans were shelved.
But you, Toshiko Sato, you automatically fixed things as you went. What
I'm trying to say is, oh baby, you're good.
I mean, you're good now. Imagine what you'd be like with a little

I've got somewhere nice and big where you can fly around. <br>

JACK: We need a guard dog. <br>
IANTO: I can be that. Like a receptionist, building maintenance, food
and drink. Dry cleaning, even. That coat of yours must take a

JACK: I'm going to be the decoy. <br>
IANTO: And it will rip you to shreds. <br>
JACK: Dinosaurs? Had them for breakfast. Had to. Only source of
pre-killed food protein after the asteroid crashed. Long story. Here
you go. <br>
(Jack gives Ianto the hypodermic.) <br>
One injection to the central nervous cortex. Ill keep it occupied.
Move. <br>
IANTO: No. <br>
JACK: What? <br>
(Ianto hands the hypodermic back.) <br>
IANTO: It knows me. Ill be a better decoy. <br>
JACK: Way too dangerous. <br>
IANTO: No, I've got a secret weapon. Chocolate. Preferably dark. <br>

IANTO: I got your favourite. Yeah. <br>
(He throws the bar of chocolate to the pterodactyl while Jack sneaks up
from behind.) <br>
IANTO: It's good for your serotonin levels, if you've got serotonin
levels. <br>
(The pterodactyl turns around and launches into the air. Jack grabs its
legs and gets a quick flight around the warehouse.) <br>
JACK: Whoa! Ianto! <br>
(Hanging on to one leg, Jack injects the creature. Then he falls onto
Ianto.) <br>
JACK: Sorry. <br>
(They roll out of the way as the pterodactyl falls to the ground, then
stare into each other's eyes.) <br>

JIM: It doesn't mean we're wrong. <br>
OWEN: Please. Run more tests. Let's just try one more MRI scan. <br>
JIM: An MRI isn't going to make any difference. <br>

the shape and functions. When it's attacked or threatened, it emits a
toxic gas that's
fatal to humans. It clears pretty quickly. <br>
