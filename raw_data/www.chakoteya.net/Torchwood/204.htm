ADVERT: So who can you trust to transport your goods? <br>
RHYS + ADVERT: Harwood's. You won't be sorry with a Harwood's lorry. <br>
RADIO: Good morning. Today sees an improvement on the weather we've
been having recently. <br>
(He pulls over to answer his phone.) <br>
RHYS: Yeah, Ruth. Did you hear it? I wrote the last bit. What sort of
accident? Yeah, I know it. Yeah, I'll get over there now. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POLICEMAN: Stay back, please. You'll have to move
your car. <br>
RHYS: I'm Rhys Williams, manager of Harwood's Haulage. <br>
(The lorry is lying on its side and a car behind it is on its roof.) <br>
POLICEMAN: You can check on the vehicle later. <br>
RHYS: Bollocks to that, mate. I know the driver. Is he? <br>
POLICEMAN: Didn't make it. Sorry. Can you give me some details, sir? <br>
RHYS: It's Leighton. Er, Leighton Reynolds. <br>
POLICEMAN: Next of kin? <br>
RHYS: Yeah, he's got a wife. Jen. Just had a baby, man. <br>
POLICEMAN: Do you know the address? <br>
RHYS: Yeah. 54 Keppoch Street, Roath. I give him a lift to football. <br>
POLICEMAN: Thank you, sir. <br>
RHYS: Er, right. I'm gonna need to arrange to move the lorry. <br>
POLICEMAN: Not yet. There's something suspicious in the back. <br>
RHYS: It's just meat. Leighton was taking it to the abattoir. <br>
POLICEMAN: Yeah, well, whatever. Torchwood want to look at it first. <br>

watches Gwen get out with Jack, Owen and Ianto.)

OWEN: It's not like any flesh I've ever seen. <br>
GWEN: What is it? <br>
JACK: Well, as there haven't been any giant cow sightings, I suggest we
take a sample back to the Hub.

van. Confiscate it till we've done further investigations. <br>
JACK: Did you find out where it came from? <br>
IANTO: No, but it's a Harwood's lorry so they should know. <br>
GWEN: Oh, that's Rhys' firm. <br>

its genetic make-up isn't compatible with any known animal. <br>
JACK: Any idea what it is? <br>
OWEN: I'll have to scan it. But whoever's farming this meat knows it's
dodgy. See this? Official vet stamp, fit for human consumption. It's
fake.
It's good, but it's fake. <br>
JACK: Tosh, get onto the haulage firm. Find out where that meat is from
and where it's heading. </font></p>

too close to home. <br>

GWEN: No, I want to find out what's going on. Thank you, Ianto. <br>
RADIO: Harwood's. You won't be sorry with a Harwood's lorry. <br>
IANTO: Catchy. <br>
TOSH: Do you think the haulage firm are in on it, too? <br>
GWEN: Rhys? No. He doesn't know what goes in the vans. He just hires
them out. <br>
IANTO: The driver must have seen it loaded. <br>
GWEN: That doesn't implicate Rhys. He's the most honest man I know. <br>
TOSH: Have you got his direct line?

They came to us about two months back. It's a weekly contract. <br>
TOSH: Are they licensed? <br>
RHYS: Yeah, of course they're licensed. <br>
TOSH: Could you give me their address? <br>
RHYS: There's no address down here. <br>
RUTH: There's a pick-up point. They said it was hard to find. <br>
RHYS: Hello? Sorry. All I've got is a service station on the A470,
fifteen miles from Cardiff. <br>
TOSH: Do you have a contact number? <br>
RHYS: No, there's no contact number, either. <br>
TOSH: Can you tell me where your driver took the meat? <br>
RHYS: Yes, he was taking it to Caerwen Abattoir. It's a processing
plant. Just a general meat suppliers. <br>
TOSH: What time did the driver leave base? <br>
RHYS: Signed out at ten to one. Can I ask what this is about? <br>

RHYS: Yeah, but I'm the manager <br>

just went through him. <br>

say it takes twenty minutes to load. We are talking a ten mile radius. <br>
OWEN: Jack! <br>
JACK: Yeah?

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Autopsy room]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OWEN: The scan shows it's definitely alien meat. <br>
JACK: Where the hell would they get it from? <br>
TOSH: If it's going into the processing plant that means it's going
into pies, burgers, pasties, everything. <br>
GWEN: That means people have been eating it for months. <br>
OWEN: Well, the DNA traces are stable. There are some signs of animal
sedative, but no diseases or residues. My guess is it's good to eat. <br>
GWEN: Would you eat it? <br>
IANTO: Pizza's arrived. I presumed it would be a late one. <br>
OWEN: What did you get me? <br>
IANTO: Your usual. Meat Feast. <br>
OWEN: Lovely

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Later, Owen is still picking the meat off his
pizza.) <br>
IANTO: I've narrowed it down to three potential areas. Only one
warehouse is unoccupied. It's just outside Merthyr. <br>
OWEN: Makes sense. Who knows what goes on there? <br>
JACK: We've got to shut the operation down, neutralise whoever's doing
this and identify the alien meat. Tosh, you can coordinate. <br>
(Gwen gets a text from Rhys. Can I see you?) <br>
GWEN: I have to slip home and check on Rhys first. <br>
JACK: Good idea. Find out how much he knows. <br>
GWEN: That's not what I meant.

RHYS: Er, bit of a tough day. Had an accident at work. One of our
lorries crashed. <br>
GWEN: Anyone hurt? <br>
RHYS: Leighton. One of my drivers died. <br>
GWEN: Oh, no. <br>
RHYS: He was only twenty four. <br>
GWEN: Were you close? <br>
RHYS: For God's sake, Gwen, you met him. Small, dark hair, played five
a side with me. <br>
GWEN: Sorry. I can't, I can't place him. <br>
RHYS: Well, then I hear that the, er, that the police have taken the
meat out the back of the van. You any idea why? <br>
GWEN: How would I know? <br>
RHYS: You work for them. <br>
GWEN: I don't deal in traffic accidents, so <br>
RHYS: Well, they phoned the office and they asked loads of questions.
Thing is, all I do is hire out the lorries, so I <br>
GWEN: Then there's nothing for you to worry about, is there? <br>
RHYS: Must be something dodgy going on, though. <br>
GWEN: If there was, you weren't to know, were you? <br>
RHYS: No, of course not. <br>
GWEN: No. I wish I didn't have to go back to work now. <br>
RHYS: Hardly worth you coming home. <br>
GWEN: Yes, it was. To see you. I'm sorry. I'll see you later. Go and
have a pint. Call Daf. <br>
RHYS: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will. </font></p>

meeting Jack by the Water Tower.) <br>
GWEN: Like I thought. He has no idea what's going on. <br>
JACK: Would you care to accompany me to the slaughterhouse? <br>
(Jack offers Gwen his arm, and she takes it.) <br>
GWEN: Have you ever eaten alien meat? <br>
JACK: Yeah. <br>
GWEN: What was it like? <br>
JACK: He seemed to enjoy it. <br>

slaughterhouse? Are you in position? <br>
IANTO [OC]: Yes, it's all quiet here. There's a deserted access road to
the side. We won't get noticed. I'll direct you in. <br>

a habit you can't be arsed to break? <br>

a cover story. <br>

anything in your life that's actually based on truth? <br>

GWEN: You think I enjoy keeping all this stuff to myself? <br>
RHYS: Then why did you? <br>

about that? No. No. Because you prefer to blunder in without thinking
or looking.

but his brain is a million miles fucking back. <br>

RHYS: Piss off. <br>
GWEN: No, you piss off <br>
RHYS: If you're not going to take it seriously <br>
GWEN: This is why I couldn't tell you, because I hunt down aliens and I
scavenge the stuff they leave behind, and sometimes I don't believe it
myself. <br>
RHYS: What's got into you? Have you been brainwashed? Is that it, yeah?
Is that what's happened?
Because you are talking high grade shit here. <br>

JACK: Welcome to our headquarters. <br>
RHYS: It's a bit bigger than mine. So, Gwen tells me you catch aliens. <br>
JACK: That's right. <br>
OWEN: There's a Rift through space and time runs through Cardiff, Rhys,
and stuff slips in from other timelines and planets, and it's our job
to monitor it. <br>
RHYS: Are you sure they're not some kind of weird cult? <br>
GWEN: You saw that alien in the warehouse. Go on. <br>
JACK: What did you see? <br>
RHYS: It was like this huge, shapeless beast, filling the space. Like a
mound of flesh. <br>
TOSH: So it's one massive entity as opposed to several organisms. <br>
OWEN: The latest tests reveal high levels of chloride, so it probably
lives in the water. I reckon it came through the Rift, into the sea and
its beached itself. <br>
JACK: Like a giant alien manatee. <br>
IANTO: But how did they get it there? That warehouse must be fifty
metres long. <br>
RHYS: Maybe it was smaller when they found it, because they said it's
growing. <br>
JACK: It's not dead? <br>
RHYS: No, it's breathing. Its eye opened. <br>
OWEN: So the protein chains regenerate despite the mutilation. So not
only is it replenishing its own flesh but it's increasing it, giving
them a brand new meat supply. <br>
TOSH: It could last them for years, then. If we understood how it
worked, we could feed the world. <br>
IANTO: We could release a single. <br>
JACK: Before we get ahead of ourselves, we're talking about dodgy pies
in Merthyr, okay? And the fact that they're cutting it up alive,
Which we could have put a stop to already if it wasn't for you. <br>
RHYS: I thought my fiancée was in danger. <br>
JACK: Well, Mr Caveman, she wasn't. She can handle herself. <br>

RHYS: Well, if you stopped and asked me what I saw in there, instead of
showing off around the place <br>
JACK: Do I show off? <br>
IANTO: Just a bit. <br>
RHYS: You'd know I got out by telling them I wanted a job as a delivery
boy. So rather than cock things up, I've found you a way to get in.
But if you can't handle that, big boy, then you can stuff it. <br>

involved. <br>
RHYS: Oh, where was I when you to decided to get involved? Did you give
me a thought? <br>
OWEN: Oh joy, a domestic. <br>
JACK: Rhys is right. He's our best way in. Stun guns only. <br>
OWEN: We've handled bigger than this. Why don't we just storm in, guns
in the air, and arrest them? <br>
JACK: Those men aren't organised criminals. If we go in, guns blazing,
they'll kill the evidence and run. <br>
OWEN: I wasn't suggesting blazing, just waving. <br>
JACK: The last thing we need is a bloodbath. <br>
OWEN: Point taken. <br>
GWEN: I know that. <br>
JACK: Once Rhys has loaded up, he can clear. You don't have to come.
You can stand down. <br>

for real. And if you mess up, I will kill you. <br>
TOSH: So, after we've stun-gunned the workers, we put the creature out
of its misery. <br>
JACK: No. We're gonna save it. Stabilise it, wait for the Rift to open
and send it back. <br>
IANTO: Guess who'll have to look after it in the meantime. <br>
TOSH: Tell me exactly how are we going to use it to arm ourselves
against the future? <br>
OWEN: We can always hide behind it. <br>
JACK: Why shouldn't we save it? Because it's an alien? It needs our
protection. <br>
RHYS: You didn't hear its cry. Heartbreaking. <br>
IANTO: Listen to Ahab. <br>
OWEN: Jack, it's growing. <br>
JACK: Well, we'll find a way to stop it mutating. We are doing this.
