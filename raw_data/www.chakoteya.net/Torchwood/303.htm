GREEN: In light of what's happening with our children, we've
temporarily closed the schools.
As a further precaution, we have introduced a temporary curfew for
everyone under the age of eighteen. Keep your children at home where
they'll be safe. The curfew takes effect immediately and will continue
until further notice. But rest assured, we're doing everything in our
power to find out what's going on, to safeguard our children and all
the people of this nation.
In the meantime, we are asking everyone to stay calm, and to go about
your lives as normal.
There's nothing to suggest we are in any danger, and as soon as we find
out anything more, the public will be informed.
And as always, I thank you, for your trust, and for your faith.

something? <br>

thirteen. That's where they're building this thing. But Frobisher only

abduction, back when he was a kid. 1965. He was living ten miles
outside Arbroath, the Holly Tree Lodge, it was an orphanage. I looked
up the files. The kids were taken away in November 1965. The Lodge was
closing down. They were being taken to a second care home called
Harbour Heights in Plymouth, except that's where the records stopped.
There's no trace of them arriving.

would be better if, I mean, given the nature of that meeting, it would
ensure the smooth running of diplomatic relations between Earth and the
456 if that previous encounter was kept off the record.
