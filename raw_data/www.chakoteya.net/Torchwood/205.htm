wants her back in bed.) <br>

(Owen is wearing black rimmed spectacles and a cardigan.) <br>
JACK: Adam, I know how much you love audits. <br>
ADAM: It's got to be done. <br>
JACK: If you could <br>
ADAM: Go through the investigation reports, find out when they might
have come through the Rift. <br>
JACK: You okay with that? <br>
(Gwen arrives.) <br>
ADAM: I have been for the last three years. <br>
JACK: You're late. <br>
GWEN: Yes, Paris was lovely, thank you. <br>

GWEN: Who the hell is this? <br>
ADAM: Just because that's what I said to you on your first day. <br>
(Adam grips Gwen's shoulder and looks into her eyes.) <br>
ADAM: Remember? <br>

GWEN [memory]: You make a nice strong coffee. <br>
GWEN: Sorry, couldn't resist. Come here, you. Good to see you. <br>

GWEN: Hey, Tosh, you're looking good. <br>
(Later, Adam is filling in his name and date of birth on his personnel
file. Adam Smith, 16/11/82, recruited O7/O5/O5-OOOO.) <br>
TOSH: Adam, what are you doing with your personnel file? <br>
ADAM: Nothing. Just finished updating details of Rift activity. <br>
TOSH: Any idea when this came through? It's got a low meson energy
reading. <br>
(A carved box.) <br>
ADAM: No, I'll keep looking. <br>
(Adam puts his hand on the back of Toshiko's neck, and she gets
memories of kissing Adam. So they kiss.) <br>
ADAM: A year ago today. <br>
TOSH: Our first kiss. <br>
ADAM: You remembered. <br>
TOSH: You okay, Owen? <br>
OWEN: Er, yes, yes, yes. Don't worry about me. No, no, it's just er.
Kissing in work. I wasn't expecting it. <br>

TOSH: What's that? <br>
OWEN: It's a screen cleaner. I thought you might like it. Er, do you?
Do you like it? <br>
TOSH: just what I need. A small rodent looking at me while I work.
Think I'll call it Owen. <br>
(Owen sighs and goes down to the autopsy room.) <br>
GWEN: He's like a puppy bringing her sticks. When's he gonna realise
he's got no chance? <br>
IANTO: Love's blind, apparently. He's idolised her for years now. <br>

RHYS: Gwen, what's going on? <br>

RHYS: You know who I am. <br>
GWEN: Fine. If you won't tell me, fine. You stay there. Don't you move.

(Gwen gets her mobile from her handbag and dials.) <br>
GWEN: Jack? Yeah, someone's broken into my flat. He had a key. He knows
my name. <br>
RHYS: Yes, because I live here with you. <br>
GWEN: Shut it! Shut it. Yeah, can you hurry, Jack? He's a nutter. You
have picked the wrong girl to stalk, mate. <br>

GWEN: Stay there. <br>

GWEN: Jack? <br>
JACK [outside]: Gwen, it's us. <br>
(She buzzes them in.) <br>
GWEN: In here, Jack. <br>
(Jack and Adam enter, guns ready.) <br>
JACK: What's going on? <br>
GWEN: You tell me. Look, he's put photos of us up. He must have done it
while I was at work. He's deluded. He keeps saying he's my boyfriend. <br>
JACK: He is. It's Rhys. <br>
GWEN: I've never seen him before in my life. <br>
JACK: You've been with him for years. <br>
RHYS: See? <br>
JACK: Give me the gun, Gwen. <br>
GWEN: No. He grabbed me, Jack. Who knows what he was going to do? <br>
RHYS: How can you say that?. What have you done to her? <br>
JACK: Nothing. <br>
RHYS: Oh, come on. I know what kind of sick games you play. Pills to
make you forget. Is that what that is, yeah? Are you phasing me out so
you can have her all to yourself? <br>
GWEN: Stay away from him. <br>
RHYS: We're engaged! I bought you the bloody ring you're wearing. <br>
(Jack steps between Rhys and Gwen's gun while she looks at the ring.) <br>
ADAM: Why don't you come with me to the Hub? <br>
RHYS: Who the hell are you? <br>
JACK: He's one of us. <br>
ADAM: We can check you over. Jack will stay here and take care of
things. <br>
JACK: Okay? <br>
GWEN: Don't let him go. If he comes after me again, I'll kill him. <br>

JACK: Trust me, I didn't do this. But whatever's happened we'll put it
right.

JACK [OC]: Tell me about your first kiss. <br>
RHYS [on monitor]: Er, in the supermarket. I was going to make her spag
bol, and then I realised, didn't I? It's got bloody garlic. Can't kiss
a girl with garlic breath. No, we were in the queue. <br>
ADAM: Do you remember that? <br>
GWEN: Sort of. It's like I'm <br>
RHYS [OC]: I said, I want to make something else. <br>
GWEN: I'm seeing what he's saying, but I don't remember how I felt. <br>
(Adam places his hand on the side of her head.) <br>
ADAM: Believe me when I tell you that that is your fiancé. Your
memory's just playing tricks on you, that's all. <br>
GWEN: Okay. <br>
RHYS [on monitor]: She starts to laugh. She calls me Rhys the Rant. And
then she kissed me, right there in the queue.

TOSH: Have you managed to open it yet? <br>
OWEN: Er, no, sorry. I'm not doing very well, am I? <br>
TOSH: It's gonna be a long night. <br>
OWEN: Yes, which is why I've brought some sandwiches. One for you, and
one for me. Smoked salmon, that is your favourite, isn't it? <br>
TOSH: How'd you know that? I'm gonna need a beer. <br>
OWEN: What, while we're working? Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah,

ADAM: Jack, please. Talk to me. What about the past? Is it your
childhood? I've always been here for you, Jack. From the very
beginning. I'm the one you can confide in, remember? <br>
JACK: It was meant to be buried. I buried the memory over a hundred and
fifty years ago. Why now? <br>
ADAM: Well, maybe it's time. Maybe up until now your subconscious was
protecting you. But you can't block out the past forever. <br>

They came without warning. We thought they'd pass over us, like they
always did. But they didn't. Not that day. <br>

you out of my sight, Tosh, because I love you. <br>
TOSH: What? <br>
OWEN: Yeah, there we are. I've said it. I love you. Yes, I always have,
actually. Ever since we started working together, and in fact, I
actually ache for you. Physically, when you're in the room, I just want
to reach out and touch you and <br>

OWEN: No, no, no. You know, I can't keep this secret any more. My mum
said to me, seize the day, and so I am seizing it, and, you know, I've
got so much
love to give you, Tosh, and, you know, you won't know that unless I
tell you. So here I am, telling you that I love you. You know I know
there's Adam, okay, but you know, I think, on fact, I know that we
would be amazing together, if you would only just give it a chance.

out of her. It reads as truth. <br>

IANTO: She tried to get away, but I was too quick. Pleading, and I, I

ADAM: Jack, you know me. You recruited me three years ago. <br>
JACK: All I know is, when I think of my team, I see you there. But I
don't feel anything for you. No pride, no warmth. You, the one who I
can confide
in, the one who unburied the dead. <br>
GWEN: Jack, maybe you've just forgotten him, like I did with Rhys,
yeah? <br>
JACK: I should have spotted it then. That wasn't stress, that was him.
By making us think we know him, he disturbs our real memories. <br>

Look at Owen, all his cynicism gone. He's a different man now.
Selfless, happier. And Toshiko, too. She's never been this confident. <br>
JACK: How did you come here? Why us? <br>
ADAM: All of you have such unique memories, specially you, Jack. All
those extraordinary memories you hold. Some hidden, some absent. Your

GWEN [OC]: The college canteen. Rhys is sitting opposite me, telling
stupid jokes. <br>
RHYS [OC]: Where do you find a tortoise with no legs? Where you left

OWEN [OC]: It's my birthday. I'm ten. Mum spends the whole day

OWEN: That is the nicest thing you've done for me in years, Mother. <br>

TOSH [OC]: My first flat. <br>

IANTO: It gave me meaning again. You. <br>

JACK: You each have a short term amnesia pill. It'll make you forget
Adam. We have to wipe out the last forty eight hours from our memories.
Go back to who we were. <br>
(Ianto is the first to take the pill. Down in the cell, Adam is
starting to flicker and change into something with needle teeth. Tosh
switches the screen to a view of Adam.) <br>
TOSH: I'm going to lose so much. <br>
JACK: None of it was real. <br>
TOSH: He loved me and I loved him. It's no different from real memory. <br>
