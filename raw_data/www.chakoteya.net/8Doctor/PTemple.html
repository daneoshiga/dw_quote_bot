<td align="left" width="85%"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two
children on a beach, long, long ago. Both of them young enough to
believe in magic. One is the Bear Cub, round and heavy, rolling,
confident, his nose into every tumbled rock, his feet into the freezing
grey surf as it sucks over the pebbles, his blue-green eyes tracking
the misted red cliffs for paths that can be conquered. The other is the
Young Deer, long-limbed and fragile, uncertain, awkward, uncomfortable
on the rough edges of the rock, jumping back from the cold, aggressive
sea, terrified of falling from the high cliffs that his friend insists
on climbing. But they are friends, even so, because Bear Cub makes
Young Deer feel useful, and Young Deer makes Bear Cub feel brave. Today
they are building a miniature temple of stones. It doesn't look much.
Two lines of upright pebbles in the dry sand, just above the reach of
the waves. But the pebbles are special. Those on the left are smooth
and squat, those on the right, tall and angular, this marking the
difference between the principles of earth and sky. Young Deer spent
most of the morning looking for the right stones. He is the son of the
Clan Priest, and he must get this baby temple right. It's even aligned
according to the rule of stars, facing north east towards the
approximate position of the midsummer sunrise. But now it has been
spoilt. One of the stones has fallen, the victim of a scrawny seagull
searching for food. Although Young Deer is angry, he doesn't show it.
The stone can always be put back in place. But before he can act, Bear
Cub is running across the temple, knocking one of the other stones over
as he goes. <br>'I'm going to catch that bird and kill it,' he says,
though the gull has already flown away and become indistinguishable
from a hundred others riding the wind, half-obscured by the mild steamy
drizzle blowing in from the sea. When he realises that the bird is out
of reach, he runs back up the beach towards the winter settlement, a
straggling collection of thatch-topped huts built inside a high
stockade above the river.<br>'Stop!' calls Young Deer. <br>He doesn't want
to be left alone on the beach. Without his powerful friend to protect
him, he might be set upon and beaten by the gang of boys who call
themselves the Bear Men. But he doesn't want to leave the beach,
doesn't want to leave his temple half-built because of this one
accident. He starts to run after Bear Cub. 'Stop!' Bear Cub half-turns,
dancing on the spot as he shouts back to his friend. <br>'I'm going to get my bow. I'm going to shoot that bird.'<br>Bear
Cub's father won't let him shoot gulls on the beach. The chance of
losing an arrow is too great. But Bear Cub doesn't remember this in his
anger and impatience. Young Deer does. He always remembers when Bear
Cub forgets. This is another reason why they are friends. <br>'I've got a better idea,' he yells. <br>In
fact he hasn't, yet, but he knows that if he thinks quickly he can
probably come up with something more exciting and immediate than
shooting a seagull. Bear Cub doesn't stop his dancing on the spot, but
at least he doesn't run off. <br>'What? What is it?'<br>'My father,'
begins Young Deer, still thinking. 'When he does the sacrifices. Yes,
yes, this will work. He can substitute one animal for another. If the
gods call for the sacrifice of a boar and the hunters can't catch one,
he'll kill a goat instead. So we could kill something else instead of
the seagull. You could get a fish from one of the pools.'<br>This is an
inspiration. Bear Cub never tires of showing off his speed and skill
catching the slippery finger-sized fish with a single swoop of his net.
Young Deer is hopeless at it. They always get away from him, even when
the pool is almost dry. It works. Bear Cub is already trotting back,
his eyes alight, a huge grin on his face.<br>'I can go one better than that,' he says. He always can. 'I can take a baby seagull from one of the nests on the cliff.'<br>Young
Deer feels a thrill of anticipation. This is reckless, brave,
interesting. It's something he couldn't possibly do, but if his friend
does it, then he will share in the glory.<br>'Right,' says Bear Cub, breathing the answer in his friends face. 'I know a path that will get us there.'<br>(Cries of gulls.)<br>The
stone is upright again, stained with the young bird's blood. The flock
are still screaming overhead, but they've given up diving at the two
boys. Probably they know that the bundle of guts and bloodied brown
feathers is no longer alive. But Young Deer was afraid of them, diving
like that, even as he carried out the sacrifice. Bear Cub wasn't
afraid, of course. In fact, he quite enjoyed the thrill of it, swatting
at the screaming white bodies, collecting a couple of long, perfect
wing feathers. He's already thinking that he'd like to catch an adult
seagull alive, so that it can be sacrificed. He's not sure what would
be achieved by this, but it should be fun trying, and he could mount
the long feathers in a headdress afterwards. He picks up a stone and
lobs it at the flock. Young Deer, for his part, is thinking about his
temple. It won't last. If nothing else, the sea will demolish it with
the next high tide.<br>'We should build a temple on the sheep pasture,' he tells Bear Cub. <br>'Why?'<br>'Because
it'll last longer.' In fact, Young Deer is thinking again. 'A circle
would be better, because circles have more power, like the Great
Temple.l<br>'The Great Temple's made of wood,' observe Bear Cub.<br>'Yes, but we can make a little one of stone.'<br>Bear Cub's eyes light up as the idea hits his brain and germinates.<br>'Or we could make a big one. As big as the Great Temple, but made of stones.'<br>He
begins looking around the beach, as if he hopes to find suitable stones
now and drag them upright himself. But this time it's Young Deer who
goes one better. <br>'Not just as big as the Great Temple, but the Great Temple itself, rebuilt in stone.'<br>He
can see it now. The inner and outer circles, a totem carved wooden post
replaced by stones. If the stones were big enough, and if the pits they
stood in were deep enough, then nothing could knock them over. It would
be the most powerful temple in the world. It would last for ever. He
turns, looks not at the sea but the land. Hunched enormous hills framed
by red cliffs, crowned by the brown winter skeletons of trees. He feels
a wild excitement as the image of the stone temple in his mind
superimposes itself on the land. If he can make this happen, he will
have made something as huge and eternal as the land itself. He will be
immortal. <br>'Come on,' says Bear Cub, impatiently. 'Let's go and
find some really big stones. I'll get my brother to help us move them,
if you like.'<br>But Young Deer stops his friend with a raised hand.
'No,' he says. 'If we're going to build a proper temple, there are
things we need to do first.'<br>He's thinking of a sacrifice, of
course, to obtain the blessing of the ancestors. But even he doesn't
realise how many sacrifices will be needed. Not yet. <br><br>'Doctor?'<br>'Hmm?'
The Doctor was propped up in his favourite armchair, feet on a stool,
reading. A red mug of cocoa was on the arm of his chair, and Sam was
cradling another one in her hands. In her lap was a book. A glossy, old
fashioned, rather heavy hardback book.<br>'I want to see Stonehenge.'<br>'What century?'<br>Sam grinned. She liked the way that the Doctor was never, ever, taken aback, and usually managed to one one further. <br>'When it was built. It says in this book that no one will ever be sure how they moved the stones.'<br>The Doctor glanced up. 'Magic.'<br>Sam was surprised, but did her best not to show it. <br>'Did it work?' she asked, as casually as she could manage.<br>'No. They had to use ropes in the end.' The Doctor grinned at his little joke and went back to his book. <br>Sam
was disappointed. More disappointed than she'd expected. She hadn't
really believed there was any magic in an old stone circle, but
'There's no magic then?'<br>'No,' she glanced down at her book, 'meeting of ley lines, no temple of the people?'<br>The
Doctor glanced up sharply. 'I didn't say that. But magic isn't usually
very useful. Any magic sufficiently advanced becomes indistinguishable
from technology, and no fun any more.'<br>'Shouldn't that be any technology sufficiently advanced?'<br>'Yes,' said the Doctor. 'That's another way of putting it. Did you know that Henry James believed in ghosts?'<br>'No,'
said Sam, then, well aware that the Doctor, given half a chance would
start on a digression about how he'd met the novelist at some function
in 1872 or suggested the ending of one of his novels, she added quickly
'but I'd still like to see Stonehenge when it was new, when people used
it as a temple.'<br>'Are you sure about that? said the Doctor. 'It was
the late stone age, you know. There were a lot of very nasty ceremonies
involved. I don't think you'll like it. Megalithomania, I believe one
archaeologist called it.'<br>Sam sighed. 'Have we had this conversation
before? You don't try to keep me from seeing things just because you
think I won't like them, okay?'<br>The Doctor met her eyes. She didn't
look away. He took a deep breath. 'Okay. Yes, if that's the way you
want it. He got up, his mug of cocoa in his hands, and walked towards
the console.<br><br>'Pull!'<br>Like oxen, Dorlan felt the ropes bite
into his chest as a group of them hauled on the stone in the near
darkness. He put all the strength he had into the task, leaning into
the ropes. His feet slipped on the muddy ground made slick by the
endless rain. <br>'Pull!'<br>They
work you like oxen on that temple of theirs. Dorlan risked a glance over
his shoulder. The stone hadn't moved, but in the light of the flames it
seemed to dance against the black sky like an angry spirit. The spirit
of evil, perhaps. Dorlan shivered. He was sure this was the biggest
stone yet. Somehow in the rain and darkness they'd got it into the pit
that had been dug for it. Now it stood upright but tilted. All that
remained was to pull it to the vertical, always the hardest part of the
job.<br>'Pull!'<br>They will slaughter you when they've finished, like
an ox that can't work any more. Fighting his exhaustion, Dorlan made
himself pull again. The aching whip scars on his shoulders reminded him
what would happen if the stone didn't move this time. From the corner
of his eye he could the Bear men standing, waiting, staring at the
stone. It will be better to die, my son. No it won't, thought Dorlan,
fiercely. He remembered his father's face twisted in rage and pain and
humiliation, and the spear wound that he had received in the battle
bleeding each morning, and finally swelling until his father,
black-faced, had died in agony, leaving Dorlan barely a man, chief of a
conquered people. But it isn't better to die. It isn't. He yanked on
the rope, almost slipping again. <br>'Come on!' he gasped. 'Pull! We'll get this thing built for them yet, and then we'll go home. Pull!'<br>There
was a ragged cheer. Dorlan felt the weight on his shoulders increase.
The weight of responsibility. His people still believed in him. If he
told them to pull, they pulled harder. But the ropes bit, Dorlan's feet
slipped in the mud, the stone didn't move. Dorlan looked across at the
fires, the children whose job it was to keep them burning. He saw his
sister, Saffan, run up with some dry wood, her eyes blinking furiously
in the smoke, swaying a little as she stood and fed the flames. She
looked at the limit of her strength, like Dorlan, like every single one
of his people, man, woman and child. When had any of them last slept?
The Great Bear, the king of these Bear Men, was insane. <br>'Why aren't you telling them to pull?' <br>Dorlan
became aware of a shadow standing over him. He looked up, saw antlers
shifting in the flame light, and the shadow of a man's body. Deer hide
with the hooves still attached swaying like charms. The click of bones,
deer bones from the necklace he wore. Shalin, the Deer Man, the magic
maker. Dorlan shivered. Even though Dorlan had never seen him hurt
anyone, the Deer Man was somehow more frightening than his master. His
bright eyes, his constant talk of numbers, and rotations, and
elevations, and plans, and circles. His southern mysteries, as he
called them, made him seem both more and less than human. A god, but
not a kind one. <br>'It
isn't working,' he told Shalin, trying to keep his voice from shaking.
'We haven't the strength to do it. Perhaps if we rested?'<br>'There
isn't time,' snapped the Deer Man. 'There are ten more stones waiting
at the end of the Great Avenue, and they must all be laid before the
solstice ceremony can be held. That's ten days away, so it's one stone
a day, understand? And this is yesterday's stone, so it must be done
tonight!'<br>Dorlan shut his eyes wearily. It didn't make any sense.
None of it made any sense. Working in the winter, in the rain, was
stupid enough. Working all night was pointless. Everyone would be too
tired to work in the day, and why by the solstice? Even the Deer Man
wasn't pretending that the temple would be completed by then. <br>'I'm
going to try something,' said Shalin, suddenly. He was standing in
front of them now, an antlered silhouette against the fire-lit stone.
He was moving his fingers above his head. The long, dead legs of the
deer hide swaying from his wrists. Dorlan recognised the gestures.
Counting, he called it. Another of his southern mysteries. Finally
Shalin seemed satisfied. He moved to one side of the team near to where
Saffan still stood, weary, by the fire.<br>'I want everyone from here,'
Shalin stamped on the ground with his foot, then danced across to the
other side of the team, 'to here, to pull when I say Bear. Then I want
everyone from here to' He danced again, the antlers swaying in the
light and the necklace of deer bones clicking. 'Over here to pull when
I say Deer. Understand?'<br>Dorlan was fairly sure that what Shalin was
trying to do wasn't going to help. If all the men pulling together
couldn't move the stone, how could half of them do it? But he knew
better than to argue. He watched, still confused, as Shalin separated
the two teams until each was at an angle to the stone. The ropes
shifted, dripped water. At last Shalin walked forward, taking a place
between the two teams. The rain was heavier now, threatening to dowse
the fires. Dorlan could hear the water hissing as it hit the burning
wood, like a snake. <br>'Yes, father,' thought Dorlan dumbly. 'It's probably an omen. But what can I do?'<br>'Deer!'
shouted Shalin. Men pulled. 'Bear!' Dorlan pulled, felt the stone move
slightly. Or had the rope just been a little slack? 'Deer!' <br>'Pull!'<br>'Bear!'<br>'Pull!'<br>Another
slight movement. This time Dorlan was sure it was the stone shifting.
Perhaps the Deer Man's incomprehensible plan was going to work. <br>'Deer!'<br>'Pull.'<br>'Bear!'<br>The
rope went slack. For an instant Dorlan thought it had broken, then he
heard Shalin yell something in his own language, his voice high and
panicky. He heard earth breaking, a huge popping sound, a crack of wood
and a grinding of stone. Dorlan struggled to turn around, clumsy in his
harness. He saw the stone tilting, no, falling towards the fire and the
children.<br>'Saffan!' he shouted, 'Run!'<br>But the hammerhead was
already slamming into the fire, and burning fragments were flying in
all directions. One of the children screamed, and went on screaming.
Dorlan shrugged off his harness, ran through the tangle of slack ropes
and confused, frightened people, towards the fallen stone. He almost
fell twice in the slick mud. The screaming had stopped, but Dorlan
could hear a gasping, gurgling sound which was much more frightening. <br>'Dorlan.' Saffan's voice. 'Quick, it's Marin.' Her best friend. <br>He
reached the stone, scrambled around it, almost burning himself on the
smouldering fragments of the fire. On the far side, Saffan was
standing, her eyes wide, staring down at a shape in the shadow of the
stone. Dorlan approached, saw that the shape was Marin. As his eyes
adjusted to the dim red light he made out the child's head, her arm,
part of her chest. The rest was buried under the fallen stone.<br>'She's dead,' Saffan informed him expressionlessly. 'I'll tell her mother.' Then she turned on her heel and walked away.<br>Dorlan
knelt down, put a hand in front of the girl's mouth. But Saffan was
right. There was no breath. He felt his heart pound, his muscles tense
in helpless anger and frustration. Marin had been a happy, healthy
child. In time she would have made a good wife, a good mother of many
children, and he knew she had been learning the hide stitching craft
that was her mother's. Now she would stitch no hides, marry no one, be
mother to no one, and Dorlan's people would be the worse for it. He hit
his fists against the grey stone. The shock and pain jolted him to his
feet, his head buzzing with anger.<br>'Why did this happen?' he yelled. 'Who did this?'<br>At
his words, light burst around the long side of the fallen stone. The
strong light of lanterns burning with rendered oil. A huge man stood
there, careless of the still smouldering ruins of the fire around his
feet. He was dressed in the hide of a bear, with the long shaggy winter
fur still attached. A square plate of gold burned on his chest, and
below that a dark belt held the bronze dagger and axe of the man who
called himself Great High Supreme Chieftain and King, Lord of All the
Lands and All the Peoples. Coyn, the Great Bear. Two of his Bear men
stood on either side, one with a flare, one with a raised axe. They
always stood like that, ready to kill anyone who approached their
master without permission. <br>'Who did this?' said Coyn suddenly,
repeating Dorlan's words, his eyes on Dorlan's face. 'You know, I was
about to ask that myself, but you said it first.' He took a step
forward. 'That must be an omen, don't you think?<br><br>'That's it! '
said the Doctor, pointing straight in front of them. 'The temple of the
great people of the Bear.' He flashed her a bright grin. 'Known to some
later humans as Stonehenge.'<br>Sam
looked, but she wasn't quite sure
what he was pointing at. It was still only half light. Grey clouds
raced in the wind and the air was full of a thin, cold drizzle. Worse,
Salisbury Plain in the late Neolithic appeared to be a built up area.
From the edge of the forest where she and the Doctor were standing, Sam
could see two large clusters of rotund wooden huts with thatched roofs,
each encircled by a high wooden stockade. There were other, more
distant, stockades that she couldn't see inside and several individual
wooden buildings, mostly circular, some quite large. She also counted
at least a dozen mounds that were obviously artificial. The two biggest
were the size of small hills, and capped with trees. There were quite a
few standing stones, one of them surrounded with something that looked
almost like modern scaffolding. None in anything that resembled the
circular pattern. And everywhere there were artificial banks, lines of
posts, brown strips on the earth that Sam first thought were roads,
then decided might be fields of some sort. Everything overlapped
everything else. Fences crossed fields, rows of posts ascended to
hulking longbarrows. The half-light added to the sense of mystery and
confusion. Sam realised that it was probably before sunrise. Despite
all the buildings, she could see no people about. She admitted defeat
at last. <br>'Which one is the temple?'<br>'The
big one. Low, flat. See the stones rising above the stockade? Those are
the trilithons. I think they've got three of them up already.'<br>Sam
looked again, saw a shadow of grey.&nbsp;Yes, one of the stockades on
top of a low earth bank. It was about a kilometre away, and seemed to
enclose a roughly circular space. It was hard to see inside in the poor
light. They weren't really far enough above the structure for that. But
now she was sure what she was looking at, Sam realised she could just
see the flat tops of grey stones inside. She felt her heart hammering
with excitement, and set off across the muddy ground, dodging tussocky
grass and loose stones, letting the Doctor tag along behind for a
change. <br>A black bony dog ran out of a derelict looking hut, barked at Sam as she passed, then sniffed the air and howled.<br>'Sam!'<br>She looked over her shoulder.<br>'Come back, you're going the wrong way.'<br>Sam looked around at the dark landscape, confused. She had been looking at the right place, hadn't she?<br>'You said it was straight ahead.'<br>'Yes, but we have to approach it properly.'<br>'Ah.
This is respecting their culture, isn't it?' she said aloud. 'We're
guests on their lands so we have to follow their routes.'<br>But the
Doctor had already marched off along a line of carved posts almost
directly away from their destination. Sam could see now that it ended
in another stockade surrounding a longbarrow. Two grey stones were just
visible at the entrance, standing like guards with a carved wooden
lintel between them.<br>'This is one of the ceremonial routes,' the
Doctor said without looking around. 'There were five others we could
have taken, according to the season, but,' he looked around and flashed
her another brilliant smile, 'I think you'll agree when you've seen it,
that this is the pretty one.'<br>Sam was still grinning to herself when they heard a man scream. <br><br>'Who
did this?' Coyn's question was an animal growl, the call of an angry
bear. He twisted Dorlan's arm again, and again Dorlan screamed with
pain. He was sure the arm was already broken. He could feel the
wrongness in the way it moved, and the pain as if a knife were cutting
the flesh away from inside. He looked up, his eyes misting, and saw his
sister hiding her face in her hands, sobbing.<br>'The rain did it.' he said, wishing that his voice sounded more like a man's, less a boy's half-choked sob. 'The rain. It fell.'<br>'This didn't happen because of the rain. The pit was deliberately weakened.' <br>Coyn
twisted the broken arm again. Dorlan gritted his teeth, but the scream
escaped. His vision blurred and he felt tears trickling down his
cheeks. The shame was almost worse than the pain.<br>Dorlan became
aware that another face had appeared in front of him. A face painted
with red and white clay in the curved lines of the Deer Man. The look
in his brown, deer-like eyes was curiously sympathetic. His glance kept
sliding sideways towards Coyn, who was pacing up and down beside the
stone that had fallen. There was fear in that glance.<br>'You didn't do
it, did you,' said the Deer Man quietly, 'but you know who did. Now,
tell me, and I'll mend your arm, and you won't have to work again. And
your sister won't have to work.'<br>'No one.' Dorlan's teeth were chattering.<br>'Give
him a name, Dorlan,' said the Deer Man. 'Any name. It doesn't matter
who. If you don't, he'll just kill you, then somebody else, then
somebody else.'<br>Dorlan felt a wave of faintness. For a moment he was
floating above the northern waters, the place where his people had
lived before they were conquered, and his father was speaking to him
again. But he couldn't understand the words. He heard shouting, and
opened his eyes, the Deer Man's dark face still peering into his. And
the voice of his father's brother, Teln.<br>'Stop this. The stone fell because of an accident. Any one can see that.'<br>The
sound of a blow, a grunt of pain, a woman's scream. Dorlan tried to sit
up, was surprised when the Deer Man helped him. He saw his people
crowding forward in the half-light, the Bear Men standing with their
axes and spears at the ready. Responsibility.<br>'Stop it,' he called
weakly, his voice catching in his throat. The shouting went on. Dorlan
fought the pain, made himself take a deep breath. If they tried to
fight now, they would all be killed.<br>'Stop it!'<br>There was silence. The Great Bear, who had been standing with his men, turned slowly and looked down at&nbsp;him. <br>'I
am the Chieftain. I'll take responsibility for this,' said Dorlan.
'Kill me. Do whatever you want, but leave the rest of my people alone.'<br>Coyn laughed. Laughed so hard that his necklace of bear's teeth rattled.<br>'Dorlan,
it's good to see such bravery from the son of a man I killed. It shows
that you have the true spirit of a warrior of your people. And you know
what?' He took a pace forward, leaned down and put his face so close to
Dorlan's that the young man could smell the rotting meat on the king's
breath. 'I'm going to accept your courage, and respond to it in kind.
You're going to die for this.'<br>For a moment Dorlan simply didn't
believe him, but then the Great Bear stood up and shouted, 'Bring the
drums. Bring the masks. We're going to have a sacrifice, here, now!'<br>The
Bear Men started to move, heavy feet splashing in the pools of water
that lay all over the muddy ground. Dorlan watched, his body shaking,
and slowly realised that the insane king was serious. He was going to
die.<br><br>'Come on, Doctor. We've got to do something to help those people.'<br>As
soon as they'd worked out that the screaming was coming from the temple
itself, Sam and the Doctor had hurried across the open ground between
the posts and the earth bank that surrounded the temple, scrambling over
a fence, through a muddy ditch and squeezing between a line of tall
posts carved in animal totems. But now the Doctor had stopped dead,
staring ahead into the growing light. There was only a narrow muddy
ditch between them and the embankment. The wind gusted and Sam could
hear chanting, the regular beat of a wooden drum. <br>'That can't be
right,' muttered the Doctor. He pulled a watch out of his waistcoat
pocket and consulted it, then looked up at Sam, an expression of
consternation on his face. 'I think we've come at the wrong time. We
should go back to the Tardis, now.'<br>Sam stared at him. He was deadly
serious. 'No,' she said simply. The sound of her own voice surprised
her. She met his eyes. 'You're going to tell me this is some sort of
ceremony. But that scream wasn't ceremonial and you know it. That was
someone being.' She searched for a word. 'Violated.'<br>'Sam,' said the
Doctor, his voice low, 'I made a mistake. I thought this was a safe
time for you to see the temple, but it obviously isn't. We have to go.'<br>'But it isn't a ceremony. It isn't part of anyone's culture. It's'<br>'Sam. Sam! How can you know what is and what isn't a ceremony four and a half thousand years before you were born?'<br>'I know. Believe me.' Sam took a breath, then turned away from him and jumped across the ditch. <br>'Sam, no!'<br>She
stumbled on the far side, half falling into the filthy water. Looking
back, she saw the Doctor standing against the brown streaks of fields
and the dark shadows of trees, his hair dancing in the wind.<br>'I'm going to find out what's happening,' she said. 'I won't interfere, not if it's a real ceremony.'<br>'Even if people are being killed?'<br>Well,
she'd deal with that one when she got there. She scrambled up the far
bank, her jeans soaked to the knee, her sweatshirt covered in mud, her
nose full of the stomach-turning smell. In front of her was the
stockade around Stonehenge. It wasn't very tall, and she'd have been
able to climb over it quite easily if it hadn't been topped with
savagely sharp spikes. The wood was also thickly embedded with sharp
fragments of bone, of pottery and even of stone. Through the narrow
gaps between the posts she caught tantalising glimpses of stones, fire,
people's faces. The drum was beating again, single slow beats. Someone
was shouting. No, chanting. The Doctor was right. This did sound like a
ceremony. Could she have made a mistake? For all she knew, the screams
could have been someone injured in an accident, and this was a healing
ceremony. Well, she was going to take a look anyway. She began jogging
as quietly as she could around the bank, taking care not to slip on the
wet grass. Seeing a gap ahead, she stopped, crouched down, and shuffled
forward for the last few metres. When she peered over the edge. she
found herself looking into the eyes of a man. He was huge, his head
almost level with Sam's feet, despite the two metre plus height of the
bank. His hair was a thick black bush, braided at the sides. For an
instant he just stared at her, his eyes wide with amazement. Then he
hefted a copper-tipped spear and levelled it at Sam's head. She was
trying to think of something to say when from the corner of her eye she
saw the Doctor trotting towards the entrance, across a muddy wooden
bridge, a smile on his face, a hand extended towards the guard.<br>'Good morning,' he said. 'I'm your local Betterware representative. I hope this is a convenient time to call on you.'<br>As
soon as the Doctor started speaking, Sam saw the big man's gaze turn
away from her, and she started moving the way he wouldn't expect her to
move, down, forward, towards the spear, and then ducking aside,
scrambling down the rough, slippery grass behind the giant and into the
open space beyond even as he called out. She could see stones ahead.
Stones, people, and two more enormous men in bear hides with
copper-tipped spears already pointing in her direction. Behind them, a
crowd of people in furs and brown leather, most of them staring at her
wide-eyed and afraid. <br>Ancestors, she thought
desperately.&nbsp;They believe in ancestors. 'I am the ghost of the
Great Mother,' she proclaimed. 'Make way for me.'<br>Amazingly, it
seemed to work. The spear men were frowning, confused, but they were
letting her through, and the crowd behind simply scattered. She could
see the stones ahead, newly cut, smooth sided, glossy with rain. She
walked through the outer ring, saw that it was only half complete.
Lying across the middle of what would be the circle was a fallen stone,
one end surrounded by churned up earth. On top of it stood a deer-like
alien. No, hang on. Remember what century you're in. It was a man
wearing an antler headdress, a deer hide and a deer mask. He was
holding a long bronze dagger. Below him, held down against the fallen
stone by two of the huge spear men, was a young man. When he saw Sam he
struggled and tried to say something, but she couldn't make out any
words. Sam looked from him to the Deer Man and back again. <br>'I am the ghost of the Great Mother,' she said quietly. 'And I demand to know what's happening here.'<br>'Who
are you really?' the Deer Man asked. His voice was shaking slightly,
but Sam couldn't tell whether it was anger, fear or simply surprise.<br>'I am who I am.' she said simply. 'Give me the knife.'<br>For
an instant she thought he was going to do it. The hand holding the
knife started to move cautiously. But then the man froze. Behind Sam,
another voice roared.<br>'No!'<br>She turned to see a huge man in bear
skins stepping through the gap between two stones. He carried a wooden
staff and wore a breastplate that looked like solid gold. He stared at
her without any fear at all. In fact, he seemed to be amused.<br>'I am who I am, too,' he said, then he strolled up to her and grabbed her arm in a painfully tight grip. <br>Sam
felt a lurch of panic, but managed to restrain her instinct to
struggle. She had to make it look as though she was in control, even if
she wasn't. She looked up at the man with the knife and the antlers.<br>'This ceremony is wrong. You know it's wrong. You must stop it now.'<br>'Or else what, woman?' said the man holding her, twisting her arm painfully.<br>'The spirit of,' what had she called herself? 'Great Mother will'<br>There
was a loud bang, and the sky went red. Even the big man was frightened
this time. He released Sam's arm and drew a spear, then just looked up
in awe.<br>'The sun,' bawled someone. 'The sun is angry with us.'<br>Sam
grinned. She could see the bright red ball of the flare overhead, the
trail of white smoke behind it. 'Good timing, Doctor.' she thought. For
the first time she noticed that the young victim's arm was broken, the
bone protruding from the skin. Blood leaked from the wound. <br>The
flare died, leaving relative darkness. Quickly, before anyone could get
over their surprise, she marched the few remaining metres to the centre
of the temple and grabbed the victim. <br>'Come with me,' she said.<br>He
didn't move, instead staring down at a point about half way along the
side of the fallen stone. With a shock, Sam realised that he was
younger than her, perhaps about fourteen or fifteen. His blond hair, a
complex pattern of braids, had become tangled, drenched with sweat. <br>Sam heard the big man bellowing at someone and she pulled again at the young victim. <br>'Come on!'<br>At last he seemed to get the point, and let her lead him away.<br><br>Coyn
hadn't understood, as usual. Shalin had seen the man dressed in summer
green even before the explosion and the light. He's seen the aura of
confidence and the power around him, too. The woman wasn't important.
She was just carrying out his orders. As soon as the light faded,
Shalin left the fallen stone and Coyn's abortive sacrifice, and jogged
towards the stranger. Everyone else was screaming, struggling to get
out. Even the Bear Men seemed afraid and confused. Shalin wasn't
afraid, exactly. Instead he felt a curious sense of anticipation. As he
drew closer, the stranger saw him and their eyes met.<br>'Ah, just the man I wanted to see,' he said.<br>'Yes,' said Shalin. 'I think we should talk.'<br>He
approached the man, lifted his antlered mask away from his face, then
brought the sharp wooden chin of the mask down on the Doctor's head.
Then he hit him again, and watched with satisfaction as the Doctor
dropped to the ground. <br><br>Once they were through the wall of
sarsens, Sam could see that everyone was crowded around the entrance,
shouting, panicking, trying to get out. Some had climbed the bank and
were struggling to climb the razor picket on top. She saw a woman with
blood streaming down her face. They were terrified. She looked around
for the Doctor, but couldn't see him. <br>'Listen, everyone,' she
cried. Slowly the shouting and confusion subsided. 'If you let me go
from here with this man, I'll make sure the.' What could she call it?
'False sun doesn't come back, okay?'<br>The young man was now leaning
against her, stinking of sweat and panic. She could hear his breathing,
ragged, slow. He must be in shock, about to collapse. She'd never get
him to the Tardis.<br>'No!' That bear-like roar again. 'Keep her here.'<br>Sam
heard heavy footsteps behind her, and hauled the boy off to the
entrance at a run. People scattered in front of her. She ran through,
crossing the muddy wooden planking that crossed the ditch. She heard
the Great Bear roaring behind her, then another voice calling him. She
heard the young victim's breathing now coming in big unstable whoops.<br>'He's going to faint. Doctor, where are you?'<br>She
stared around the dawn landscape, the brown causeways,&nbsp;the dark
barrows, the criss-crossing lines of posts, but the Doctor was nowhere
to be seen. <br><br>Coyn stared down at the strange figure on the ground. There was a bruise spreading across his face where Shalin had hit him.<br>'You say this is their leader?' he said to Shalin.<br>'Yes, I'm sure of it. He has the real power. The woman was his tool. Perhaps she is his wife or his acolyte.'<br>Coyn was pushing at the bruise on the Doctor's forehead with the toe of his boot.<br>'He's just a man wearing strange clothes.'<br>Shalin
watched the Doctor breathing, watched the strange shine on his cloak.
Coyn must be aware of the special nature of this man, but he probably
thought it would look weak to show his fear. Very well then, he would
play to the other aspect of the Doctor's power.<br>'He made the sky red,' he observed. 'That's a trick we could use in war.'<br>'Yes.'
Coyn's hand descended on Shalin's shoulder. 'Your thinking is as clear
as it ever was, my friend. Find out how he did it, so that we can do it
too. Kill him afterwards, unless you think we need him. I'm going to
see if I can find the other one.'<br>Hefting his spear, he nodded at
his escort of Bear Men. They set off to the old south entrance to the
temple at a fast trot, scattering the crowd before them. <br>Shalin watched him go. Kill him afterwards? Did Coyn respect nothing? Shalin knelt down at the Doctor's side.<br>'Wake
up,' he said quietly. 'We can have that talk now, I think.' He glanced
up at Coyn's party, disappearing through the entrance. 'In private.'<br><br>Dorlan's
strength was almost gone by the time they reached the edge of the
eastern wood. He stared at the dripping fringe of the trees, aware that
his body was swaying despite all his efforts to stand still. His legs
trembled and his arm was a burning mass of pain and sickness. His
rescuer looked back. <br>'Come on. It's not much further.'<br>Dorlan
still couldn't understand where they were going. All the land here
belonged to the Great Bear and his people. They knew all the trails.<br>'We'll need to get much further from the temple to be safe,' he said.<br>'Save
your strength for running,' said the woman. 'I know where we're going.
You'll be safe. There's food and water, and we might be able to fix
your arm.'<br>Fix? Dorlan knew that broken limbs could be splinted.
With luck he might be able to use his arm in the future, at least for
light tasks. But he knew he would never use a bow again, if he survived
at all. He looked back at the confused, mystic landscape, striped and
distorted by the Bear people's endless causeways and monuments. Two of
the Bear Men were still in pursuit, though they were some distance
behind. But they knew the land, and had endurance. How much longer
could he and this woman stay ahead? His rescuer grabbed hold of his uninjured arm. Even that contact made him wince. <br>'Come on! '<br>She
kept saying that. He wished he understood where they were going. They
jogged into the shelter of the woods, quickly straying off the obvious
paths into an area dense with beech and oak, where the ground was
thickly littered with wet leaves. The woman held onto Dorlan's arm,
perhaps worried that he might fall. Then, ahead, he saw a totem post,
higher than a man, square, with the girth of a tree. It was made of
wood stained in a blue pigment. It was covered in carvings and
mysterious grid lines, and huge straight-edged jewels. Dorlan had never
seen anything like it before. He stopped, shivering. <br>'Who are
you?' he asked the woman. She ignored his question. She was touching
the surface of the post. For the first time, Dorlan had a change to
really take in her strangeness. The clothing, the impossible bright red
cloth on her legs, the sea-blue cloak, her shoes apple blossom white
under their coating of mud. <br>'Your clothes are the colours of
flowers,' he said. 'Are you a Spring spirit?' It hadn't occured to him
before that she might not be human. He'd never met a spirit, but he had
been about to die. Ahead of him a door opened in the totem post. Light
streamed out into the dim winter forest. The woman stepped inside and
vanished. He heard her voice from inside.<br>'Come on!'<br>Dorlan
hesitated. It was obvious that the door led to some other world. So his
rescuer wasn't human, which meant she might do anything. Perhaps he was
already dead and this was his first test in the spirit world. But he
didn't remember dying. He didn't feel any different. And this was
nothing like any of the stories he'd heard. And his arm hurt. Surely it
wouldn't hurt so much if he was dead. He stood, shivering, uncertain,
his legs unsteady beneath him. Then he became aware of sounds behind
him. Steps in the forest. The tread of heavy men trying to be quiet.
The Bear Men. Then the woman was in front of him again, a concerned
expression on her face.<br>'All right,' she said, 'take my hand. I'll lead you through the door.'<br>Dorlan realised that he hadn't any choice but to go along with her.<br><br>Inside,
the space and light made him blink, and the air was warm. Warm and dry
like a summer's day. He looked around, saw a carved hearth with a few
small lights burning, but there was no fire, no smoke. The immense
space around it was filled with totems and things that might be tools.
Many of them, like the woman's clothing, had the bright colours of
flowers, of fruit. Others looked like metals. Dorlan gaped. He hadn't
known that there was so much metal in the world. The woman, spirit, was
calling out.<br>'Doctor! Doctor, where are you? I need your help with' She turned to him. 'What's your name?'<br>'Dorlan. Who are you looking for? Is he a man dressed in strange clothes like you?'<br>The woman laughed. Light, gentle, almost a girl's laughter. But she was at least as old as Dorlan.<br>'Yes, that's him,' she said. 'Everyone thinks his clothes are strange wherever we go.'<br>'There was a man dressed in the green of leaves at the temple.'<br>'You saw him?'<br>'He was lying at the feet of the Deer Man when we left.'<br>'Lying at his feet?'<br>Dorlan
sensed her sudden fear and immediately felt afraid too. He looked
nervously at the door behind them, but it was shut. Could the Bear Men
force their way through? The woman had advanced on him. <br>'What happened to him? Why didn't you tell me?'<br>'I didn't know he was your friend. I didn't know anything.' said Dorlan, miserably. 'I still don't. I'm sorry.' <br>He felt his body begin to tremble. The shaking sent a bolt of pain through his arm. To his shame his eyes misted with tears.<br>'I'm sorry,' he repeated. 'Are we going to die?'<br>The
woman sighed. Now she looked much older, as if a burden had descended
on her shoulders, and Dorlan knew why. Responsibility. She had saved
his life. Now she was responsible for him in this strange world.<br>'I
don't want to be a burden to you,' he said. 'If there is anything I can
do, tell me. I am a Chieftain of my people. I have been trained in many
skills.'<br>She met his eyes then put a hand out and touched his
shoulder softly. He knew then that she wasn't a spirit, however strange
her world.<br>'Don't worry about it,' she said. 'The Doctor will be
okay. He can look after himself. Come on, let's see what I can do to
fix up your arm.'<br><br>Shalin looked hard at the Doctor. 'Are you a god?'<br>'Ah. I wondered when you'd get round to asking me that one. No, sorry, I'm not. I haven't even got his phone number any more.' <br>The stranger flashed Shalin a disconcerting smile. The Deer Man wondered what a phone number was. Some kind of totem?<br>'Good,'
he said aloud. 'I knew that, of course, but I wanted to see if you
would lie about it.' He met the Doctor's eyes, paused to let his remark
sink in. 'Now, how did you make the fire in the sky?'<br>The Doctor
propped himself up on one elbow and looked around the hut. His eyes
rested for a moment on the place where one of Coyn's Bear Men stood,
the southern bronze of his axe gleaming in&nbsp;the daylight seeping in
through the hides hung over the entrance. Then his gaze moved on to the
totems of the conquered tribes laid out on the wall, each one splashed
with the brown faded blood of one of their warriors killed in battle.
Finally he looked at Shalin again.<br>'What an interesting collection.
You haven't got the mountain lake people yet, I see. I suppose they're
on next year's conquest list, or the year after. You have got lists, I
suppose? You look like the kind of man who'd make lists of the people
he kills.'<br>'I don't kill them,' said Shalin. 'Warriors kill. I am the Deer Man.'<br>'Oh,
so when you had the knife poised above that young man out
there,&nbsp;you were just trying to frighten him, were you? Or was it a
game? Follow the knife.'<br>The Doctor stood up, brought his face close to Shalin's.<br>'How about, guess where I'm going to stab you.'<br>Shalin
jumped backwards, and at the same time the Bear Man leapt away from the
door, axe raised. Shalin saw that the Doctor had no knife and signalled
the Bear Man to stay where he was. The stranger didn't even seem to
have noticed the threat. His eyes were still fixed on Shalin's, full of
accusation and anger.<br>'Yes, I can see,' said the Doctor. 'You're a
coward. Most people who kill from lists are cowards. I almost prefer
the other sort.' Now he did glance at the Bear Man who was still
hovering with his axe. 'At least you know where you are with them.' He
relaxed, stepped back from Shalin. 'Come on, Shalin. I'm not giving you
any fire in the sky, so you can forget it. Why not just let me go?'<br>Shalin
started at the use of his given name. How had the stranger known that?
It was obviously another indication of his power. And his power meant.<br>'I have my own reasons for talking to you,' he said.<br>The
Doctor just looked at him. Shalin gestured to the Bear Man to wait
outside. When he was gone, he said quietly to the Doctor, 'You are the
only man I know who has more power than Coyn.'<br>'And?' said the Doctor.<br>Shalin
shook his head. 'Coyn is insane. He wants the stone temple completed in
his lifetime, in his honour. He wants to be a god in the afterlife.'<br>The Doctor nodded. 'The Pharaoh syndrome. I've met it before.'<br>Shalin
didn't understand the Doctor's words, didn't care much. This was the
first time he'd been able to unburden himself about Coyn to anyone for
years.<br>'He wasn't always like this. To start with it was just a
dream, to rebuild the great temple in stone. But first he killed his
brother so that he could be chief, and then he conquered the sacred
people who lived here, so that we could do what we liked with the
temple. Then Coyn wanted stones from everywhere. It has to be the
greatest temple in the world, he said. We want stones from all over the
world. He wanted Sarsens from the old temple plain, so we had to
conquer the people there, kill half of them, build trackways, drag the
stones three days walk across the land. He wanted stones that were
already holy, so we had to conquer the hill people across the water.
Doctor, he just doesn't understand that there are any limits. He's
going to destroy every hearth in the land, in all the lands, just to
build this temple.' He lowered his voice. 'And he surrounds himself
with those Bear Men. They're not even our people, don't even speak our
language. He got them from the south somewhere.'<br>'Yes,' said the
Doctor. 'That must be difficult. But it's quite common with those sorts
of people, importing strangers as personal guardians. I remember the
Emperor Caligula.' <br>He trailed off, staring at the entrance to the hut. <br>Shalin looked around nervously, but nothing moved. He turned back to the Doctor. 'I need your help,' he said.<br>The
Doctor took&nbsp;hold of Shalin's shoulders, looked into his eyes, a
clear blue disconcerting gaze. 'Have you seriously tried talking to
this Coyn?' he asked.<br>Shalin shook his head. 'We've been friends
since childhood,' he said, 'but he doesn't listen any more.' He almost
added, he never did, then thought better of it. The Doctor would
probably accuse him of a lack of foresight, and he would probably be
right. Coyn's flaws of character were, after all, obvious.<br>'Well, I'll talk to him, then.' said the Doctor. <br>He let go, started to turn away, but Shalin grabbed hold of the Doctor's arm. <br>'It
won't work.' he said. 'I've tried. There's only one way to stop Coyn.'
He touched the bronze dagger at his belt. 'I want you to help me do
that.' <br>He had to be indirect. He didn't want to risk using the
work kill. The Bear Man was still outside, he might hear, he might
understand.<br>'Certainly not,' said the Doctor. 'There's been enough killing around here already.'<br>He
snatched himself away, but before he could reach the hides covering the
doorway, they were flung back from outside and daylight flooded in.<br>'Stranger.' Coyn's voice. Shalin felt his body freeze with terror. How much had Coyn heard?<br>'You
are clearly a powerful man, Doctor,' Coyn went on, striding towards
them. 'I believe I can come to an arrangement with you, but there's
something I must do first.'<br>'No!' cried the Doctor. 'You don't understand.'<br>Shalin
started to turn, felt a powerful fist thud into his back, pitching him
forward. He saw the Doctor staring, an expression of horror on his
face. Then he saw the long shaft of the spear protruding from his own
chest, the copper blade covered in blood. The pain bit into him and he
tried to scream, but his breath was gone. He fell to his knees, then
the ground seemed to roll upwards and hit him. He heard the Doctor's
furious voice.<br>'He didn't really want to kill you, Coyn! He was just afraid of you! This could all have been sorted out.'<br>Then
the Doctor was kneeling over him. His face seemed to glow from within.
So he was a god after all Shalin wanted to ask where he would go after
he died, whether he would be punished for what he had done, but his
throat was clotted with blood. The Doctor's hand touched his face, and
he died.<br><br>Sam wasn't sure whether she'd set Dorlan's arm
properly. She'd done her best, following the instructions in the Tardis
medical kit. It had provided her with x-rays and told her where to
grip, how much pressure to apply, but it couldn't set the bone for her.
It looked all right, but. Dorlan hadn't quite lost consciousness.
Painkillers from the kit had helped. Sam suspected that sheer
determination and not a little sense of wonder had kept him from
fainting. Even when the fluid cast from the kit had been crawling over
his bruised skin, he'd been staring, bug-eyed, around the console room.
Mostly at the console itself, but also at the library shelves, the
record collection, and the Volkswagen Beetle still parked in a corner,
all of which he seemed to regard as equally marvellous. Now the cast
had set and he was holding the Doctor's empty cocoa mug in his left
hand, turning it over and over.<br>'I've never seen pottery so fine,'
he said. 'It's so smooth, it's like a stone in a river. And the
colour.' The mug was Post Office red.<br>'It's the Doctor's,' said Sam. <br>'The one who made the sky red?' <br>Sam nodded.<br>'Is red his sacred colour, then?'<br>Sam managed to suppress a giggle, then saw that Dorlan was smiling at her anyway.<br>'He hasn't got a sacred colour,' she said, grinning back. 'I think he just likes colours in general.'<br>She
walked over to the console, switched on the viewscreen, looked outside.
One of the Bear Men was still standing guard. The other had gone,
presumably to fetch reinforcements.<br>'Well, let them try to get inside the Tardis.'<br>She noticed that Dorlan was staring anxiously at the screen. <br>'They're not inside, are they?' he asked.<br>'It's
only an image,' said Sam. 'I control it.' She turned it off. Then she
met his eyes and said quietly, 'Dorlan, why were you going to be
killed?'<br>She listened as he told her, asking questions now and then,
feeling her sense of outrage grow as the story of injustice, conquest
and slavery built up. So this was how Stonehenge had been built. Stones
dragged across the countryside at the cost of lives. Slaves digging
pits at the point of spears. Suddenly the stones didn't seem magical
any more, not when the secret of their building was human misery and
death on this scale.<br>'We're going to do something about this,' she said at the end. 'Your people can't go on suffering like this.'<br>'What can we do?' asked Dorlan. 'Do you have spears here?'<br>'No. No weapons. This is the Tardis.' she said.<br>'If there are no weapons, how can you oppose Coyn?'<br>Sam
thought for a moment. There had to be a way to convince Coyn that what
he was doing was wrong. Or better, that the gods were against him.
Suddenly she thought of something. It was so obvious that it was almost
funny. She grinned at Dorlan.<br>'Wait here. I think I know a way.'<br><br>Coyn,
Chieftain of the Bear people, and in addition the Great High Supreme
Chieftain and King, Lord of all the lands and all the peoples, stood on
the embankment around his stone temple, looked at the lowering grey
clouds, at the lashing rain, and scowled. The day had been bad from the
start. The fallen stone, the strange visitors, the aborted sacrifice,
and now his friend was dead. And I killed him. He had known it was
coming, this death. His old friend had been too powerful for too long.
But he hadn't thought that it would come so soon, and he hadn't
imagined it would feel as terrible as this. He saw some of Dorlan's
people peering at him from outside the embankment. He waved his spear
at them and shouted. Even though they were almost at the limit of a
spear's throw, they still cowered. He waved the spear again. They
turned and started to run away. Shalin had always said make them afraid
of you and they'll do what you want. <br>'Perhaps you should have been more afraid of me, my friend,' he muttered.<br>'He was afraid,' said a voice behind him. 'That was the problem with him.'<br>Coyn
turned, and glared at the Doctor, trying not to show his disquiet. The
stranger had been able to creep up on him unheard. That should be
impossible, especially in those strange, heavy shoes.&nbsp;Whatever he
was, the Doctor had powers beyond anything Coyn understood, or wanted
to understand. He wondered if it was the stranger's power that had
caused the stone to fall in the first place. If everything that had
happened today had been a demonstration of that power? Well, there was
only one way to find out.<br>'I should kill you too,' he said, letting the spear fall so that its point was level with the Doctor's chest.<br>'But you're afraid,' said the Doctor, infuriatingly calm.<br>Coyn
shook his head. 'Not afraid,' he said. To show weakness in front of
this being would probably be his last mistake. 'But it's clear that you
have power, or at least some useful tricks. Your people must have
power, too. I'd rather bargain with you than invite their anger.'<br>'Yes,
and it's a shame you didn't think of that before killing Shalin, isn't
it?' said the Doctor. 'I mean, what do you think his spirit's thinking
about you now? Not to mention his ancestors.'<br>Coyn shuddered. 'I
keep feeling the spear going through my friend's body. I keep wishing
it hadn't happened, but he said he was going to kill me, and he was
going to use your power against me.<br>The Doctor shook his head. 'I wouldn't have let him do that. But have you wondered why he wanted to kill you?'<br>'I
don't need to know why. No one threatens me.' Coyn pushed his face
close to the other man's, tightening his expression into a mask of
anger. <br>This usually terrified men, but it had no effect on the
Doctor. All he said was, 'That's it, exactly. No one's allowed to
threaten you, are they. To question you, to argue with your judgment.
You want this temple finished in your lifetime. You keep coming up with
grander and grander schemes, most of which are absolutely impossible,
and you don't care how many people die to get things done.' <br>The Doctor's anger was clear. His eyes seemed to be ablaze with it. Coyn stood back, feeling his heart thud in his chest.<br>'Do
you think the only way to stop me is to kill me?' he said at last. The
question had to be asked. If he was going to die he wanted to know it
was coming.<br>The Doctor waited a while before speaking, still looking
into Coyn's eyes as if he were measuring something. 'Maybe,' he said
eventually, 'but I'm not as precipitate as you.'<br>Coyn looked over
the temple, along the great ceremonial way that led to it, two high
banks of earth topped by lines of totem posts. <br>'Shalin was going
to place stones along those banks,' he said. 'He said it would increase
the power of the temple. You say I only cared about the temple, Doctor,
but it was Shalin who told me what was needed.'<br>'You blame Shalin,
he blamed you. Look, don't you think it's time this obsession with
stones and power stopped? People are dying because of it.'<br>'People die anyway. It's the afterlife that matters.' He raised his voice. 'I will be a god.' <br>'Shalin said that too, did he?' asked the Doctor.<br>Coyn
frowned. Did everything he believed in come from Shalin? He'd never
thought of it that way. His ideas were his, but they had to come from
somewhere.<br>'Look,' said the Doctor, interrupting his confused
thoughts. 'Why don't you try something? Release the boy Dorlan, and all
his people. Escort them home with whatever food you can spare. Don't
use conquered people any more. There are plenty of your own people who
would work on the temple willingly in the slack season.'<br>'Shalin says,' began Coyn, then he realised what he was saying. <br>'Shalin's dead.'<br>Coyn
turned away from the Doctor and walked along the bank, staring into the
temple, into the rain, not sure whether he was thinking or acting, or
just mourning his friend. A bird landed on one of the stones, brown and
white. For a moment Coyn thought it was a baby seagull, but then he saw
that it was a hawk. Sacrifices, he thought. Who told me that there had
to be sacrifices? It was you, my old friend. Well, now you've joined
them.<br>At last Coyn returned to where the Doctor stood waiting. 'I
will free Dorlan's people,' he said. 'I will ask my own people to work
on the temple and see what happens, until the winter solstice next
year. After that time I will be free to make my own decisions once
more.' He paused. 'In return, you and the woman you brought will leave
my land and never return.'<br>The Doctor met his eyes. 'Accepted,' he
said, then added quietly, 'Maybe no one has to kill you to stop you,
Coyn. Maybe you just need good advice.'<br><br>Dorlan looked at the
strange object that Sam had called an aerosol can. It was like a pot, a
long drinking pot, but there was nowhere to drink from it. It was cold
in his hand and it looked and felt as if it was wet, but in fact it was
dry. It left no moisture on his hand. Its strangeness was frightening,
but Dorlan wasn't going to show that fear, not in front of this woman
who'd helped him. He told himself that the cast on his arm was just as
strange, and it didn't hurt him. It did just the opposite.<br>'Turn the
button on top so that the arrowhead points away from you,' instructed
Sam. She was standing with a sheet of white material in her hands,
spread out across the front of her body. The material looked like a
sort of cloth. She called it paper. Dorlan looked down at the can he
was holding, at the knob of finely ridged, bone-like material on the
top, and saw the arrowhead. It was a tiny, intricate carving which must
have taken many hours of work. There were many things like it in the
hearth place that Sam called the Tardis. Sam had yet to explain where
all the people were that laboured to make these things.<br>'The arrow's pointing away from me,' he told Sam.<br>'Right. Now press the button.'<br>Dorlan
pushed. The hissing sound made him jump, even though he'd heard it when
Sam had used the aerosol. Determinedly he held onto the thing, watching
as the white sheet in front of Sam turned blue.<br>'Turn it a little as you spray.'<br>Dorlan turned the can, watched a blue stripe form on the paper, creeping towards the edge. He turned the can a bit more.<br>'Ouch! Careful.'<br>Sam
danced out of the way as the blue colour spread to her hand and her
shirt. She was grinning. But when he turned the can towards her
deliberately and made as if to press the button again, the grin died.
'No, it's not that funny, Dorlan. You've really got to be careful not
to spray it at anyone. Especially not in their faces. You could blind
someone.'<br>Dorlan nodded. 'It's powerful?'<br>'Well, it's dangerous,' said Sam.<br>'And it will make Coyn let my people go?'<br>'It's a matter of showing them you have power,' said Sam. <br>She
was loading the other cans into a backpack. The carved tops showed
their colours, sea blue, sky blue, green, orange, yellow. There was
even one that shone a little like gold. <br>With the aerosols packed,
she turned to him. 'If Coyn wakes up tomorrow morning and the whole
temple's covered in stuff like this.' She gestured at the white sheet
covered in coloured paint. 'He's going to realise that you've got some
powerful friends.'<br>'With any luck he'll think we're gods, especially
after the Doctor's display yesterday. Then he'll think twice about
doing anything to the Doctor and about keeping your people in slavery.'<br>Dorlan
wasn't sure about this. Coyn was a determined man, insanely determined,
but. He looked at the aerosol he was holding, remembering what Sam had
said about it being dangerous to the eyes. She'd certainly got out of
the way quickly enough. Yes, it might work. Sam was standing by the
hearth now, fiddling with a small, brightly coloured tube. A flame lit
near the end of it, and for the first time in the Tardis, Dorlan smelt
smoke.<br>'A distraction,' she said. 'If it worked for the Doctor, it should work for me.'<br>Dorlan
nodded, though he didn't understand. She touched something on the
hearth and there was a sound like a stick breaking. Dorlan felt a
breath of cold, damp air, turned to see that the Tardis doors had
opened. He could see the back of the Bear Man standing guard outside.
Sam ran past him, the sputtering torch in her hand.<br>'Geronimo!'<br>Dorlan
wondered why she was shouting, then he could see the Bear Man staring
in through the door, surprised and confused. That wouldn't last long.
Dorlan started to rush forward, lifting the aerosol, then lightning
struck outside. A flash, an ear-splitting bang. Dorlan guessed it was
Sam's device and ignored it. The Bear Man was more alarmed and looked
over his shoulder, but quickly looked back again. He saw Dorlan and
raised his spear.<br>'Dorlan!' yelled Sam, 'Get back. I'll close the door.'<br>Just
for a moment the Bear Man's gaze flicked to her. In that moment, Dorlan
jumped, dodging the spear, pressing the knob on the aerosol and aiming
the tiny arrow at the Bear Man's eyes. They were looking at Dorlan when
the paint hit them. The Bear Man grunted, brought his hands up to his
eyes. The spear fell, brushing Dorlan's hip. He made a grab for it,
missed. From the corner of his eye he saw the Bear Man trying to draw
his bronze dagger one handed, the other hand still tearing at his eyes.
He was starting to scream, a surprisingly high wail of pain.<br>'Dorlan, we'll have to wash that out of his eyes!'<br>Dorlan
wondered what Sam could be talking about. They needed to kill the Bear
Man, not wash his eyes. Perhaps she didn't like killing. Women usually
didn't. He had the spear now, though he'd had to drop the aerosol. It
was heavy, but his muscles were strong from all that hauling on stones
and he managed to lift it with his good arm. <br>'No, Dorlan.'<br>Dorlan
knew that he couldn't afford to listen to Sam. He drove the spear
clumsily into the Bear Man's side. The man screamed again, but Dorlan
wasn't sure he'd done any real damage. He'd never killed a man before.
The spear was heavy, the bear hide thick and tough. Dorlan tried to
pull the spear back for another go, couldn't. The Bear Man grabbed the
weapon and wrenched it out of Dorlan's grasp. He held onto it, feeling
his way along the haft to the point embedded in his clothing. Dorlan
could see some blood there, but he wasn't sure it was enough. <br>'Sam!' bawled Dorlan. 'You'll have to help me.'<br>But
Sam was shouting something about having found some rope, something that
didn't make any sense. She was trying to get close, which was
dangerous. The haft of the spear was flying around as the Bear Man
tried to pull it loose. Then Dorlan saw the bronze dagger. It was half
out of the scabbard. He kicked out, catching the top. The big man felt
the impact, but Dorlan was back out of range by the time he'd
responded. It was clear that he couldn't see. His face was covered with
the shiny blue pigment. Suddenly, the dagger clattered to the floor.
Dorlan dived in, grabbed it, reached up and stabbed the man in the base
of his throat where he wasn't protected by the thick leather&nbsp;of
the hide. He was rewarded with a gout of blood as he withdrew the
knife. He jumped back to avoid the flailing arms and legs of the dying
man.<br>'Don't kill him!' shouted Sam.<br>'I already have,' said
Dorlan, puzzled by her strange behaviour. She seemed so knowledgeable in
other ways. Had she never seen anything killed before? <br>The Bear
Man crashed to the floor, half in and half out of the Tardis. He was
still breathing, but they were the broken gasps of a dying animal.<br>'Satisfied?'<br>Dorlan
pushed the bloodied dagger into his belt, lifted the spear with his
good arm. Then he put it down and grabbed the pack of aerosols,
awkwardly shuffling it onto his back. They weren't as good as knives or
spears, but they were still weapons, and they were all he had. His
people could use them.<br>'You'd better stay here,' he said, looking at
the white-faced Sam as he picked up the spear again. She was obviously
going to be no use in battle. 'Keep your hearth for your kinsman. I
will tell him you are here when I find him.' Then he stepped over the
Bear Man and ran into the forest.<br><br>The
short winter day was almost over when Coyn's party reached the fringes
of the wood. The light of the lanterns carried by the Bear Men through
long shadows across the leaf litter and the pale trunks of the trees.
Coyn thought he saw a glimpse of red deer hide in the weak, shifting
light of the flames. He shivered. Shalin had often walked in this part
of the wood, gathering his herbs and potions. What if his angry spirit
walked there now? But the Doctor simply went in, unafraid, and Coyn had
no choice but to follow. He waved the Bear Men after him. The Doctor
led the way, though the Bear Men with them also followed the trail that
had been left earlier, reading the marks on the forest floor by the
light of their lanterns. At last they came to the Doctor's totem place.
It frightened Coyn. A blue colour he'd never seen before, dark as an
evening sea, carved and set with squares of ice. It seemed somehow
alive in the light of the flames. <br>One of the Bear Men called out
'Here!' Coyn turned and followed the voice, and saw the man's body on
the ground, stained with dark blood. The trail led to the Doctor's
totem. Coyn whirled round to face the Doctor, in the same movement
pulling his bow from his back, loading an arrow.<br>'No, Coyn. Sam wouldn't.'<br>Coyn took aim at the Doctor. <br>'It doesn't look as if your companion is interested in making agreements, Doctor.'<br>'She wouldn't deliberately kill anyone,' said the Doctor, quickly. 'I'm sure this man was killed by someone else.'<br>'He was my kinsman and now he's dead!' roared Coyn. 'And it's the doing of your woman!'<br>But
as usual his anger had no effect on the Doctor. The stranger spoke
calmly. 'Even if that was true, we're just going to have to stop her,
Coyn, before she does any more damage. That's all.'<br>'You're going to have to stop her, Doctor,' said Coyn. 'If you don't, our agreement is over. I will kill both of you.'<br><br>Gasping
for breath, Sam crouched on the wet grass. A few metres away across a
ditch was the stockade surrounding the great temple. Once she'd
realised that the Bear Man was dead, she'd run as fast as she could in
the fading light, pushing her way through lines of posts, wading
through a stinking ditch, almost falling into an unexpected hole in the
ground hidden in clumps of long grass. And she was too late. Dorlan was
standing by a gap in the fence. Behind him were some other people
carrying crude weapons. Wooden stakes, sharp edged pieces of broken
pottery, lump of stone. Some of them had aerosols. Two were carrying
spears which probably meant two dead Bear Men. She could see some huts
inside a stockade burning, people throwing brands at unseen attackers.
One of Dorlan's people shouted, pointed, and Dorlan looked down.<br>'Sam!' he shouted.<br>'Don't kill anyone else,' she shouted back. 'Please!'<br>'Why not?' Dorlan's puzzlement was obviously genuine. 'If we don't they'll kill us.'<br>His people were already piling through the broken stockades towards the stones of the temple.<br>'If
you kill any more of them, the aerosols won't work.' Sam yelled after
him, but she wasn't sure he'd heard. She saw more Bear Men running
across the plain from a nearby settlement, carrying lanterns and
weapons. Some stopped, knelt. Arrows started to fly. Shakily she sat
down on the grass. The Doctor was right, she thought. I didn't
understand. Dorlan is no better than Coyn. I haven't helped anyone. I
haven't even saved anyone. I've just started a war. <br><br>Dorlan
watched as his father's brother, Teln, and the other hunters slammed
the last piece of wood down into the crude barricade across the
entrance to the temple. He heard the whoop of arrows in the air, saw
them rain down around the stones. There was a clatter of arrowheads
bouncing off the hard surfaces, then silence.<br>'This isn't going to
work,' hissed Teln. 'We can't escape from here, and we can't fight.
There aren't enough of us and we haven't enough weapons.'<br>He
gestured round at the small band of hunters. Three had spears, the rest
just had sticks and the aerosol cans from the Tardis. <br>Dorlan
lifted one of the cans and sprayed a long plume into the air. 'This
will destroy their strength. It's a sort of magic of Sam's people. We
have to spray it on the stones, and they will believe that their gods
have turned against them to favour us.' But now away from Sam and the
strange magic of the Tardis, that didn't seem so convincing, even to
Dorlan. <br>Teln was shaking his head. 'I still don't believe it. But
now we're here, there's nothing else to try.' He glanced around the
darkening enclosure as if afraid that the stones might come to life.
Dorlan knew that he had to get the magic working quickly. He walked to
the nearest stone and sprayed a trail of red paint across it. Slowly
the others began to follow suit. Lines, squares, axes, the zig-zag
water sign of the northern river people, all blossomed on the stones in
the fading light. Then Dorlan heard a woman's voice shouting. Sam. He
could see her for a moment, scrambling over the stockade on top of the
embankment, silhouetted against the light. Light from the lanterns of
the Bear Men who were climbing the embankment behind her. <br>'They're
attacking!' shouted Sam again, unnecessarily. An arrow flickered past
her, then she dropped, rolled down the bank, ran across the grass. 'I
can't find the Doctor! I don't know what to do,' she said.<br>Dorlan could hear wood cracking as the Bear men forced their way through the barricades.<br>'The paint!' he shouted at Sam. 'Why isn't the paint stopping them?'<br>Sam gazed at him, bewildered. 'What?'<br>'You said the paint would stop them, that it would make them think their gods were against them.'<br>'It. You mean.' Her face twisted. 'Not until they <i>see</i> it. We've made our point. We've got to get out of here.'<br>Dorlan
turned, saw that the Bear Men, many more than the hunters, had already
shut off both entrances and were advancing, some carrying spears,
others bows.<br>'There's nowhere to run,' whispered Dorlan. <br>An
arrow landed between him and Sam, almost hitting her left foot. She
jumped, looked round, seemed to realise what was happening.<br>'There
must be something,' Dorlan began, but he saw the answer in the fear on
her face. There was a yell from behind him. Turning, he saw a hunter on
the ground with the massive shadow of a Bear Man above him. A spear
came down and Dorlan heard the wet crunch of the man's ribs breaking.
He realised that it was Teln. The Bear Man looked up, and for a moment
Dorlan thought he was next. Then he realised the man was looking over
his shoulder. A roaring sound filled the air, great waves of it,
getting steadily louder. Sam's face lit up. <br>'It's the Tardis! It's the Doctor!'<br>Dorlan
turned just in time to see the strange blue totem post materialise in
the pit where the stone had fallen that morning. The door opened and
light flooded out. A huge figure emerged from the totem post, his
golden breast plate glinting in the strange glow. Coyn. And behind him,
the antlered figure of the Deer Man, his eyes pools of shadow in the
dark wooden mask.<br>'Your gods have deserted you,' muttered Dorlan.<br>'The king has returned,' said the Deer Man, 'and we must all abide by his judgment.'<br>Sam
stared, openmouthed, as Coyn beckoned her forward. 'Woman who travels
with the Doctor,' he said, 'did you start this rebellion?'<br>Sam
thought for a moment. If she said no, then the king might blame Dorlan
again and would probably kill him, if not now, then as soon as the
Doctor left. If she said yes, he might want to kill her. But the Doctor
wouldn't let that happen. And she could see the Doctor's trousers and
patent leather shoes projecting from the bottom of the blood-stained
Deer Man costume. Okay then, she was going to have to take the blame.
It wouldn't be the first time. She stepped forward until she was only
an arm's length from Coyn. She'd never been this close to him before,
never realised how physically powerful he was. He could almost&nbsp;<i>be</i>
a bear. Her head was barely level with the top of his breast plate, a
necklace of teeth was in front of her eyes. She felt physically weak
with fear. <br>'I, er, did it,' she made herself say. 'It was my fault. Dorlan's innocent.'<br>Coyn
smiled. Sam felt herself growing angry. She wasn't going to let him get
away with it just like that, just because he was bigger than she was.
Quickly she said, 'Dorlan's people should be free. What you're doing is
unjust.' The blow was totally unexpected. Sam didn't even see Coyn's
arm move. Her head jolted sideways and she was falling, hitting the
hard mud floor of the temple precinct. Coyn's face appeared in front of
hers terrifyingly contorted.<br>'One of my people has died because of you.'<br>Sam
opened her mouth, tasted blood. Coyn just carried on talking. 'I would
kill you, but your friend is powerful and he doesn't like killing. For
the same reason, I will spare Dorlan and his people. But you will
suffer a punishment. You will help the other women dress the bodies of
the dead for the rites of the ancestors. Then you will leave my land
and never return.'<br>After a moment, Sam stood up slowly, shakily,
half expecting another blow from Coyn. But he was walking across the
mud, his shadow growing longer and fainter as he moved away from the
Tardis. She saw him speaking to Dorlan. She turned to the Doctor. <br>'Why did you let him hit me?'<br>'I
didn't know he was going to do it,' said the Doctor. 'Coyn is a very
powerful man, Sam, and he's ruthless. He's already killed one person
today. You'll have to go along with this.'<br>'We could just go,' she said. She looked longingly through the open door of the Tardis. <br>The
Doctor stepped aside, &nbsp;but then said quietly, 'If we do, I'll be
breaking my agreement with him. He'll kill Dorlan. He might kill all of
them.'<br>Sam hesitated. She felt the first pulses of pain from the bruise that must be forming on her face.<br>'Come
on, Sam. It's not so bad. You won't have to do anything much. You don't
know how. Just watch. It might even be interesting.'<br>Sam shuddered.
Then behind her she heard Dorlan whooping with joy, shouting 'We're
free! My people are free!' And she really didn't have any choice at all.<br><br>'I know how Dorlan felt now.'<br>'Hmm?
The Doctor looked up from his book. One of the console room clocks
chimed behind him, a strident repeated trill like a bicycle bell. Sam
waited until the noisy clock had finished before continuing.<br>'He said he felt responsible for his people. He said he felt responsible for Teln's death.'<br>'Yes,
well, people who are chiefs and the like often have a very high sense
of personal responsibility. Individual people, when they're any good,
are often better than committees. I can remember a chat I had with the
Emperor Hadrian once. He wasn't a bad chap. A very good administrator,
in fact. He was going to build a wall along the Rhine as well, but'<br>Sam realised that the Doctor was changing the subject again. She didn't want him to.<br>'I feel responsible for Teln's death.'<br>The Doctor stopped his Roman ramblings mid-sentence and stared at her.<br>'Why?' His surprise looked almost genuine, but Sam knew it wasn't. <br>'I started it, didn't I?' she said. 'The revolution, the war. No one would have died if it hadn't been for that.'<br>She wanted to say more, but to her annoyance found her throat clogging up with tears.<br>'Oh,
Sam.' and the Doctor was kneeling by her side, a buttercup yellow
handkerchief in his hand. 'It wasn't your fault.' He put an arm round
her, began dabbing rather ineffectually at her face. 'Let's
get&nbsp;you a cup of cocoa, then you can go to bed, have a rest, and
you'll feel all right in the morning.'<br>'No, I won't,' snapped Sam. 'I killed two people today.'<br>The Doctor took her hands, looked at her with a serious expression on his face.<br>'No,
you haven't,' he said. 'Dorlan killed one, and the others were killed
in a battle that Dorlan started. What you told him to do might even
have worked. It's not your fault he didn't listen.'<br>Sam took the handkerchief, blew her nose.<br>'You told me not to interfere. I shouldn't have.'<br>'Yes,
well,' he said. He looked down and fiddled with a button on his jacket
as if testing to see whether it was loose or not. 'You did what you
thought was right. There would have been a battle of some sort sooner
or later. Coyn was mad, or nearly mad. Dorlan was strong-minded and
determined. Dorlan and all his people would probably have died before
the winter was out, or fought their way out.'<br>'If Coyn's nearly mad, how do you know he'll keep to the agreement you made?'<br>The
Doctor looked up at the infinite ceiling of the console room. He didn't
speak for a while. 'I don't,' he said finally, then he patted Sam's
hand and smiled. 'We could stop off and look, if you like. Say, ten
years down the line or twenty.'<br>Sam thought about it. 'I'm not sure,' she said finally. <br>The Doctor went back to his chair and picked up his book. ''Well, think about it.&nbsp;Some day, perhaps.'<br>'Some day,' echoed Sam. 'Perhaps.'<br><br>One
old man is sitting on a stone. A flat, low stone in a cleared space
among many other stones. He comes here every day that he can now. Every
day that his strength is enough to leave his hut and be carried here.
He sits facing the north east, facing the place where the sun will rise
next midsummer day. He will not live to see midsummer day, and he knows
it. His attendants are young men. They do not remember the time of
Shalin, of the conquered peoples. They know only that this old man with
his golden breast plate and worn, faded, bearhide cloak, once ruled the
world. They think he is here to glory in his temple, the great work to
which he dedicated his long and tempestuous life. The sound of antler
picks chipping away soil drifts in over the walls of the temple
precinct. Outside, the people are working on a barrow grave for Coyn,
said to be the greatest such monument ever built. But Coyn doesn't care
much for any of that. Not now.<br>The sun bakes the stones and the heat
rises in waves. Flies buzz in the short grass that rings the stones. A
bird sits on one of the totem posts at the entrance. But Coyn sees none
of this. He looks north east, not at the place of the midsummer
sunrise, but at a slight depression in the ground which is all that
remains of the pit where he had been going to place the great stone on
that terrible night so long ago. The stone that killed the girl on the
day that he killed his oldest friend. He has never placed a stone
there, and now he never will. The inner circle of the temple will
remain incomplete for all time. Shalin's monument. But that isn't why
Coyn looks at the remains of the pit. He isn't regretting his life any
more than he's celebrating it. The time for all that has already gone,
now that each breath is so hard. He's remembering the magic, not the
power of it, which was all that he thought about at the time, but the
magic itself. A totem post that appeared and disappeared, and contained
the world inside it. And the man inside that world, a stranger with
strange powers. The only man who ever gave him good advice. <br>So
each day the old bear waits, drawing painful breaths in the baking sun.
He's hoping to see the magic again, one more time before he dies.<br>(Sound of lapping waves and seagulls.)   </font>
