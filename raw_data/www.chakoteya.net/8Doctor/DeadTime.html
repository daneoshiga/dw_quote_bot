Who. Earth and Beyond. <br>
Dead Time, by Andrew Miller<br>
<br><i>Going to die. Going to kill. Who are you?<br></i>I am the Doctor.<br><i>Who are you?<br></i>I am the Doctor! <br><i>You are one of us.<br></i>It
was cold. Freezing. The darkness was so thick and oppressive, the
Doctor found wondering whether the walls and roof were actually
fashioned from it, from patches of night sky resentful that no stars
had ever shone in their confines. He had been standing, rooted to the
spot, for what seemed like an eternity. His senses were dulled with
both pain and the tedium of his incarceration. In this place, the
moments, the minutes, the hours seemed so stretched out that the words
lost all meaning. He felt his face with numbed fingers, reminded
himself of what he was, who he was. And Sam, his companion, his friend,
taken from him and held somewhere out there in the blackness. He could
picture her, growing older as his struggles continued, her blonde hair
turning grey, her wiry body wizening, her clear young skin wrinkling in
this dark and empty place.<br><i>We know you now, Doctor.<br></i>The voice was a mocking whisper. But the loudest whisper he had ever heard, up close in his ears.<br><i>We
are going to use you, to take from you what we need. We have been
waiting so long, so patiently, for someone like you. One of us.<br></i>The sinister voice a low moan of pleasure.<br><i>And
then we are going to kill you, Doctor. We are going to kill you so
slowly, so tenderly, you won't even realise that the moment of your
death has come. We will be cloaked in your memory through the eons
ahead. For the freezing chill that bred this darkness will make you a
monument to us. We'll keep your memory fresh and dead and ours. No one
else's. Ours. Forever.<br></i>The Doctor said nothing. Grey blue eyes
closed and the thin mouth clamped shut. But he knew the whispering
spectre was telling the truth, and he could tell for certain that
whatever was speaking to him was utterly mad.<br><br>Another voice came to him, echoing eerily the void. A girl's voice. Sam's voice. <br>"It's
like being entombed, shut in with only the darkness. It's so black in
here. Oh, Doctor, it's like nothing else has ever existed. Everyone
I've ever known, everywhere I've ever been. It's like all that was just
some kind of dream. It's only when I use clichés like that that I
realise there has to have been something else."<br>"Sam, Sam, are you
all right?" But the mirthless laughter in his ear told him she was
still somewhere else. That he had been allowed only to listen in on her
thoughts for a few moments. The forces here were trying to distract him
while they found some new way of burrowing inside his psychic defences,
reminding him that it was his fault that Sam was helpless in the
blackness. He was the one who had brought her here. Memories, eyes
still tightly shut, though it made no difference to the darkness. He
remembered.<br><br>The Tardis was a long way out, tumbling through
space and time, when the Doctor realised, as was so often the case when
you were a wanderer in the fourth and fifth dimensions, something was
wrong. An insistent beep was coming from somewhere on the wooden
hexagonal console that was the heart of the Tardis's guidance systems.<br>"What is it, Doctor?" asked Sam.<br>"Oh,
the old girl is just being a little over-cautious. We may be in for a
bit of a bumpy ride, that's all. She's telling us something odd's
happening to the time parameters."<br>"What sort of odd?" asked Sam. "What's wrong now?"<br>Things
were always going wrong around the Doctor, and by now she had developed
a kind of Sam Jones Richter scale of danger to measure them against.
The Doctor shrugged. <br>"Ah, well, you know, a freak ripple effect, a Sunersland shift, something along those lines."<br>"Oh, that's all right, then," said Sam, rolling her eyes. <br>Unaware
of the sarcasm, the Doctor seemed genuinely pleased to have put his
friend at ease. "There's really nothing to worry about. It's only if
that red light starts flashing at the same time that we"<br>"This red light?" said Sam, in alarm. <br>As
the Doctor peered at the display Sam was pointing to, an enormous
explosion threw them to the floor of the Tardis. The protesting scream
of over-stretched engines sounded from somewhere deep in the heart of
the ship.<br>"Yes, that's the one." confirmed the Doctor ruefully, as tremors shook through the control room. "Hold on!"<br>The
Tardis vibrated and trembled as if afraid of where it was going. A
klaxon sounded and instrumentation sparked and spluttered around them.
Abruptly the control room was plunged into darkness. Sam cried out
involuntarily. The sound echoed eerily around her then died away into
silence. A chill ran through her. <br>"Listen." she whispered in the gloom. "The Tardis. It's stopped."<br>The
comforting hum of the control room's incredible technology had been
replaced by an oppressive silence. About seven point five on the Jones
Richter scale.<br><br>She
listened as the Doctor's fingers flickered over the controls, sounds
seemingly everywhere at once. In response to his caresses, an eerie
yellow luminescence bled into the grey stone Tardis walls. In the dim
emergency lighting, the Doctor's face was lined with worry. <br>"We're in deep space," he muttered. "Deepest space. There shouldn't be anything out here, not for millions of years."<br>"How can you be sure?" asked Sam.<br>The Doctor scowled. "On my planet, children in nursery know that."<br>Sam
was stung my his reaction, but saw how troubled he looked and walked
over to him, tugging lightly on his coat sleeve. "So where are we?"<br>"I don't know," he replied. <br>"Perhaps
we should ask the nursery children," she enquired with mock politeness.
The Doctor looked set to make a caustic reply, but his face softened
before the words would come out, relaxing into a smile. Sam smiled back
at him. "What time are we in?"<br>The Doctor crossed over to the chronometric display. "We're. How odd." <br>"Deeply peculiar," affirmed Sam, nodding her head authoritatively. "What are you talking about?"<br>The
Doctor was scrutinising some ticker-tape chattering out from a brass
housing. "The readout's shifting. It won't settle." He frowned.
"According to this, we've landed in countless different times all at
once, over a span of thousands of years."<br>Sam frowned. "Is it up the spout? How can we be in different times all at the same time?"<br>"How indeed. Perhaps that's why we've lost power. Simultaneous arrival in hundreds of different time zones." <br>"Like falling into a shredder." whispered Sam.<br>"Precisely. We're lucky to be alive."<br>Sam looked at him as he stared ahead, his face shrouded in shadow. "Is it a trap?"<br>"Perhaps."
Catching her worried look, he smiled. "Or a natural occurrence. There's
always that possibility. In any case, we're rather stuck here until I
can work out if the process is reversible."<br>"And where exactly is here?"<br>The
Doctor shrugged at her as he scrutinised further controls. "No clear
reading of mass. It's certainly not a planet. Seems to be made up of
layers and layers of material the Tardis can't recognise, and yet I
have a feeling"<br>"Some kind of cosmic papier-mâché?" ventured Sam, and to her surprise, the Doctor grinned broadly.<br>"Precisely. But how did they come by so much paste in the middle of a void?"<br>He
activated the scanner, but there was only blackness as the
old-fashioned monitor warmed up to show them the exterior view. They
waited for some time.<br>"Scanner's broken," said Sam.&nbsp;<br>The Doctor took a deep breath. "No. That's what's out there."<br><br><i>We're
going to rip right through you, Doctor. You're going to die. We're
going back. We're going to kill you. Kill you. Kill you.<br></i>The
Doctor felt the whispering demons pulling at his memories, twisting
them, devouring them, attempting to erase them. He stayed calm, eyes
shut, retreating into himself. It was like trying to keep control of a
huge house full of wild children tearing from room to room.&nbsp;What a
pity, he reflected,&nbsp;that his mind contained so many places to
hide. Suddenly the Doctor could hear cries of anguish over the mad
jabbering of the whispering voices. They were coming from Sam. No,
please, let her go. Stop hurting her.<br><i>We're going to kill you. Kill you. Kill you.<br></i>Even
as the Doctor was distracted by Sam's distress, he realised that the
voices in his mind were taking the scraps of thought and memory he was
sacrificing to the battle for control, and building a new image. Pale,
yellow, a bloom of some kind. Flowers, tranquil against a deep indigo
sky that was glittering with stars. He recognised the flowers.
Recognised them from an age long distant, when as a young boy on
Gallifrey he had watched funerals being conducted with pomp and
magnificent ceremony.&nbsp;The flowers, almost invisible at first, so
far were they from the eye, dropped fluttering from the far reaches of
the vast cathedral-like arches of the Panopticon, and onto the crowd of
mourners far below. As a child it had been easy to believe that the
flowers had fallen from heaven itself. They were the Gallifreyan
flowers of remembrance.<br><br>Somewhere in the dark, Sam remembered. "You can't go outside alone, Doctor. You've no idea what's there."<br>"Then I'll find the light switch."<br>"What if you can't breathe?&nbsp;If the controls are giving faulty readouts" <br>"I
can go without air for some time, Sam. You know that. Besides, it's as
if, as if I should know where we are." With that, he pulled the large
brass lever that opened the doors, and left the dimly lit sanctuary of
the Tardis for the comfortless dark outside.<br>"There's air here," the Doctor called back, then started as he realised Sam was at his side already.<br>"You
don't think I'm going to let you go off out here all by yourself, do
you? Probably end up enjoying yourself poking around. You'd forget all
about me," she said with what she knew the Doctor would realise was
false cheerfulness.<br>"Tread carefully," was his only answer. He lit a
match, but although it burned brightly it lit up nothing of their
surroundings. Puffing it out, he produced a torch from the pocket of
his frock coat instead. "Less gothic," he apologised, "but never mind."<br>The torch beam shone brightly but still they could make out nothing but shadows.<br>"I suppose there's no point going back to the Tardis, is there?" Sam asked tentatively. "We could wait there."<br>"Wait?" queried the Doctor. "For what?"<br>"I don't know. It's like, it feels like something's going to happen here."<br>The Doctor stared at her a little strangely. Suddenly embarrassed, Sam started striding confidently off into the darkness.<br>"Sam!"
called the Doctor suddenly, whipping out a hand and grabbing hold of
her tee shirt. "Don't go marching off like that. You might step in
something. Here, take this."<br>Sam felt smooth fabric being wrapped
around her wrist and realised it was the Doctor's silk cravat, its
silver grey colouring lost in the unrelieved blackness. Since she was
blushing anyway, Sam ventured casually, "Have we just tied the knot?"<br>The Doctor simply said, "This should keep us together."<br>They
moved off warily. It felt to Sam a little like walking on sponge, the
way the dark surface of this place absorbed the noise of their
footsteps.<br>"What's this?" she said, groping the air in front of her and touching something solid and fibrous. "A wall?"<br>"It's some kind of archway," confirmed the Doctor.<br>The
wall was smooth, but she couldn't decide whether it was hard or soft,
warm or cool to the touch. It just was. That seemed to sum up this
place. Somewhere that just was. The Doctor led the way as they moved
cautiously through the narrow tunnel. It twisted round and round,
becoming narrower and narrower, when suddenly the Doctor stopped dead
and she bumped into him with a cry of alarm.<br>"Shush," hissed the Doctor, "there's something up ahead."<br>Sam
turned behind her then, as if a voice had whispered her name. She
caught a glimpse of something moving. A dull pale gold shadow someway
off, just for a moment, then it was gone.<br><br>The
more the babbling creatures caused havoc in the Doctor's head, the more
the confines of this dark citadel were dimly illuminated, the more
concrete and definite the sinister shadow of the giant man clawing at
his head became, towering over him. He closed his eyes once again. Was
this another attempt to make him lose his concentration, to surrender
to whatever force was inside his mind? The Doctor wasn't all that
concerned about the damage the creatures could be doing to his
synapses. He felt strong enough at present to resist their probing, and
was keeping their subtle re-routings of his neural pathways to a
minimum. What really bothered him was the ease with which they were
moving round his mind. He himself found it a baffling, confusing place
to be at times, particularly soon after regeneration. How had these
shadows gained access so effectively? Running round like children, like
children in a nursery. The Doctor remembered talking to Sam back in the
Tardis, soon after they arrived here. <br><br>Sam remembered. The
sharp tug on the cravat wrapped round her wrist bade her follow the
Doctor, and although she opened her mouth to tell him what she had
seen, she suddenly decided against it. What if she had imagined it? The
Doctor needed someone he could rely on in his travels through the
cosmos, not a stupid schoolgirl who jumped at her own shadow. Play it
cool, Sam. Say nothing. It <i>was</i> nothing. She cast a look over
her shoulder despite herself, but there was nothing but the
pitch-blackness. She cursed the Tardis for having to land them here,
then cursed whatever had actually made it do so, then cursed the gold
thing she had glimpsed. This seemed exactly like being in a bad dream.
There seemed no logic to it, no obvious way to respond. Miserably, she
accepted that she was totally out of her depth. So, she reflected a
little sadly, as usual all she could do was trust in the Doctor. But
what if the Doctor was out of his depth too? <br><br>They rounded the
corner of the narrow, twisted passage, and the Doctor stopped abruptly.
They were on a precipice, and for the first time since they'd left the
Tardis, Sam could feel something akin to a breeze. Pinpricks of
painfully bright light sparkled, but it was difficult at first to tell
just how far away they were. Then the lights began to appear more
frequently, like glow worms in a vast underground tunnel. Sam peered
into the gloom. She could discern shapes in the darkness now, like
shadows stretched and twisted into things they were not. Half-formed,
stunted shapes that could have been people littered the giant cavern of
darkness, as if their creators had grown bored sculpting them, and had
abandoned them where they stood. A shiver of fear ran through her at
the sheer scale of it all. <br>"What is it, Doctor?" she whispered, relieved at least to be able to make out the tall figure of her friend beside her.<br><br>The Doctor was transfixed. "Those flashes," he muttered. "I wonder."<br>Some
of the points of light had begun to coalesce, forming faint patches of
luminous mist. In the light they cast, Sam could see the shapes had
distorted, screwed up faces that should never have been seen this way,
the features pinched and pulled. Fear, pain, confusion. Basic
terrifying emotions in their rawest state seemed to have been carved
into these tortured beings. She shook her head, aghast, then she
noticed the cloud of light was getting brighter, stronger. It was also
getting closer.<br>"Back away, Sam." hissed the Doctor.<br>"What?"<br>"Back away!"<br>Together
they turned and stumbled blindly into the tunnel. Casting a look over
her shoulder, Sam could see the patch of light floating towards them. <br>"It's following us."<br>"Quickly," said the Doctor, "down here.<br>Once
Sam had realised that whatever material had formed this place was too
fibrous to cause any real physical harm upon impact, it made it easier
to run like the devil was behind you. The two of them jostled against
each other in the darkness as they pitched forward at high speed into
nothingness. <br>"Do you know where you're going?" panted Sam.<br>"Possibly," replied the Doctor, enigmatically. <br>Everything
was silent as they ran, but after some time, Sam realised their
footfalls were sounding louder, that the fabric beneath their feet was
changing, growing harder, almost like stone. Gradually she could hear
something else. What felt at first like a low pressure in her ears, but
soon became a throbbing, insistent hum. With the noise came a faint
phosphorescence around them. She stopped running.<br>"Doctor?"<br>"Shh, Sam. I know."<br>The
Doctor too had stopped, then with a tug on the cravat to pull Sam
along, he strolled almost casually forward into what seemed like a vast
gloomy amphitheatre. As they stepped inside, the deep sonorous noise
became louder. It sounded in some way familiar. A noise she had grown
used to, distorted and twisted, broken up as if heard through giant
crackling, rattling, loudspeakers. <br>"Well, well," murmured the Doctor solemnly. <br>Sam
could make out weird indentations in the walls, like half-formed
circles. Lumps of the spongy black material that composed this alien
place were tilting up from the uncertain flooring. A huge hexagonal
protruberance grew from the middle of the chamber, and a giant statue
of what might have been a man clutching a bizarre black shape that was
surely his head towered menacingly some twenty feet above them. <br>"Well, Doctor?"<br>"Don't
you see, Sam? Of course. Since I reconfigured the control room." The
Doctor thrust his hands in his pockets and marched slowly around the
murky room. "All this was once alive, pulsing with power. The power to
travel anywhere in time to any point in the universe." He smiled sadly.
"We've spent all this time running round a derelict in space. All
that's left of the ragged hulk of an ancient, dying Tardis."<br>"A
Tardis? Of course." Sam realised what the noise had reminded her of,
although it was a far cry from the clean, comforting hum of the Tardis
she knew. This noise conveyed sickness, pain, as the Doctor had said.
Death. A thought struck her. "So, did it come from your planet?"<br>"Almost definitely."<br>"And
what about him?" Sam gestured to the huge distorted figure, its head in
its hands. "Were there many giants there last time you looked?"<br>The
Doctor ignored Sam's remark and gazed around him. "There's something
more than just decay affecting this place. The whole aspect is changed,
warped around the original way of things. I can just about recognise
the design, enough to know it would have been taken out of service
millennia ago." He stopped abruptly with a sharp intake of breath. When
he spoke again it was in a rushed whisper. "One of the earliest
time-space vessels."<br>"Is that significant?" queried Sam.<br>The
Doctor looked as if he were about to launch into one of his famous
flaps. "What is significant is that we seem to have activated
something. Switched it back on." <br>Along with the pleading low whine
of power in the room, the deformed roundels in the wall pulsed with a
faint light, as if attempting to emulate the emergency lighting of the
Doctor's Tardis.<br>"You think we tripped something?"<br>"I think it
knows I'm a Time Lord, and is responding to my presence." said the
Doctor distantly, still looking around in sad wonder at the malformed
magnificence of the ancient edifice they stood in.<br>Sam swallowed
hard in the gloom and took a deep breath. "I've got to tell you,
Doctor. It's been bothering me. I saw something earlier. I mean, I
think I did."<br>"Saw something?" He was looking at her strangely again. "When?"<br>"Back
in the tunnels before we saw the giant's playroom out there. I know it
sounds stupid, but it was gold coloured, sort of fluid." She realised
the Doctor was looking past her. "Er, hello? You did ask."<br>The
Doctor straightened up and motioned her towards him. As she moved, he
spun her gently around so they were looking the same way. "If you see
it again, could you ask <i>it</i> to ask <i>that</i> to kindly go away and stop bothering us." <br>The
luminous cloud that had pursued them before was suddenly there,
hovering in the warped doorway of what had once been this Tardis's
control room. It was as if the sparks and traces of life within it were
attempting to depict some kind of image. Sam thought she could see the
ghosts of humanoid figures trapped in torment, struggling to get free
of the light that bound them. It hovered near them. <br>"Confuse it?" asked Sam, looking up at the Doctor. He nodded. <br>"We'll
split up," he said. "You go round the back of the console, try to get
its attention. We've got to lure it away from the door." He gave her a
gentle push to get her going, and she sprinted over to the far side of
the huge black outgrowth. <br>"Come
on then, if you think you're hard enough," she bawled at it, her words
echoing around the dismal chamber. Suddenly the light cloud changed its
slow but relentless course. "Doctor!" Sam cried, warningly. "It's after
you."<br>"Run, Sam! Get back to our Tardis quickly."<br>"I can't just
leave you to that." Sam broke off as a glimmer of light down the dark
passage caught her eye. She shivered. For a moment she could see
someone standing like a statue in the faint glow. It was herself, arms
outstretched as if trying to push away something terrible.<br>"Run, Sam!"<br>But
Sam was already moving steadily towards her likeness, through the door
and into the dark corridor beyond, as if drawn on irresistibly in some
way. The image was fading now into a grey mist. She felt fascinated and
horrified at the same time. What the hell was going? Something moved at
Sam's feet, like a trail of dull gold spinning upwards in a spiral. As
she jumped instinctively, she felt a thrill of satisfaction. "Didn't
dream you then, worst luck," she muttered as she found herself twisting
round to follow it, arms raised to defend herself. Abruptly she felt
her body freeze. She knew in an instant she had become the image that
had transfixed her. She was unable even to cry out as the dull gold
poured into her eyes and nose and mouth. The last thing she saw before
the blackness swallowed her was the Doctor, standing stock still in
front of a looming statue of the giant figure as the cloud of light
burst over him. <br><i>We know who you are, Doctor. We know where you come from, where you can take us.</i><br>"I can't take you anywhere. Landing inside your Tardis has fractured my own."<br><i>It is not our Tardis, and we do not need yours.<br></i>"Well,
it really is a terribly long walk to the nearest inhabited stellar
system, and I don't know where you intend to" The Doctor broke off as
he felt something biting into the back of his mind as if it were a nice
fat juicy steak. He shuddered, willing the feeling out of his thoughts.
"What is it you really want?" The Doctor voiced the words out loud
through gritted teeth.<br><i>Freedom regained, Doctor. Freedom to move, to travel, to travel to our memories.<br></i>"If only you'd stop speaking in riddles, perhaps I could help."<br><i>You
will help us, Doctor. You will help us as you die. As you die. As you
go back and back, further and further, younger and younger, and time
takes us where we need to go.<br></i>The Doctor screwed his eyes tight
shut once again. He felt the presence there behind them, bracing itself
for a stronger attack. Then he shut down his cardiovascular system and
retreated inside himself. Held in stasis by the light cloud, his body
barely moved as all signs of life left it.<br>"That won't do you any good."<br>The
Doctor opened his eyes. The voice was familiar. It belonged to the
figure sitting in a comfortable chair by an old mahogany table, pouring
himself a cup of tea.<br>"That's my best china you're using," said the
Doctor, a little tetchily, rubbing his forehead. The figure simply gave
him a cheery smile, but the Doctor found himself frowning. There was
something infuriatingly familiar about this man in his dark green
velvet frock coat, grey trousers and white wing collar shirt.<br>"You're me! What are you doing serving me tea inside my head?"<br>"Well,
it is my head too, after all. I'm not exactly trespassing. Nice try,
shutting down your body to consolidate your strength of mind. But it
didn't confuse them for long."<br>"Didn't? What do you mean, didn't?"<br>"I know your head is under siege right now, but do try to use what bits you've got left, hmm?"<br>"You're from my, our, future?"<br>"Precisely.
And no, I'm not a trick or an illusion. This ancient Tardis's
telepathic circuits have corroded to the point of dissolution. I was
able to use vestigial spillage from them to send an aspect of myself
back to myself. Well, to you."<br>"Very clever. Exactly what I'd have done myself if I was on the verge of death and had to get a warning across."<br>"It's our last chance."<br>"What about Sam?"<br>"Oh,
these idiots will release her soon, unharmed. Humans can't aid them in
their plan so they think it the most wonderful fun to let her watch me
die before. Yes, well, never mind all that. They end up getting so
chatty they practically bore us to death. They're insane, but massively
powerful and well-adapted. We've got no more resistance left in us just
a few hours from now. This was as far back as I could reach me. You, I
mean. I know it goes against the laws of Time, but if we don't do
something soon, there may be no laws of Time left to break. Biscuit?"<br>"What are these creatures?"<br>"The
Forgotten. That's the name they've given themselves. It's no wonder
they've been forgotten. Just one more shameful secret in the Dark
Scrolls of Gallifrey's history. Memory surfers using the cerebral
cortex's of Time Lords for high tide."<br>"What!"<br>"Yes, it's
starting to come back now, isn't it? Way, way back, when the amplified
panatropic neuron network of Gallifrey was created. When the minds of
our dead were converted into so many neural complexes arranged in a
matrix pattern to form the repository of all Time Lord knowledge."<br>"Would
you mind sparing me the lecture? Talking to yourself is a terrible
habit and I imagine we're running out of time to break it."<br>"A group
of Time Lords working on the neuro-mechanics of the Matrix learned all
sorts of secrets in the course of their work. They reasoned that
through exploiting an individual's reserves of Artron energy, it should
be theoretically possible to travel through a Time Lord's actual
physical past."<br>"What?"<br>"Oh, yes. Each micro-second of
experienced life is stored in our minds. Makes sense. It explains why
the APC network is so terribly efficient at pondering the Time Lord's
imponderables."<br>"Why it's the ultimate contemplator of Gallifreyan navels, you mean. Go on."<br>"I'm
sure you can imagine the rest. In their arrogance, their boredom, their
irresponsible quest for thrills, this bunch of Forgotten nit-wits
underwent a temporary conversion into aggressive electrochemical
impulses, and got into some poor soul's head. Back, back, through the
hundreds of years he'd lived, and then upstream back to their present.
And on their little jaunt they learnt another secret."<br>"Well?"<br>"The means with which to interact with the victim's own history. Gaining physical access to his past."<br>"Time travel through an individual's time line."<br>"Through
a Time Lord's time line. Some caprice of the genetic imprimatur that
enables any of us to travel through time. And by stopping off at any
point in the victim's past when they're in close with another, older
host, by bridging the synaptic gap"<br>"They can move ever further back through time. But why?"<br>"Why
not? It was a game to them. A diversion. And a proving of their own
genius. Imagine if their experiments had proved successful? Biological
Tardises grown from Time Lord cells. But there was a side effect they
couldn't have foretold."<br><i>Kill you. Kill you.</i><br>"There isn't much time. Quickly."<br>"They
perfected&nbsp;the move from carrier to carrier, but, on exiting the
body the life of the initial host simply unwound. At the point of
entry, the meddler's effect had unpicked a stitch in the physical
pattern of their host, left a thread dangling. When they left the body
they tugged&nbsp;on that thread and the host's entire life unravelled.
Imagine it. An innocent life being made to die a trillion times over
through every point in its history. The records of Time being rewritten
with each passing second as that person's life was truncated, cut off
at the point where the electrochemical surfers left the host body."<br>"And started again on someone new."<br>"Yes.
They were trapped in a subjective past, moving from host to host,
killing indiscriminately. I'm not surprised old Rassilon abandoned them
to their fate. They ended up inside the poor old owner of this ship. He
must have had some kind of seizure while on reconnaissance, charting
this sector of space for the time-space maps way, way back."<br>"Brain-damaged, comatose."<br>"They
went mad with him. Well, lovely meeting me, but I really think you'd
better stop them now, don't you? They'll travel back down our time
stream to a point before we left Gallifrey to run amok there. Who knows
what damage they'll do. They're desperate to be free, to be remembered,
celebrated as pioneers."<br>"Pioneers? Dah. Reckless bunglers and murderers. Deranged killers!"<br>Even as he yelled out the words, the Doctor clutched at his temples and the blackness closed in around him.<br><i>Kill you.</i><br><br>He
came to in the gloom of the ancient cartographer's Tardis, his mind
reeling as he felt the mental dams he'd erected beginning to crumble
under the onslaught of the Forgotten. An image of the Flower of
Remembrance blazed in his head so brightly it threatened to eclipse all
coherent thought,<br>"Doctor, you're all right." <br>The voice echoed
through his confused thoughts. He focused on it, used it to consolidate
his senses in the midst of the assault. It was Sam's voice.<br>"Hello, Sam," he mumbled. "I'm glad you're all right."<br>Sam looked at him with a worried frown.<br>"Just about. Are you all right?"<br>The Time Lord leapt to his feet. <br>"On
the contrary. I'm going to be used as a bridgehead to wreak havoc
across all Gallifrey before ceasing to exist, rewriting about a million
histories and wiping out a mighty chunk of the entire causal nexus that
holds the universe together." He shuddered, then gazed at his bemused
companion. "You know, when you've been about as much as I have, I
really hate to imagine what the universe would have been like without
me."<br>"What are you talking about, Doctor?" asked Sam, fear and worry lining her face. "What's"<br>The Doctor's cry of pain cut her off.<br>"Have to do something. It's now or never. They're through. They're moving back through my time line."<br>Sibilant
whispering laughter echoed around the void as the Forgotten exalted at
the continuation of their journey. Subatomic particles flashed and
jostled and decayed about them as the impulses travelled faster than
inspiration through the encoded DNA patterns of the Doctor's physical
history. <br>"Psychic surgery," whispered a voice in his head. It was his own voice. "Come on, you can do it. I'll help."<br>Flashes
of memories came to him, a rough chart of the impulse's progress.
They'd easily broached the last time he'd regenerated, pushing past
bleary operating tables and bullets in San Francisco, through Cheetah
People, Daleks, Nimons, Kraals. The Doctor was bewildered at the speed
with which they were moving back, so fast he could barely register what
was happening. And still they were moving through his lives, to Ogrons
and Draconians, Drashigs and Axons, ever further back. <br>He tried to focus himself, to concentrate. The regeneration was imminent.<br>"Now!"
came his own voice from far away, but it was already too late. He
shuddered as the grey-haired, dandified figure was born from the pain
and dismay of the little dark-haired clown, tried and convicted by the
very people he was fighting now to save. Back through the past of his
second incarnation, through Krotons and Ice Warriors, Yeti and Macra.
Yes, he'd feel them more acutely now.<br>"Feed them through. That's right. Back, back, come on! Come on!"<br>"Come
on, Doctor", urged Sam. The Doctor knew what was coming. He remembered.
It had happened in the Tardis as he'd left Antarctica after his first
meeting with the Cybermen, his body changing from that of an old man,
rejuvenating itself, jewellery slipping from his new fingers, a part of
him dying off so another could be born. It was there he had to act. <br>"Step
inside," he whispered quietly as the rushing babbling and laughter
reached a crescendo. He held his head as if impersonating the huge
figure above them, and for a moment he winced as he felt something
leave him. A ghost of a possible future that had given him the help
he'd needed to cheat it. He shook his head. It never paid to analyse
paradoxes too closely. <br>"Come on!" he yelled, then realised Sam was already at the doorway of the blackened control room.<br>"You
come on," said Sam, challenging him, but there was no disguising the
tears of relief in her eyes. In a moment he was by her side, then
pulling her along behind him, explaining what had been happening to him
as he went. He suddenly seemed to know where he was going despite the
darkness.<br>"You were held by the defence mechanisms of this old
crate," he continued, although by this time Sam was finding it
difficult to boggle and run effectively at the same time. "A kind of
temporal stasis field. We Time Lords were a far more paranoid race back
then. Wouldn't get any nasty tricks like that on the Tardises I grew up
with. <br>"This place is really that old?" marvelled Sam, breathlessly.<br>"Really.
The Forgotten externalised their madness on to the rest of the ship
through the telepathic circuits, stained it black like this. But now
they've made the jump to me, this whole time stream will be coming
unstable. The owner died millions of years ago, and this Tardis never
came here." He paused, suddenly reflective and sombre. "I'm glad that
all these eons of insanity and darkness will be wiped clean."<br>Something
seemed to be happening. It was getting lighter, and the dull humming of
the decaying ship was starting to rise in pitch. At last they reached
the reassuring blue Police Box exterior of the Doctor's Tardis.<br>"And these Forgotten things?" asked Sam, her mind racing to catch up. "They're still in your head now?"<br>"Trapped
in a sealed segment of my brain. A tiny part of my mind that dies when
I regenerate. It's like shedding a skin, or, for the Forgotten, it's
like being caught inside a cut that's healed over."<br>"Can you contain them in there? I mean, for ever?"<br>"I
hope so," said the Doctor, pausing in the Tardis's doorway. "I only
hope they'll be able to keep themselves entertained." He grinned. "I'm
planning to be around for quite a little while yet, you know."<br><br>The shades of darkness outside were blurring, shifting. "This reality is dissolving. Come on, Sam, It's time we were gone."<br>"So the Tardis will be freed, yeah?" said Sam as she was ushered inside. "I mean, it'll never have been here."<br>"Precisely," said the Doctor with a grin.<br>"So will we remember any of it then?"<br>The Doctor's eyes were haunted as the Tardis began to vibrate in sympathy with its surroundings. <br>"Perhaps
somethings are best forgotten," was his only answer. And at that
self-same instant, the dark carbuncle in space was no more, leaving the
Doctor and Sam free to continue their journey.<br>
