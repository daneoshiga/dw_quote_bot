[OC]: It was on the planet Skaro that my old enemy the Master was
finally put on trial. They say he listened calmly as his list of evil
was read and sentence passed. Then he made his last, and I thought
somewhat curious, request. He demanded that I, the Doctor, a rival Time
Lord, should take his remains back to our home planet, Gallifrey. </font>

urn.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: The Time Lord has thirteen lives and the Master had used
all of his, but rules never meant much to him. So I stowed his remains
safely away for the voyage back, because even in death I couldn't trust
him. <br>
(The urn is placed in an ornate casket, then the Doctor takes his sonic
screwdriver from a Gladstone bag and seals it shut.) <br>
DOCTOR 7: There, that should do it. <br>
(The Tardis has been remodelled into a more cosy yet open plan area.
The Doctor puts a cup of tea on a pile of books next to his easy chair
and listens to a jazz record playing on his gramophone.) <br>
DOCTOR [OC]: In all my travels through space and time, and nearing the
end of my seventh life, I was finally beginning to realise that you
could never be too careful. <br>
SINGER: It was a beautiful sight. Your kiss was a flame, not the spot
that somehow dies. <br>
(The time console screen reads Destination – Gallifrey, Local Dateline
5725.2 Rassilon Era.) <br>

and eats it.) <br>
SINGER: Each time I wake, knowing you're not here. <br>
(The Doctor continues to read his young friend Herbert's latest novel,
The Time Machine.) <br>
SINGER: But what can I do? <br>
(The casket cracks open.) <br>
SINGER: Time, time, time. <br>
(The needle gets stuck in the record groove. The Doctor gets up to move
it along then settles back in his chair. After a little while, he
notices strange eddies in his cup of tea. The record gets stuck again,
the cup of tea flies up and spills itself and the casket breaks in two.
Gunk pours out and something slithers over to the wooden console. There
is a short-circuit. The Doctor rushes over and starts operating
controls. He throws on the brake and the time rotor stops, then he
pulls down a monitor.) <br>
DOCTOR 7: Oh, no. <br>
(Critical Timing Malfunction. Instigate Automatic Emergency Landing. <br>
The Doctor walks down the candle-lined passage to the chest of drawers
where the casket had been placed, and sees the damage.)

A Chinese woman looks out of her window to the busy street where three
youths narrowly avoid being run down by a car. They duck down an
alleyway but are chased by a black car. The youths climb over a gate,
and shoot at the car driver when he stops and gets out. He gets back in
and reverses away.) <br>
LEE: Hey! Where you going, man? Come back here. Wimp! <br>
(The jubilant trio start off down the alley when a metal pipe falls to
the ground behind them. Four Chinese gangsters appear from behind some
packing cases, produce automatic weapons and mow the youths down. Only
Lee manages to get to cover, but that is soon blasted away. He stands
exposed in front of a billboard.) <br>
GANGSTER: Say your prayers, Lee! <br>

the Tardis materialises in front of Lee. The gangsters empty their ammo
clips at it. The door opens and the Doctor comes out. They shoot him,
then the car drives up and they get inside.) <br>
GANGSTER: What was that thing? <br>

behind the Tardis. He checks on his dead friends, then the wounded

knocking him out, and finishes unshackling himself. He runs down to
where Grace is lying by the Eye.) <br>
DOCTOR: Grace. <br>
(The Master roars and swings at the Doctor's head with a reflector
staff. The Doctor rolls away just in time.) <br>
MASTER: You are my life. <br>
(The Master kicks the Doctor in the stomach twice then tries to throw
him into the Eye.) <br>
DOCTOR: You want dominion over the living, yet all you do is kill! <br>
MASTER: Life is wasted on the living! <br>
(Thank you, Douglas Adams. The Doctor manages to push the Master off
again. When he lunges again, the Doctor turns one of the reflector
staffs to shine on him. The Master is caught in a powerful wind and
grabs onto a staff. He hangs there trying not to fall into the eye.) <br>
DOCTOR: Give me your hand! <br>
MASTER: Never! <br>
(The Master looses his grip on the staff and is sucked slowly and
painfully into the Eye.) <br>
MASTER: Doctor! <br>
(He is gone, and everything goes quiet. With the clocks stuck on
midnight, San Francisco time, the Doctor carries Grace up the stairs
and lays her next to Lee. The clocks start to move backwards. December
30th. The Eye throws out a bundle of golden energy which settles on Lee
and Grace. They breathe again and open their eyes.) <br>
LEE: Doctor, I have your things. <br>
DOCTOR: Hello, Grace. Well, how does it feel to hold back death? <br>
(The Eye closes. <br>
DOCTOR: Incredible! Did you see that? What a sentimental old thing this
Tardis is. Well, congratulations. You've both been somewhere I've never
been. <br>
GRACE: It's nothing to be scared of, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: Glad to hear it. <br>
GRACE: Did we go back far enough? <br>
DOCTOR: Either that or I'm talking to a couple of ghosts, and I don't
believe in ghosts. </font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The Tardis is in flight.) <br>
LEE: So, where's the Master? <br>
(The Tardis grumbles.) <br>
DOCTOR: Indigestion. So, let's see where we are. There. The future. <br>
LEE: Wow. <br>
DOCTOR: Look over there, on the other side of your galaxy. That's home.
<br>
GRACE: Gallifrey. <br>
DOCTOR: Two hundred and fifty million light years away. That's a good
ten minutes in this old thing. <br>
GRACE: So, where are we? <br>
DOCTOR: December twenty ninth. Do you want to get off here? <br>
GRACE: I don't think I could live through that again, <br>
LEE: I definitely wouldn't live through that again. <br>
DOCTOR: Reason enough. <br>
(The Doctor moves the destination calendar to December 31st and adjusts
a pair of rheostats. The time rotor stops. After a moment, the Doctor
hits the console and it starts up again.)

Auld Lang Syne.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(The Tardis materialises by an ornamental lake. The
celebrations and fireworks are in full swing.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now that's as it should be. <br>
LEE: Your things. <br>
DOCTOR: Oh! My sonic screwdriver. Thank you. <br>
LEE: And these, too. <br>
(He holds up the bags of gold dust.) <br>
DOCTOR: Please, keep them. <br>
LEE: Really? <br>
DOCTOR: Yes, really. <br>
LEE: I'd better go before you change your mind. <br>
DOCTOR: Lee! Next Christmas, take a vacation. Just don't be here. <br>
LEE: Right! Thanks. Thanks, Doctor! See you around, Grace. Happy new
year! <br>
(Lee runs off.) <br>
GRACE: There you go, interfering again. <br>
DOCTOR: Grace, something you should know <br>
GRACE: Don't tell me. <br>
DOCTOR: Why not? <br>
GRACE: I know who I am, and that's enough. <br>
DOCTOR: I'm glad. Come with me. <br>
GRACE: You come with me. <br>
DOCTOR: Me come with you? <br>
GRACE: Yes. <br>
DOCTOR: Me come with you? It's tempting. <br>
GRACE: I'm going to miss you. <br>
DOCTOR: How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two
hearts, remember. <br>
GRACE: That's not what I meant. <br>
(They kiss and fireworks explode.) <br>
GRACE: Thank you, Doctor. <br>
DOCTOR: No, no. Thank you, Doctor. <br>
(The Doctor returns to the Tardis, turns to take one last look, and
goes inside. The Tardis dematerialises.) </font></p>

armchair.) <br>
DOCTOR: Now, where was I? <br>
(He picks up his book, and the needle gets stuck in the record.) <br>
DOCTOR: Oh no, not again. </font> </p>
