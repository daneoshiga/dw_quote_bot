Who. Earth and Beyond. <br>Bounty, by Peter Anghelides.<br>
<br>
"Dear Mum and Dad," the Doctor read aloud. "Kidnapped by
time-travelling alien, scenery wonderful, back yesterday. Love Sam."<br>
He laughed lightly and handed back the postcard. "You should try the postal service on my planet."<br>
"Oh,
sure," said Sam, sitting up on the warm white sand. "We haven't even
left this planet yet. Next time perhaps you'll manage to fly us
somewhere out of this world. Venus, maybe, or California."<br>
"Oh, no," said the Doctor. "The deal was for just one trip. Next time
it's straight back to London."<br>
"Doctor,"
she wheedled in the same tone she used when her mum wanted her to the
dishwasher. "I don't want to go back home. Come on, one more trip round
the block. We could go to Mars, or don't you have enough unleaded?"<br>
The
Doctor harumphed and turned away. "I suppose I know how you feel", he
muttered. "I ran away from home once. But I still had to go home to my
own people eventually."<br>
Sam stared across at the Doctor. He was
silhouetted against the sparkling water of the Indian Ocean, his wild
brown curls flicking about his head in the light distant breezes. He'd
told her that his appearance had changed recently. She wondered what
he'd looked like with shorter hair. <br>
"If he really travelled the universe", she began, "we should play 'I
Never Did.'" She could see he was looking blank. "Me
and Melissa play it at school. You tell me something you've never ever
done, and if I've already done it, you score a point. If I haven't done
it either, I score a point."<br>
"Hmm," said the Doctor, sounding interested. <br>
"Winner gets to choose where we go next." she added quickly.<br>
"Hmm,"
he said, less convinced. He looked straight at her and she shivered.
His amused expression suggested he was teasing her. Behind his sea
green eyes she sensed something deeper, something much older.<br>
"I'll
start," said Sam, briskly. She held up both hands, palms towards her,
fingers outstretched. "Before today, I'd never been to the Seychelles."<br>
The
Doctor's grin widened. "Neither had I. That's a point to me, isn't it?"
He laughed at her scowl. He held up his hands too, folding one long
forefinger towards his palm. " My turn. I've never been a member of
Greenpeace."<br>
Sam scowled some more. "Not fair. They won't have application forms on
your planet. Okay, er, I've never been to Pluto."<br>
"Lucky guess?" asked the Doctor. "I have." He was studying her
reaction. <br>
"Two one." she said, and realised she'd have great difficulty working
out what he <i>had</i> done, where he <i>had</i>
been. "Yeah, nice one, Samantha." she told herself.<br>
"My turn." said the Doctor. His expression changed. "I've never kissed
Danny Watson."<br>
Sam
dropped her hands into her lap and gazed at him. "But how could you"
The Doctor blinked innocently and folded back another finger. "Three
one? Your turn."<br>
Sam stared off into the middle distance. A man with
a metal detector was scanning between the two palms which stretched
almost horizontal across the beach. He was sweeping methodically across
the sand, stooping occasionally to examine a find, discarding it after
a brief examination. Sam suddenly said to the Doctor, "I've never
killed anyone." There was a long pause. The Doctor stared into the blue
sky, utterly still. The light breeze ruffled his hair again, moved the
wing collar of his open shirt slightly. Maybe that's what made Sam
shiver. She watched him for a while. He had nice cheek bones and his
lips were pursed appeallingly. He was a handsome man. Could he really be an
alien? Could he kill someone?<br>
"That cloud," he said, pointing. "It looks like a Chukian Ice Ape."<br>
Sam
was about to remonstrate with him for avoiding the question when she
felt a sharp pain. She gave a little cry. At once the Doctor turned to
her. "What is it?" Sam was examining a small dark object that she'd
leaned on in the sand. It was about the size of a pocket calculator,
but she couldn't decide whether it was plastic or metal. It was
surrounded by short dangling wires and seemed to be scorched all across
one side. The Doctor took it from her quickly and stared at the object
so closely that his nose almost touched it. <br>
"It isn't from this planet."<br>
"Yeah, right," said Sam. "You can tell just like that?<br>
"Of
course," he said, as though challenging her to doubt him. "You'd
recognise plastic if you found it in sixteenth century France, wouldn't
you?" The Doctor rummaged in the pocket of his waistcoat, which lay on
the sand beside him. "For example, what do you suppose this is?"<br>
Sam
looked at the thing he was holding up. It looked like a little metal
spade on a piece of grubby old string. "Isn't that the key to your
Tundish?"<br>
"The key to my Tardis," he said wearily, and wiggled the piece of
string. "But what's it made of?"<br>
"Well,
metal, of course." said Sam. "She took the key and hefted it in her
palm, surprised to find it tingled. "Not metal," she said. "Urgh, it
feels like it's alive. Okay, it's alien."<br>
The Doctor didn't reply.
He had moved down the beach to a pool of seawater which filled a
scooped patch of black rock near the shoreline. He wiped the
sand-covered artefact with a dampened handkerchief.<br>
"So what is that, then?" asked Sam. <br>
The Doctor clicked his tongue irritably. "I don't recognise all alien
artefacts instantaneously, you know."<br>
"My
hero has feet of clay," said Sam. She looked down at the Doctor's bare
feet and studied his long, pale toes in the sand for a moment. As she
did, she spotted another small alien object, like a TV remote control.
She stooped to pick it up. The blow that came next wasn't particularly
hard, but it took Sam off guard and she sprawled in the sand. She
rolled over. It was the man with the metal detector who must have run
silently across the beach while they were talking. Sam spat out grains
of sand and wiped her mouth with the back of one hand. "Oi!" she cried,
as she struggled back up. "What's your game?" She could feel the Doctor
holding her firmly by the upper arms. <br>
"Sam, Sam," he was saying quietly. "Perhaps you shouldn't annoy him."<br>
"Or
what?" she snapped, shrugging him off. "He'll punk me with his metal
detector?" She glared furiously at the newcomer, trying to stare him
down, wanting him to blink first. When he did, Sam took an involuntary
step backwards into the Doctor. The man's eyelids had blinked sideways.
Sam looked more closely, The man seemed to be wearing the comfortable
faded colours of the handful of tourists they'd seen earlier, but Sam
couldn't focus properly on his battered sun hat, his pale blue and
white striped tee shirt, his patchwork trousers. It was a freaky
feeling, like staring at a magic eye puzzle and not deciphering the
hidden image. One thing did seem clear, though. He wasn't holding a
metal detector. <br>
"That's a gun." she said. "It's an alien gun."<br>
"Very good," murmured the Doctor. "You're really getting the hang of
this."<br>
"Stay
where you are," said the metal detector man. Sam couldn't place the
accent. North London, maybe? It was too bizarre. She didn't have time
to speculate further. Metal detector man lunged forward, snatching at
the artefact she'd plucked from the sand. Sam felt herself pushed aside
and knew the Doctor must have shoved her away as he lashed out at the
gunman with his bare foot. Sam watched the alien's weapon spin lazily
in the warm air before it dropped into the nearby rock pool with a
sploop sound. Metal detector man half moved after it, but changed his
mind. With a snarl of rage he threw himself at the Doctor, who fell
backwards into the soft sand. Sam moved to help him, but metal detector
man was already running away across the sand, towards the line of palms
at the top of the beach. <br>
The Doctor stood, and brushed sand from his serge trousers. "You know,"
he said, "there was something odd about him."<br>
Sam snorted. "What, apart from the fact that he was shoving an alien
gun up our nostrils?"<br>
"Perhaps he just wanted to get his property back," said the Doctor.<br>
"Well, he snatched your Tardis key while he was at it." said Sam. "I
hope you had a spare."<br>
The
Doctor's jaw dropped. "That was the spare." He glared around him.
"Shoes," he muttered. "Shoes, shoes, shoes. Ah ha! " He spotted his
scuffed grey slip-ons, snatched them up and started off over the sand. <br>
"Wait for me," said Sam, moving after him. <br>
The
Doctor turned around and brought her to a halt. For a moment she
thought he was agreeing, then he pulled one of her hands from her side
and pressed something into it. "Stay here. Watch this. Back soon.. And
at this, he hurried off after the disappearing alien. Sam stared at the
damp object in her hand. It was the first of the alien artefacts that
she had found.<br>
<br>
The
Doctor found the bicycles where he and Sam had abandoned them at the
top of the beach. He was soon skittering along the dirt track road
after metal detector man. The road curved upwards, growing steadily
steeper. Ahead, the Doctor could see a thin man jogging up hill,
braided ropes of hair jostling over his dark shoulders. At first he
thought it was a Seychellois main until the figure turned his head. <br>
"Splay nosed," said the Doctor to himself as he pedalled on. "And
brachycephalic. What should that remind me of?"<br>
Around
the next bend he came upon a group of islanders carrying boxes of ripe
fruit down the steep hill. They seemed unmoved by the sight of a
strange alien. The Doctor looked at the creature again and was
surprised to see it shimmering, like a heat haze on the hot road
surface. Now it did look like a Seychellois. And instead of alien
equipment in its hand, it was carrying a simple fishing rod. <br>
"Of course!" said the Doctor. "I should have guessed. It's a Rhiptogan."<br>
The
islanders came past him, nudging each other and laughing at the strange
wild-haired figure on a bicycle. The Rhiptogan had paused briefly,
looking back at the sound of laughter.<br>
"Wait!" called the Doctor. "I only want my key back." <br>
But
the Rhiptogan had already started to run. The Doctor stood up on the
bike pedals and gave chase. The road flattened as they reached the
village clearing between the tall palms. A small group of Seychellois
were stepping out into the long cool shadow thrown across the street by
a church's tall white bell tower. The Rhiptogan shimmered and slipped
into the growing crowd. <br>
"You can't hide," the Doctor shouted, skidding his bicycle to a halt.
"You can't fool me as easily as you can humans."<br>
There
was a blur of movement beyond the congregation at the corner of the
church. He hopped off his bike and wheeled it swiftly between the
islanders. Several nuns in white habits were emerging from an arched
door in the side of the church. Three of them were whispering to each
other. Two more smiled at him as they sat down on a sunny bench. To
their right was a battered Seychelles Mini Moke, its black fabric roof
half rolled back and its rear seats full of decorating equipment. At
the wheel of this vehicle was another nun, staring straight ahead
through the grimy windshield. She was panting. The Doctor grinned and
stepped forward, at which point the nun gave him a furious look, gunned
the engine and accelerated toward him, her wimple flapping in the rush
of air. The Doctor threw himself to one side and the Rhiptogan swerved
past him onto the winding road. He leapt to his feet, scattering nuns
like frightened geese, and scrabbling his way back towards the bicycle.
It lay in a tangled mess by the roadside, its wheels buckled and
useless where the Mini Moke had driven over them. The Mini Moke
disappeared down the steep road in a cloud of red dust. Through its
open metal frame, he could see the Rhiptogan driver's rope-like hair
flapping in the slipstream. The Doctor stood at the roadside, arms
akimbo, and stared helplessly into the blue sky. Behind him the church
congregation buzzed with amazement. But he could also hear the drone of
an engine returning. He peered through the dense foliage beyond the
road, and saw the grimy yellow shape of the Mini Moke swerving through.
The Doctor remembered how he and Sam had pushed their bicycles up to
the village earlier that day. The hillside was so steep that the road
had to wind up in in long, almost parallel, stretches, so if he cut
through the foliage in a more or less straight line, his path would
intersect with the road at three or four points. Maybe he could reach
the Mini Moke and recover his key before the Rhiptogan reached the
Tardis further down the hill. <br>
<br>
He dived into the undergrowth,
feeling thorny plants snatch at his legs. Tall grass and low tree
branches whipped across his line of vision, and he half ran, half slide
down the sharp incline. The sandy road surface suddenly appeared ahead,
and he sprang out onto the dirt track, skidded straight across it and
plunged back into the trees. The engine noise faded. Through a
clearing, the Doctor could see grey tarmac where the road joined the
island's main thoroughfare. Briefly blinded by the sun, he pushed
through a large spider's web that stretched between two tree trunks.
It's sticky strands clung to his cheek. The spider dropped onto his
right shoulder. It's body was the size of his hand, and it's legs clung
tentatively across his neck. He twisted into the roadway, flicking at
the creature with his left hand. It dropped off him and scuttled out of
view. The Doctor fell heavily onto the tarmac just as the Mini Moke
screamed past. The oily smell of exhaust filled his nostrils, his white
shirt sleeves were spotted with blood from his plunge through the razor
sharp leaves. He spun round to watch the Mini Moke approaching the next
turn, two hundred metres from where he was lying in the road. Ahead was
the Tardis, half covered by a drooping Takamaka tree. The Rhiptogan was
slowing down as it approached. The Doctor staggered to his feet,
desperate to prevent the alien from getting there first, but the Mini
Moke accelerated, swerved into the bend and roared past. The
Doctor stumbled over to the Tardis and leaned heavily on its warm blue
surface. The Rhiptogan had not tried to enter it, perhaps unaware of
its purpose. But the Doctor still had to recover the key or he would
never get back in. And then, returning Sam to London would be the least
of his problems. <br>
<br>
Sam
examined the alien artefact. She's moved into the shade of two
storm-damaged palm trees, because it was early afternoon and blondes
burn badly. The artefact had started bleeping shortly after this, and
the further she'd shuffled up the beach, the more the bleeping
intensified. After some experimentation, her Babylon Five training told
her it must be a tracer, so she carried on past the line of spindly
palms until she found a furrow of torn foliage with fresh growth all
through it. Some two hundred metres in she found the entrance to a dark
cave, surrounded by odd pale leaves. Much of the flora in the Seychelles
seemed strange to her. She stepped through it carefully. When her bare
legs brushed against the nodding flowerheads, she felt a slight
stinging sensation, so she covered her legs, put on her deck shoes, and
continued warily into the cave. She paused to let her eyes adjust.
Ahead of her was a metal door, part buried in sand and foliage. She was
reaching for what looked like the handle when she heard a rustling
sound from behind her. As she turned, she saw the alien. It was there
only for a second, blinking at her with reptilian in its flat grey
saucer face, thick black ropes of hair hanging down the sides of its
head. When she blinked in disbelief, she saw instead a bare-chested
Seychellois man, like someone she'd seen painting on the beach earlier.
<br>
"Excuse," he said in a soft voice. "Car(?) tu parler?" Then he blinked
at her, and she saw behind his eyes. She fell back against the door,
feeling her legs stinging again. <br>
"Sorry," she said, cautiously. "Didn't mean to trespass."<br>
"Oh,
you speak English," said the islander in the same quiet tone. Sam
straightened a little. "You too, mate. And that's harder to believe.
You've gone and blown your cover, haven't you."<br>
The creature's
outline shimmered like an image in water. The flat-faced alien was
suddenly standing in his place again. "I didn't want to alarm you," he
said, his voice curiously unchanged. "I won't hurt you. I mean, do I
look like an assassin?"<br>
Sam surprised herself by laughing. "How would I know?" She dusted her
hand on her tee-shirt then held it out. "My name's Sam."<br>
The alien considered her out-stretched arm warily. "I am Ladeeth. I mean
you no harm."<br>
"I bet you say that to all the girls," said Sam.<br>
<br>
The
Doctor slumped into the seat, offering the plump Seychelles woman his
apologies when he dropped small pieces of earth and torn leaves into
her washing basket. She said nothing, merely adjusting a large white
sun hat and staring past him through the window. The single decker bus
wound cautiously down the hill. After a short while, the Doctor spotted
the Mini Moke by the roadside. He jumped up, startling the passengers
nearby. "Arrête ici, s'il vous plaît," he called to the driver. He
waved his fingers at the plump woman in apology. "Bonne après-midi," he
said, and skidded down to the exit doors as the bus juddered to a halt.
<br>
<br>
The Mini Moke was parked carelessly outside a simple Seychelles
dwelling. The building was all weathered white-painted planks, and the
open windows overlooked a beach of stark black rocks. One of the
rusting corrugated sheets on its roof had a jagged hole at the side.
The Doctor climbed slowly up the worn stone steps at the front. He
crept over the veranda and cautiously stepped into the single main
room. The Rhiptogan had its back to him, and was crouched over a metre
wide cube of dull metal. The alien was in its natural form, the
leathery grey skin and heavy knotted hair plainly visible. Bright
afternoon sunlight flooded into the room through a gaping hole in the
ceiling where the cube must have smashed through the roof. The cube was
stuck at an angle in the splintered wooden floor boards, and it was
filled with flickering technology. The Doctor felt a rush of relief
when he saw a simple wooden table holding a small pile of alien
equipment. He stepped quietly to the table to recover the Tardis key,
but as he reached out he nudged a cylindrical object which rolled
slowly across the table towards the Rhiptogan. The Doctor clutched at
it but succeeded only in scattering the other objects over the table.
Several tumbled over the edge and onto the floor boards with a tinkling
crash. The Rhiptogan spun round at once, its shape blurring through
several possible disguises. It veered towards the Doctor, who staggered
back against the crazed plasterwork of the nearest wall. <br>
"Ah, hello," he stuttered. "I er, merely wanted to recover my key. I'm
sorry if I alarmed you."<br>
The alien stared wildly, its eyes flashing with mixed fear and anger.
"You are Ruduses creature. You want to kill me."<br>
"No," insisted the Doctor. "My friend found some of your property from
the beach."<br>
The Rhiptogan was brandishing some kind of repair tool with a very
sharp end to it. "Keep away from the navicom."<br>
"I'm sorry if I alarmed you," said the Doctor. "Perhaps I can help you
complete your repairs?"<br>
The
Rhiptogan stepped closer, and the Doctor winced as it trod on a fallen
component with a crunching sound. "Oh dear. Sorry about that, too." <br>
Abruptly,
the Rhiptogan backed away, staring past the Doctor. The Doctor turned
to see a broad figure in a large white sun hat standing in the doorway.
It was the woman from the bus, her basket of washing tucked under one
plump arm. <br>
"Don't be alarmed, madam," said the Doctor, moving to
her side. But the woman flicked out her free hand at him, and this
small gesture was enough to slam him into the far wall. He sank down,
dazed, flakes of plaster falling onto his shoulders.<br>
"Ruduse," said the Rhiptogan to the woman, plainly terrified. "I knew
it."<br>The
woman's form shimmered and reformed in the grey-blue shape of a female
Rhiptogan. "That's right, Lirpa. You've nowhere to hide." Her basket of
washing transformed into a heavy sharp-edged machete. "Now, tell me
where to find your accomplice." She scanned the room. "Where is
Ladeeth?" <br>Lirpa had backed away from Ruduse, trying to hide the metal box. "I won't let you harm him." <br>Ruduse&nbsp;slapped the repair tool out of his grasp. "Bad choice. Perhaps I'll kill you."<br>Lirpa shrank back. "That thought had crossed my mind."<br>"It didn't have a long journey, then." snapped Ruduse. <br>"Your mind is filled with thoughts of death." whimpered Lirpa. <br>Ruduse&nbsp;shook
her long braids of black hair, and the Doctor realised she was
laughing. "And money. There's a handsome price on Ladeeth's ugly head,
dead or alive. You're just small change, Lirpa. Help me, and I'll
forget about you." Ruduse angled the knife close to his face. She
nodded at the metal cube beside them. "I'll even leave you this pitiful
collection of junk. I see you've recovered the navicom, but not the
tracer."<br>The Doctor groaned and got to his feet. "Actually, I may be
able to help. I think my friend found your tracer. So if you'll just
put down the unpleasant knife."<br>"Shut up!" barked Ruduse suddenly, swivelling her arm to point the blade at the Doctor. <br>Lirpa
lunged forward at Ruduse, who struggled to pull the knife round. They
collided with the navicom cube, which toppled over noisily. Sparks
fizzed and spluttered from it. Lirpa seized Ruduse and was able to
throw her to one side, kicking the knife towards the Doctor. He picked
it up as though it were alive and threw it in one looping arc out of
the open window. Across the room from him, the two Rhiptogans were
fighting savagely. Beside them the navicom cube started to burn with a
fierce orange flame. The Doctor crawled across the floor to pick up a
rusty red bucket full of sand, a primitive fire extinguisher placed
there by the house's original occupants. Ruduse landed a vicious crack
on Lirpa's head and sent him careering against the rear wall of the
house. Ruduse swept in with another fierce blow, spinning Lirpa against
the window frame. With a short cry, Lirpa fell through the open space.
There was a short pause, followed by a series of agonised, inhuman
screams. The Doctor scurried across the room, taking the bucket of sand
as he went. He peered out onto the beach and stared in horror. Lirpa
had fallen backwards into a rock pool and was thrashing about as though
it was electrified. He screamed horribly, steam pouring from his body.
The sea water in the pool was changing to a murky grey sludge. The
Doctor felt a sharp blow as Ruduse shoved him in the small of the back.
He tumbled out of the window, and the bucket spun away onto the rocks
with a dull clang. Ruduse's shadow fell over the Doctor where he lay on
the beach. The Rhiptogan had walked around the house and was now
standing cautiously behind the pool where Lirpa had died. Lirpa's whole
torso seemed to have dissolved, and his pale yellow bones pricked the
murky surface of the water. Only his head lay free of the pool, the
dead face frozen in an agonised grimace. Ruduse seized the knotted
braids on the corpse and with a savage jerk, pulled the head clean
away. She loomed over the Doctor then waved her fingers at him. "Bonne
après-midi." she said, and went back round the house. Smoke and flames
curled out of the open window. The Doctor heard the Mini Moke's engine
revving as it raced away up the hill.<br><br>"Bloody hell," Sam told
herself, "it's another spaceship. First a police box and now this.
Where's your disposable camera when you really need it?"<br>Ladeeth had
seemed pleased to show her around, like some reptilian estate agent.
Here's the main bedroom, here's the downstairs cloakroom, this is the
intergalactic flight deck, the kids'll &nbsp;love it. With a little
prompting, he had also explained how the ship got there. He and his
fellow Rhiptogan, who was called Lirpa, had fled from their enemies and
tried to hide on Earth. Since Rhiptogans die in salt water, who'd think
of hunting for them on a planet where two thirds of the surface was
poisonous to them? But a hunter called Ruduse had pursued them, knowing
that she could earn bounty money by capturing them dead or alive. In
the chase, Ladeeth and Lirpa crash-landed their escape shuttle several
weeks ago, since when they'd been in hiding, trying to repair it and to
recover the parts that got lost in the crash. "Tricky," explained
Ladeeth. He moved a switch on the control panel and the main entrance
hatch slid down. "Some of the pieces wash up on the beach and that's
not always safe for us."<br>"Suit DIY enthusiast," said Sam, looking
around the flight deck at the scorched controls. They seemed to blur
before her eyes, and she felt giddy. "I need to sit down. My legs are
killing me." Her arms felt heavy and nerveless, like she'd been
sleeping on them. "You say you're not a killer. What makes you think
I'm not?"<br>"You're just a human," replied Ladeeth.<br>Sam rubbed her bleary eyes. "You're very chatty for a guy on the run. I could tell Tomorrow's World all about you."<br>Ladeeth smiled sadly. "You won't be able to tell anyone about this."<br>Sam
tried to sit up but she felt too heavy and tired. "Censorship, mind
control, bribery?" she mumbled. Her voice was slurred, just like after
the Coal Hill disco, that one and only drinking binge when she was
sixteen.<br>"You're dying." said Ladeeth quietly. He pointed to her
legs and Sam was shocked to see that her skin was covered in white
lumps. Ladeeth now activated a screen which showed the shuttle
entrance. "You've been poisoned by those Rhiptogan Adeekee plants
outside. They are this ship's natural defence shield from local fauna.
I'm sorry." He turned away, working at another panel of controls. <br>Sam
felt her heart pumping furiously. No, that would speed up the effect.
Damn it. How long, she wanted to ask, and how could he be so cold, so
emotionless, so inhuman? Her anger flared. No, stay calm, stay calm.
There was movement on the screen. Her heart pumped wildly again. It was
the Doctor, picking his way cautiously through the undergrowth. She had
to stop him, to warn him. Sam lifted her lead weight arm and reached
for the switch that Ladeeth had used earlier. Her fingers spasmed, so
she thumped the switch with the heel of her hand. There was a metallic
clang from nearby as the hatch opened. Sam bellowed a warning to the
Doctor about the stinging plants, her voice hoarse with the effort.<br>"You little fool," hissed Ladeeth, lurching to his feet. But he knew it was too late. "That's what a killer looks like." <br>Sam
followed his terrified gaze to the doorway, where the Doctor's familiar
figure was brushing idly at the lapel of his long green velvet coat.
Sam was relieved to see he was wearing his slip-on shoes and grey serge
trousers. She felt stronger, and got carefully to her feet. <br>"Did you touch the plants outside? They're poisonous, Doctor. "<br>"Adeekee
blooms," said the newcomer, calmly. "I know." He blinked at her and
brought his other hand forward. It was clutching the bloody severed
head of a Rhiptogan. <br>Ladeeth choked back a sob. "That's no Doctor. It is Ruduse."<br>Sam
thought her eyes were blurring again. The newcomer reformed into a tall
female Rhiptogan dressed in a dark grey tunic. In her waistband was a
large wooden-handled machete. To Sam it looked like a knife she'd seen
slicing effortlessly through a whole coconut in a TV ad for chocolate.
She shuddered as Ruduse slid the heavy weapon from her belt.<br>"I
thought it would be more difficult to get in," said Ruduse. "You really
are a careless cretin, Ladeeth. Valuable, of course, but still a
cretin."<br>Ruduse dropped the head, which struck the floor with a dull
thud. She weighed the heavy knife easily in her hand, preparing to
strike. Ladeeth suddenly seized Sam and pulled her back against him as
a shield. She struggled feebly, but his grip tightened across her neck
and her skin stung like a raw wound. Ruduse laughed, then her face
hardened and she lunged towards them. Ladeeth shifted left, dragging
Sam with him. The machete swung down behind them, slicing through the
flimsy flight control panel with a shearing sound. Ladeeth shoved Sam
like a dead weight again Ruduse's outstretched arm. Sam and Ruduse
tumbled to the floor, the big knife skittering across the flight deck.
Ladeeth sprang for the exit, but Ruduse seized Sam bodily and hurled
her at him like a rag doll. He caught Sam and pushed her aside to make
his escape, but Ruduse was faster, throwing a savage backhand blow at
Ladeeth which connected with his head. He smashed into the control
panel and dropped to the floor, where he lay, broken and still. Sam lay
crumpled beside him, looking up. Ruduse had recovered the knife, and
swung to cover her and Ladeeth. Sam's vision smeared as the exertion
and the poison took effect. The machete seemed enormous now. <br><br>"Oh,
have I missed the floor show?" said a querulous voice from the doorway.
"I had hoped to arrive before the knife thrower came on."<br>Sam turned
in surprise. The Doctor was standing in the doorway, his ragged shirt a
patchwork of dirt and bloodstains. A rusty red bucket swung in his
grip, water slopping over the side. <br>"Drop the knife," he snapped
at Ruduse, "and let Sam go, or I'll drench you with salt water.
Terribly bad for the Rhiptogan complexion, I've discovered." He raised
the bucket in both hands. "I want you to take your blood feud far away
from this planet." <br>Sam struggled to her feet, watching him
cautiously. "Doctor," she croaked, "could you kill them? Is that why
you ran away from your own people?" She couldn't disguise her
disappointment. "It's cold-blooded murder."<br>The Doctor now looked away from Ruduse. "Well, they are reptiles, Sam."<br>She
choked back a sob. "Not quite my point." she said. But when she stared
into his eyes, she was surprised to see him roll them despairingly.<br>"Sam." he said in a warning tone. <br>Ruduse's
flat grey face split in a wide grin. She brandished the machete. "Go
ahead, Doctor. Your stupid friend is right. You can't do it, can you."<br>The
Doctor bent his arms and threw the bucket forward. Sam yelled in
horror. Water sluiced low across the floor and Ruduse leapt backwards
out of the way. The Doctor set the half empty bucket down on the floor,
stepped into the spreading patch of sea water and dragged Sam towards
the exit. "Get outside to safety, Sam." He stooped to examine the
crumpled form of Ladeeth. "I'm afraid this one's injuries are quite
severe." <br>His words were choke off by Ruduse, who had clambered
over the control console to avoid the sea water. She grabbed the Doctor
by the hair, pulling his head back and leaving his neck bare. The knife
glittered in her other hand. "Don't worry about Ladeeth, Doctor,"
sneered Ruduse. "Dead or alive, the bounty's the same. And are you also
a runaway? Perhaps there's a bounty on your head too?"<br>The Doctor
struggled in Ruduse's fierce grip as the knife approached his neck. Sam
seized the fire bucket and flung the remaining water past them and into
the smashed shuttle controls. A fierce crackle of power bloomed into a
flash of sparks and flame. Ruduse roared and leapt aside, the knife
falling from her grasp. The Doctor pried himself free. Sam looked back
as the Doctor was bundling her through the exit. Ruduse tried to follow
them but gave a sudden howl of pain. The heavy knife had fallen beside
the crumpled form of Ladeeth, who summoned up enough strength to take
it and plunge it into Ruduse's foot. The female Rhiptogan slumped to
the ground, where her outstretched hand splashed into the pool of
water. The skin immediately fizzed and burned, and Ruduse screamed
again. Ladeeth painfully dragged himself to his knees, ready to plunge
the knife into Ruduse as the flames licked higher on the console behind
them. They vanished from Sam's view as the Doctor dragged her through
the undergrowth and away from the shuttle. They had barely thrown
themselves onto the beach before the shuttle exploded with a dull
thump.&nbsp;<br><br>When Sam opened her eyes, cool salt water was lapping around her. The Doctor had carried her into the sea in his arms. <br>"That
should ease the urticaria on your skin", he said, as he waded back onto
the beach. "Now, we must hurry to the Tardis for some proper treatment."<br>A purple Volkswagen Beetle stood incongruously on the sand. <br>"You've brought your own transport?" Sam asked, weakly. <br>"I
drove it here from the Tardis when I worked out where Ruduse would be
heading," smiled the Doctor. "I'm afraid it's much smaller inside than
it appears from the outside. <br><br>Later that day, Sam wriggled
deeper into her canvas deck chair and re-read her postcard in the
fading sunset. The card showed a view of Silhouette Island, the sea
azure, the sky brochure blue. On the reverse, alongside her message,
was her parent's address in blobby black biro. Sam folded the postcard
in half and stuffed it back into her pocket. <br>"Come on, Sam, it's your turn." said the Doctor. <br>Sam closed her eyes. "I've never churned up a beach in a VW," she said. <br>The
Doctor gave an apologetic cough. Sam could hear his deck chair creak as
he sat up to look at the deep ruts in the sand. "Four points apiece,"
he said. "Now, the decider, and it's my turn." He cleared his throat
theatrically. "I've never destroyed an alien spaceship with a bucket of
sea water."<br>Sam took a deep breath of the warm evening air, then
exhaled slowly. She opened her eyes, stood up and stretched. "You win,"
she said. "London here we come."<br>The Doctor was clumsily folding up his deck chair. "Yes, I get to choose your next destination."<br>When
Sam looked at him, he was smiling. It was the kind of smile, she
thought, that people might have when they finally made a difficult
decision. <br>The Doctor had become entangled in the deck chair. He
fumbled around in his waistcoat pocket, muttering under his breath, "It
was here a moment ago. Ah, yes." He pulled out a piece of long piece of
thick looped wool. Attached to the end, shining in the remaining
sunlight, was a silvery metal shape. "Another spare key," he said, and
held it out to her. Sam studied it briefly before she reached out to
take it. "I understand you've never visited Pluto," said the Doctor as
he extricated himself from the deck chair and started off across the
sand towards the Tardis. "Well, there's no time like the future, is
there?"</font></td>
